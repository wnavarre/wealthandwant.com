Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small></small><small>So if a person is poor, it is not because he is
lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save! ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege.
<strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>
Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the firm has
a charter from a government.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
others.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small> <small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as <em>Monopoly</em> does, pay everyone some regular
    income &#8212; not through redistribution of income, but through predistribution
    of common property? One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As
    noted earlier, the Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases
    to invest in stocks, bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments
    pays yearly dividends to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended
    to any state or nation, whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance,
    have an American Permanent Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents
    of all 50 states. The reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p><strong>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent
      of the population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we
      wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</strong></p>
  <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
    worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would pay
    equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell, so
    would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all boats.
    America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>So far I&#8217;ve focused on the commons of nature and community. In
        this chapter I explore the third fork of the commons river, culture.
        By this I mean the gifts of language, art, and science we inherit, plus
        the contributions we make as we live.</p>
      <p>Culture is a joint undertaking &#8212; a co-production &#8212; of individuals
        and society. The symphonies of Mozart, like the songs of Lennon and McCartney,
        are works of genius. But they also arise from the culture in which that
        genius lives. The instrumentation, the notation system, and the prevalent
        musical forms are the dough from which composers bake their cakes. So
        too with ideas. All thinkers and writers draw on stories and discoveries
        that have been developed by countless men and women before them. To paraphrase
        Isaac Newton, each generation sees a little farther because it stands
        on the shoulders of its predecessors. In this way, all new work draws
        from the commons and then enriches it. To keep art and science flourishing,
        we have to make sure the cultural commons is cared for.</p>
      <p>In addition, unlike most natural commons, the cultural commons is inexhaustible.
        Shakespeare&#8217;s plays can be &#8220;used&#8221; again and again without
        diminishing them. The same is true of Newton&#8217;s theories, Beethoven&#8217;s
        string quartets, and the information on the World Wide Web. Indeed, the
        more we use these assets, the more value they bestow. And thanks to technology &#8212; from
        Gutenberg&#8217;s press to Marconi&#8217;s radio to the globe-spanning
        Internet &#8212; sharing this wealth has become increasingly easy.</p>
      <p>Today, unfortunately, this cultural commons, like the commons of nature
        and community, is being enclosed by private corporations. The danger
        is that corporations will deplete the soil in which culture grows. The
        remedy is to reinvigorate the cultural commons. ...</p>
      <p>Patently Unscientific</p>
      <p>Enclosure of the commons has also been occurring in the world of science.
        Here, too, the Founders&#8217; intentions were clear. Ben Franklin, no
        slouch when it came to the dollar, never sought a patent on his most
        famous invention, the Franklin stove. &#8220;As we enjoy great advantages
        from the inventions of others,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;we should be glad
        to serve others by any invention of ours.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson, who
        served as first head of the U.S. Patent Office, believed the purpose
        of the office was to promulgate inventions, not protect them. He rejected
        nearly half the applications submitted during his term. (Eli Whitney&#8217;s
        cotton gin made it through.)</p>
      <p>As with copyrights, this stringent approach to patents worked well for
        a long time. America didn&#8217;t lack inventiveness in the nineteenth
        and early twentieth centuries (and let it be remembered that we stole
        much of our early technology from the British). But from midcentury to
        the present, patenting has become a national pastime. The Bayh-Dole Act
        of 1980, which let universities get patents on taxpayer-funded research
        and license those patents to corporations, opened the floodgates. Corporate
        money rushed into academic labs, and with it came a corporate mindset.
        Where scientists once shared their discoveries openly, many now fear
        to discuss them, lest someone beat them to the patent office. Today,
        some say, the secrecy is so intense and the thicket of property rights
        so dense that the advancement of research has noticeably slowed.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Patent Office has gone along with this, issuing patents for
        everything from one-click shopping on the Internet to genes that are
        99 percent nature-made. Often, companies get patents not with the intention
        of developing them, but rather with the intention of suing someone else
        who might (a practice known as patent trolling). Figure 8.1 shows the
        dramatic rise in number of patents issued over the past few decades.</p>
      <p>Consumers and taxpayers are burdened as well. Thanks to patents, pharmaceutical
        companies can charge monopoly prices for up to twenty years after introducing
        a new drug. This is said to benefit society by providing incentives for
        research, but according to the Center for Economic Policy Research, the
        benefit is greatly exceeded by the cost. Pharmaceutical companies spend
        about $25 billion a year on research, of which about 70 percent is for
        copycat drugs that mimic competitors&#8217; brands and add no significant
        health benefits.</p>
      <p>The federal government could fund 100 percent of noncopycat research &#8212; and
        place the resulting drugs in the public domain &#8212; entirely from
        cost savings to Medicare and Medicaid. On top of that, the savings to
        consumers from lower drug costs would amount to hundreds of billions
        of dollars each year.</p>
      <p>To release science from corporate control, we need to take a twofold
        approach: apply more stringent standards for issuing patents, and provide
        more public funds for research (with the proviso that publicly funded
        discoveries stay in the public domain). The track record for publicly
        funded research has, in fact, been phenomenal. The entire computer industry
        was spawned by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, which produced the first
        digital computer in 1945. Similarly, the Internet emerged from the Defense
        Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation
        in the 1980s. It&#8217;s hard to imagine the modern world without either
        of these breakthroughs, or with the Internet being owned, say, by Verizon
        or TimeWarner. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
