<blockquote>
  <p>    For reasons I can't fully explain, I had a lot of difficulty wrapping
  my mind around the economic concept of rent.&nbsp; Sometimes it came
  into clear focus, and other times the clarity receded.&nbsp; I've
  gathered a bunch of references here in the hope that they will help you
  achieve &#8212;  and keep &#8212; clarity!  </p>
  <p>Rent, as the term is used on this website is a bit different from the common
    usage.&nbsp; In common usage, we  use the word rent to mean the
    monthly payment to one's landlord for the use of all or part of a building
    at a particular location.&nbsp; But
    good economists are more precise: rent is the annual value of a piece of
    <strong><em>land</em></strong>, the amount a person who wants to use a particular
    site owes for the use of that site.&nbsp; Even if there is an improvement
    on that site &#8212; a parking lot, a house, a high-rise building &#8212; the
    amount one pays for that
    improvement <em>in that location</em> may be largely land rent.&nbsp; Think
    about the market value of a, say, four-bedroom, two bath colonial-style 30
    year old home in a small town and an identical home on a similar-sized lot
    within commuting range of New York City.&nbsp; They would sell for very different
    prices, and rent for very different prices.&nbsp; The difference is a difference
    in land rent.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Buildings, by their nature, are depreciating, though an attentive owner
    can slow that depreciation by continuous maintenance and occasional re-novation.
    Land tends to appreciate, assuming that the local population is growing and
    the particular property is located close enough to the center of things to
    be appealing to a significant portion of the population.</p>
  <p>The way economics is taught and much of common usage causes us to conflate
    land and capital as a single factor of production, when in fact they are
    completely different from each other. Failing to make the important distinction
    between land and capital &#8212; and therefore between rent and interest,
    the respective returns on land and capital &#8212; leads to all sorts of
    distortions, inequities and iniquities. Think precisely!</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The Land for the
  People</a> (1889 speech)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <small>I said that rent is a natural thing. So it is. Where one man, all
      rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than another
      man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the difference. Where one
      man has a piece of land and others have none, it gives him a special advantage;
      it is only fair that he should pay into the common fund the value of that
      special privilege granted him by the community. That is what is called <b>economic
      rent</b>.<br>
        <br>
    BUT over and above the economic rent there is the power that comes by monopoly,
    there is the power to extract a rent, which may be called <b>monopoly rent</b>.
    On this island that I have supposed we go and settle on, under the plan we
    have proposed each man should pay annually to the special fund in accordance
    with the special privilege the peculiar value of the piece of land he held,
    and those who had land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent
    that would be payable by the individual to the community would only amount
    to the value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
    But if one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people were
    fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the island and
    say it belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly rent; I could make
    you pay me every penny that you earned, save just enough for you to live;
    and the reason I could not make you pay more is simply this, that if you
    would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to
        hold land idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax
        up land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest landowners
        could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere that simple plan
        would compel the landowner either to use his land or to sell out to some
        one who would; and the rent of land would then fall to its true economic
        rate--the value of the special privilege it gave would go not to individuals,
        but to the general community, to be used for the benefit of the whole
        community.<strong>&nbsp;... &nbsp;</strong> </small></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <b>THE way to secure equality is plain.
      It is not by dividing the land; it is by calling upon those who are allowed
      possession of pieces of land giving special advantage to pay to the whole
      community, the rest of the people, aye, and including themselves--to the
      whole people, a fair rent or premium for that privilege, and using the
      fund so obtained for the benefit of the whole people. </b>What we would
      do would be to make the whole people the general landlord, to have whatever
      rent is paid for the use of land to go, not into the pockets of individual
      landlords, but into the treasury of the general community, where it could
      be used for the common benefit. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, rent is a natural and just thing. For
    instance, if we in this room were to go together to a new country and we
    were to agree that we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how
    could we divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue equality?
    If it were proposed that we should divide it up into equal pieces, there
    would be in the first place this objection, that in our division we would
    not fully know the character of the land; one man would get a more valuable
    piece than the other. Then as time passed the value of different pieces of
    land would change, and further than that if we were once to make a division
    and then allow full and absolute ownership of the land, <strong>inequality</strong> would
    come up in the succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another
    man, on the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one
    man would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
    little while many of these people would have parted with their land to others,
    so that their children coming after them into the world would have no land.
    <strong>The only fair way would be this-- that any man among us should be
    at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use it, that no one else wanted
    to use;
    that where more than one man wanted to use the same piece of land, the man
    who did use it should pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being
    used for the benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. </strong>That would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE problem is how to apply that to an
    old country. True we are confronted with this fact all over the civilized
    world that a certain class have got possession of the land, and want to hold
    it. Now one of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
    some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for the
    people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I do not think
    that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at that time a most important <b>third
    way</b>, and that is the way we advocate. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what we call
      the single tax. We propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of
      all the taxes that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a
      tax upon the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone --
      not upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the exercise
      of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the individual;
      but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of the improvements,
      so that an acre of land that has not been improved will pay as much tax
      as an acre of like land that has been improved. So that in a town a house
      site on which there is no building shall be called upon to pay just as
      much tax as a house site on which there is a house.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that rent is a natural thing. So
    it is. Where one man, all rights being equal, has a piece of land of better
    quality than another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the difference.
    Where one man has a piece of land and others have none, it gives him a special
    advantage; it is only fair that he should pay into the common fund the value
    of that special privilege granted him by the community. That is what is called <b>economic
    rent</b>.</small> <small>BUT over and above the economic rent there is the
    power that comes by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which
    may be called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we
    go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay annually
    to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege the peculiar
    value of the piece of land he held, and those who had land of no peculiar
    value should pay nothing. That rent that would be payable by the individual
    to the community would only amount to the value of the special privilege
    that he enjoyed from the community. But <span style="font-weight: bold;">if
    one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people were fools
    enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the island and say it
    belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly rent; I could make you pay
    me every penny that you earned, save just enough for you to live; and the
    reason I could not make you pay more is simply this, that if you would pay
    more you would die.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to hold land
  idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up land to its
  full value and that power would be gone; the richest landowners could not afford
  to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere that simple plan would compel the landowner
  either to use his land or to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of
  land would then fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege
  it gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be used
  for the benefit of the whole community. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I cannot pass on without mentioning the
    name of one of the distinguished Irishmen who have declared for the principle
    long before they heard of me. I refer to only one name. Many of you know,
    and doubtless all of you have heard, of Dr. Nulty, the Bishop of Meath.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IN 1881, before I had ever been in Ireland
    or Dr. Nulty had ever heard of me, he wrote <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">a
    letter on the Land Question to the clergy and laity of the diocese of Meath</a>.
    Dr. Nulty lays down precisely the principle that I have endeavored to lay
    down here before you briefly, that there is a right of ownership that comes
    from work, from production; that it is the law of nature, the law of God, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>that all men should work; </small></li>
  <li><small>that what a man produces by his labor belongs to him; </small></li>
  <li><small>that the reservoir from which everything must come -- the land itself
      -- can belong to no man, and </small></li>
  <li><small>that its proper treatment is just as I have proposed to let there
      be security of possession and to let those who have special privileges
      pay into the common fund for those privileges, and to use that fund for
      the benefit of all. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dr. Nulty goes on to say what every man
    who has studied this subject will cordially endorse, that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the natural law of rent -- that law by which
    population increases the value of land in certain places and makes it grow
    higher and higher -- that principle by which, as the city grows, land becomes
    more valuable -- that that is to his mind </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the clearest and best
    proof, not merely of the intelligence but of the beneficence of the Creator</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> For he shows clearly that that
    is the natural provision by virtue of which, if men would only obey God's
    law of justice, if men would only obey the fundamental maxim of Christianity
    to do to others as they would be done to them: that by virtue of that provision,
    as the advance of civilization went on, it would be towards a greater and
    greater equality among men-not a now to a more and more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; <a

Here, for instance, is a piece of land that has a value &#8212; let it be
where it may. Its rent, or value, is the highest price that anyone will

      look or what examples you select, you will see that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every
      form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is only undertaken
      after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for himself, and everywhere
      today the man or the public body who wishes to put land to its highest
      use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land values to the man who is
      putting it to an inferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. </span>All
      comes back to the land value, and its owner for the time being is able
      to levy his toll upon all other forms of wealth and upon every form of
      industry. A portion, in some cases the whole, of every benefit which is
      laboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land value,
      and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket. If there is
      a rise in wages, rents are able to move forward, because the workers can
      afford to pay a little more. If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway
      or the institution of an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering
      of fares or a new invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit
      to the workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to
      live, and therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of
      the other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The rent of land is the amount of money
      that would be bid for the use of land in an auction.</b> It can be thought
      of as 100 [rubles] more than the second-highest bid, that is, the amount

<p>Fred Foldvary:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rent.html">The Rent,
the Whole Rent, and Nothing but the Rent</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent is the highest bid that a normal
    tenant would pay for the use of land. Economists have divided the resources
    that go into production into land, labor, and capital goods. The wealth that
    is produced is distributed to the owners of these three "factors of production." That
    portion that goes to landowners is rent. ... </small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../auth/Tideman.html">Professor
        Nicolaus Tideman</a> defines rent more precisely as the "second highest
        bid for the use of land when it is unimproved, when the user has an option
        on continued use into the indefinite future." </span>In an ideal auction,
        we want the good to go to the highest bidder but at the price set by
        the second-highest bid, to avoid penalizing too-high bidding. In practice,
        if the folks who want to rent land have no special emotional attachment
        to a site, then the highest bids will be similar.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Land includes all natural resources, including </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the spatial surface of the earth, </small></li>
  <li><small>material resources such as water and minerals, </small></li>
  <li><small>the radio spectrum, </small></li>
  <li><small>the atmosphere used for travel or as a dump, </small></li>
  <li><small>all wildlife, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the genetic information in living beings.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A tenant's
      payment for a site has two components. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The pure land rent is the natural rent, the payment for the resource
      as provided by nature. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second component is a rental for the advantages of a site due
      to the civic works. This is the infrastructure such as streets, parks,
      utilities, security, schools, and the legal system which makes real estate
      much more useful. This rental is really a return to capital goods and labor
      services rather than land.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Real-estate land rent and rentals arise
    from the differing productivity of various sites: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">rent is the differential
    between the productivity of a site relative to the least productive marginal
    sites</span>. ...</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If we regard human beings as
        having equal moral worth, then it is morally wrong for some to be masters
        and others slaves.</span> Each person therefore has proper moral ownership
        of his labor and wage. Such self-ownership does not extend to land, but
        people may properly have individual rights to possess land, since this
        is necessary for the application of labor, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it is efficient for land to be under private title
        and control.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But it is not necessary for efficiency
        for the pure land rent to belong to the individual title holder. </span>Economists
        use the term "economic rent" for payments beyond what is needed to put
        a factor of production to efficient use. Land rent is economic rent,
        since the land is already there, and for real estate, the amount of land
        within some boundary line is fixed. So when rent is used for the public
        finances, it does not reduce the quantity of land. The rent will not
        be passed on to the tenant, since the payment of the rent to a community
        does not change the supply or demand for land.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>The use of rent for public revenues therefore has no excess burden,
        no burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and transactions
        do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and reducing the
        quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where the people
        most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while rent-based
        payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of land rather
        than raise it.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal source
        of general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should therefore
        shift to rent as the primary source of general funds. Pollution charges
        can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered a rental charge
        for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and other forms of
        land. There could also be user fees for services specific to users, fines
        for violating traffic rules, and profits from enterprises.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from minerals,
        water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
        by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
        of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the circumstances.&nbsp; ... <br>
        <br>
        </span> The public and community collection of rent puts land at its
        most productive use, maximizing the wages of workers while minimizing
        sprawl as well as boom/bust cycles. We need to understand rent to fully
        understand the market process and the cause and remedy of many of today's
        social problems</small>.<small><span

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs
      a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new building
      on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the
      real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this
      land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is good,
      the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good
      and very fast, and business is good here." </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real
      estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the
      person who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
      build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
      at all!&quot;</p>

  <p>Now I&nbsp;don't need to use the word "rent" in that explanation. ... <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">see

    Case for Taxing Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">        <small>The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means that
        care must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp; There
        is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount
        of money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp; How&shy;ever,
        this formulation is not always useful for defining the rent of land over
        a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor spends a year and &pound;20
        million erecting a building that is expected to last for 30 years, what
        was the rent of the land under the building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It
        is not sensible to say that, if the best possible use of the land produces
        a negative cash flow over a given interval of time, then land has no
        rental value over that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the
        decision to construct the structure was optimal, the finished building
        would have a value that was greater than its cost of construction by
        the rent of the land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction
        costs and land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision
        is made, that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does
        not depend on when construction happens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the
        rent of land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
        in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask, &#8216;Suppose
        that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp; Perhaps by
        that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21 million building
        rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one developed the
        most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to the constraint
        that the land be left vacant for the first year, how much lower would
        the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer to this
        question, the loss of the present value of net returns from postponing
        use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for the year.&nbsp; This
        is the amount of money that one would need to get in net returns from
        some pre-existing use to justify postponing redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus
        the rent of land for any developed site, for any year, is defined to
        be the answer to the question, &#8216;If this site were undeveloped,
        what would be the cost of leaving undeveloped and unused for a year?&#8217;</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Land also differs from labor and capital in the origin of claims
to own it.&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Labor can be defined as the factors of production that own themselves.&nbsp; </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of capital is derived originally from organizing its production
      and paying the various factors that are employed to produce it.&nbsp; </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of land, by contrast, derives from rights of exclusive
      use and access that are granted by governments.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ownership of land is thus a form of privilege.&nbsp; The
    word &#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
    law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it,
    that is, a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted
    to do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
    one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be &#8216;owned&#8217;,
    but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;, subject to a payment
    that reflected the value given up by others in allowing one person to have
    exclusive use of a site. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
      state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
      with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
  Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any one thing
    and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on the property
    tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss, political favoritism,
    and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood tenure. Echoing Thoreau,
    the more familiar reforms have failed to address this many-headed hydra at
    its root. To think that the root could be chopped by a mere shift in the
    property tax base -- from buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome
    of unfounded faith. Yet the evidence shows that state and local tax activists
    do have a powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
    efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the site's
    full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land is a lower
    or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
  </small>
    <p><small><font size="3"><small>In real estate there are two basic tautologies. </small></font></small></p>
    <ul>
      <li><small><font size="3"><small>One, land value is unrealized rent and

      <li><small><font size="3"><small>Two, the annual rental income from a parcel
              is its market price multiplied by the interest rate, and land price
              is capitalized land rent (usually over a 30 year term). Since collecting
              land rent shrinks, even eliminates, land price, it becomes necessary
              to determine annual rent and use that as a basis for the rate on
              land.</small></font></small></li>

  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Rent
  becomes critically important in Georgist economics, because rent is the increment
  of market gain that accrues to choice land parcels. This insight arose originally
  in the context of agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land
  were recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
  investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone
  to keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the efforts
  of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a higher yield
  separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment might represent,
  this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what might be minimally expected.
  This is land rent, and it exists even if it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as
  earlier noted, the greatest land rents derive from their location, grown out
  of nearby social investment.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because it is
  so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled in economics
  at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship to the word rent as
  it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is, when one rents a car or an
  apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus, defined as the return on investment above
  and beyond what is minimally required to bring a service into production. To
  take just an elementary example, consider that there are three parcels of land
  available for farming and three farmers of equal ability and enterprise. But
  suppose the parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
  fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality seed,
  the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the one with
  the highest quality land having the best return.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The one with the lowest quality land would in like
  fashion have the&nbsp;lowest return. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic
  rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest qualitatively measured by
  the difference between the parcel with the highest return and that with the
  lowest return</span></span>. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>As with all nineteenth century moral philosophers, Henry George subscribed
  to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as he saw it required
  that land be held in usufruct and that rent from such should be returned to
  society. The theory was inspired by his deeply religious roots and grounded
  in his reading of the prominent thinkers that predated him. The natural order
  was also a moral order, and the failure to comply with the order of nature
  and society as he saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land
  belonged to everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely
  one&#8217;s own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep
  the product of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate
  the earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands
  of rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to
  be shared. There were just and unjust taxes, and the only just tax was that
  which grew out of rent, of the unearned increment that visited certain land
  sites as windfall gains because of the efforts and investments by the community.
  Income and excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as
  especially were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means
  of ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
  of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent collection.
  There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says &#8220;Abolish all taxes;
  collect ground rent instead.&#8221; ... <a

      only recently, with the advent of data availability and increased computer

      possible tax design we could have.</span></small><br>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How the Railroads Got
Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago classical
    economic thought still regarded land for the most part as the common heritage
    of mankind. From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
    with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a function of
    three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John Locke also accepted
    these premises. To achieve optimal economic productivity, one had to exact
    the appropriate price from each of those factors. The price of labor was
    in wages; the price of capital was interest; and the price of land, particularly
    following the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rent in its classical sense means payment for the
    use of something in fixed supply, or, more generally, payments above the
    costs incurred for its creation. </span>Disequilibriums and inefficiencies
    in economic development resulted if the appropriate prices were not paid
    for each factor. But, as we shall see, there were powerful interests in this
    country, bent on not seeing any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded
    the nascent economics profession at the end of the 19th century no longer
    to regard land as a separate factor and to redefine the terms of production
    instead in two-factor theory. This was concurrent with the inclusion of land
    as property, since called "real property."</small><small>... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

    <small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts

    <br>
    <small>Today, on the other hand, the unearned surplus which classical
    economists called rent attaches to monopoly titles -- largely the
    scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
    totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
    vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
    recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
    comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
    eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
    the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
    explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
    efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span

    surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
    rightful entitlement.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
    cities
    where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
    such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
    hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
    personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
    than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
    only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
    Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
    luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
    million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
    obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
    values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
    to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
    a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
    mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
    direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
    attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
    areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
    United States illustrate the point. ...&nbsp; <a

    <p><b>Defining "The Rent of Land"</b></p>
    <p>To proceed, there must be agreement upon a definition of "the rent of land." From
      a conceptual or theoretical perspective, the rent of land is a residual.
      It is the difference between total revenue and costs other than land, when
      land is managed in such a way as to yield the greatest present value of

    <p>There are two practical difficulties with this definition. It yields an
      answer in terms of the present value of rent rather than an annual amount,
      and it does not provide an algorithm for public officials to follow. The
      two difficulties can both be overcome by using an operational concept of
      rent, defined in terms of what people are willing to pay. <strong>... </strong>. <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read the whole article</a></p>
