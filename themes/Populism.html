<blockquote>
  <p><small><small>Henry George's <a href="../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></a>,
    the #2 bestseller of the 1880s, played a signficant role in inspiring the populist
  movement. To quote Samuel Francis, writing in <em>American Renaissance</em> a few years
        ago,</small></small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><small>Historian Eric Goldman in his standard account of Progressive
                Era political    thought, <em>Rendezvous with Destiny</em> (pp. 78-79),
                explains how the thought    of Henry George&#8217;s book <em>Progress
                and Poverty</em>, the &#8220;most rounded
          and powerful note in a growing chorus,&#8221; helped popularize the idea
          that &#8220;an
          environment that had been made by human beings and could be changed by
          human beings&#8221; &#8220;determined all men, institutions, and ideas,&#8221; and
          that &#8220;legislating a better environment, particularly a better economic
          environment, could bring about a better world, and bring it about before
    unconscionable centuries.&#8221;<b>    </b></small></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Goldman himself paid tribute to <em>Progress and Poverty</em> with these words: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> For some years prior to 1952 I was working on a history of American reform
      and over and over again my research ran into this fact: an enormous number
      of men and women, strikingly different people, men and women who were to
      lead 20th century America in a dozen fields of humane activity, wrote or
      told someone
      that their whole thinking had been redirected by reading &quot;<em>Progress
      and Poverty</em>&quot; in their formative years. In this respect no other book came
      anywhere near comparable influence, and I would like to add this word of
      tribute to a volume which magically catalyzed the best yearnings of our
      fathers and
    grandfathers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>One might reasonably wonder why relatively few colleges today expose their
    students to such an experience! Let this website make up for your neglected
    education! Shall we wait unconscionable centuries for someone else to create
    the society that Americans have been yearning for?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot was a great leader
of the Conservation Movement.
He defined his central term, conservation, as "The greatest good for
the greatest number for the longest time." Caviling theorists
sometimes pick at that famous phrase, since you cannot maximize three
things at the same time, but that is unfair, since he was not being
technical. He was making a speech, and obviously what he meant was
that those three elements should all be considered, and none was to
be slighted.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notice especially the middle
clause, for the greatest number.
Conservation was not just for landowners, or any other elite.
Conservation was part of the Progressive Movement, which had sprung
from the Populist Movement. Social equity was at its core. Here is
some more of Pinchot's speech (to the 1st National Conservation
Congress, 1909):</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the third principle of conservation. It is
this: the natural resources must be developed and preserved for the
benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few</span>. ...
public action for public benefit has ... a much larger part to play
than was the case ... before certain constitutional arrangements ...
had given so tremendously strong a position to vested rights and
property in general. ... by reason of the 14th Amendment to The
Constitution, property rights in the U.S. occupy a stronger position
than in any other country in the civilized world. ... it becomes then a
matter of multiplied importance, ... when property rights once granted
are so strongly entrenched, that they shall be granted only under such
conditions as that the people shall get their fair share of the benefit
which comes from the development of the country which belongs to us
all. The time to do that is now.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You modern habitat-savers, your
foes score points against you by
calling you "elitists." Sure enough, you do appear a bit above, and
therefore outside the mainstream, especially when you talk down to
people from the eminence of "Science." Pinchot saw that brick coming
and dodged it before it was even thrown. He teamed up with the
populists; he spoke as a man for the people, even if not quite of
them. Can you say the same? Is there a place in your plans, and your
hearts, for Joe Sixpack?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a list that the Southern
California Association of
Governments (SCAG) has published from its recent public opinion
survey of public issues. Preserving habitat and endangered species
are not even among the top 17 priorities listed by citizens. Neither
are private property rights. Their top three concerns are crime,
education, and jobs. Politicians have preempted the crime issue, but
no one is doing a thing this year for education and jobs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Take a leaf
from the successful Gifford Pinchot: team up with some populists.
Move into the vacuum left behind the gale of anti-crime oratory. No
one is serving the constituency for education and jobs.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Other populist issues high on the
SCAG list are homelessness,
affordable housing, job training, and child care. </small><small><small><small><b><a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><small>read

George's "Single Tax"</a><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Hartzok_HG%27sST.html"></a></span> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, while riding
    horseback in the Oakland hills, merchant seaman and journalist Henry George
    had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that speculation
    and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the root causes of the
    unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
    George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy approach was
    known at that time as the "single tax" - meaning that taxation should be
    shifted off of labor and onto the socially created surplus value of land
    and other natural resources.</span> His message reached as far as the great
    Russian Leo Tolstoy, who was so taken with the idea that he frequently referred
    to George and "Georgism" in his novel Resurrection.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last 20 years of the 19th century George
  built an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of the wealth
  gap, and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's mayor. The "Georgists" were
  determined to free labor and all productive effort from the burden of taxation.
  Land and natural resources were gifts of nature to be fairly shared by all.
  The role of government would be to secure democratic rights to the earth for
  all people via the collection of resource rents, the surplus value accruing
  to natural wealth, which would be distributed in social goods, services or
  by direct citizen dividends.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as this
  solution to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist movement was
  stopped in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their money into leading
  schools of economics to encourage the writing of treatises against George and
  the movements he had spawned. </span>The ethical perspective that land is a
  common heritage and the policy approach of land value taxation were subsequently
  eliminated from the field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on
  only two primary factors -- labor and capital -- with capital having the upper
  hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of self-employment
  given access to land. This is what the elites and the plutocrats feared most
  - that labor would gain full power to directly produce capital given conditions
  of equal rights to the resources of the earth....&nbsp;</small> &nbsp;<small><small> </small><a

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_HG100YL_Reconciler.html">Henry George
  100
  Years Later: The Great Reconciler</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;  </small>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George (1839-1897) is best
known today for <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a> (1879). Eloquent, timely and challenging, this
book soon became and remains the all-time best-seller on economic
theory and policy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the
world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for
labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These twin plagues arose from
concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation. Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant
exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)
</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George followed his analysis
with a plausible, practicable
remedy: eliminate all taxes except for a tax on land values.</b> The
"single tax," as it later became known, would invigorate the economy
by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available to those
who would use it. And it would suck the air out of speculative
bubbles, damping the boom and bust cycle. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Taxing land is very progressive because land ownership is
highly concentrated among the most wealthy, far more concentrated than
income. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is fair, because the community rather than the
individual landowner creates land values. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is economically efficient, because the owner
cannot avoid a land tax ("shift" it) by choosing less-taxed options. ...</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George toured the world as an
immensely popular political
activist, orator and folk hero. He died suddenly in 1897, while
running a second time for Mayor of New York City. A hundred thousand
mourners marched at his funeral.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the US, "Georgism" melded into
the populist movement, and later
into the Progressive Movement. At the national level, the Progressive
Movement dominated both major political parties for 17 years,
1902-19. At the local level, its influence continued through the
early 1920s. Local property taxation was modified along Georgist
lines: land assessments were raised relative to improvements and
rates were increased substantially. California water districts
financed by land taxes catapulted California to the top-producing
farm state in the Union, using land that had been desert or range.
California generated farm jobs and homes, while other states
destroyed them by allowing well-connected speculators and "robber
barons" to grab large tracts of land. A Georgist, Congressman Warren
Worth Bailey of Pennsylvania, drafted <b>the first Federal personal
income tax law on Georgist lines: falling mainly on very high incomes
from property. ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical economists give us
only a hard choice: we may have
equity, or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program
reconciles equity and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and composes them into
one solution. He cuts the Gordian knot. Like Keynes after him, George
inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter tradeoffs; we can have it
all!"<span style="font-weight: normal;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><a
