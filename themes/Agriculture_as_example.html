<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
   Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">    </a>... When the agent of the Irish landlord takes from the Irish
      cottier
      for rent his pigs, his poultry, or his potatoes, or the money that he
      gains by the sale of these things, it is clear enough that this rent
      comes from the earnings of labor, and diminishes what the laborer
      gets. But is not this in reality just as clear when a dozen middlemen
      stand between laborer and landlord? Is it not just as clear when,
      instead of being paid monthly or quarterly or yearly, rent is paid in
      a lumped sum called purchase-money? Whence come the incomes which the
      owners of land in mining districts, in manufacturing districts, or in
      commercial districts, receive for the use of their land? Manifestly,
      they must come from the earnings of labor &#8211; there is no other
      source from which they can come. From what are the revenues of
      Trinity Church corporation drawn, if not from the earnings of labor?
      What is the source of the income of the Astors, if it is not the
      labor of laboring-men, women, and children? When a man makes a
      fortune by the rise of real estate, as in New York and elsewhere many
      men have done within the past few months, what does it mean? It means
      that he may have fine clothes, costly food, a grand house luxuriously
      furnished, etc. Now, these things are not the spontaneous fruits of
      the soil; neither do they fall from heaven, nor are they cast up by
      the sea. They are products of labor&#8211;can be produced only by
      labor. And hence, if men who do no labor get them, it must
      necessarily be at the expense of those who do labor. ...<br>
    <br>
    What is the difference? The Irish peasant cultivator hires his
      little farm from a landlord, and pays rent directly. The English
      agricultural laborer hires himself to an employing farmer who hires
      the land, and who out of the produce pays to the one his wages and to
      the other his rent. In both cases competition forces the laborer down
      to a bare living as a net return for his work, and only stops at that
      point because, when men do not get enough to live on, they die and
      cease to compete. And, in the same way, competition forces the
      employing farmer to give up to the landlord all that he has left
      after paying wages, save the ordinary returns of capital &#8211; for the
      profits of the English farmer do not, on the average, I understand,
      exceed five or six per cent. And in other businesses, such as
      manufacturing, competition in the same way forces down wages to the
      minimum of a bare living, while rent goes up and up. Thus is it clear
      that no change in methods or improvements in the processes of
      industry lessens the landlord's power of claiming the lion's
      share. ...<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">... I
      merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
      talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
    agriculture and to agricultural communities.</span> Nothing could be
      more
      erroneous. Land is necessary to all production, no matter what be the
      kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
      storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
      he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
      Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
      given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
      upon it. When this necessity is absolute, then does he necessarily
      become their absolute master. And just as this point is
      neared &#8211; that is to say, just as competition increases the demand
      for land &#8211; just in that degree does the power of taking a larger
      and larger share of the earnings of labor increase. It is this power
      that gives land its value; this is the power that enables the owner
      of valuable land to reap where he has not sown&#8211;to appropriate to
      himself wealth which he has had no share in producing. Rent is always
      the devourer of wages. <strong>The owner of city land takes, in the rents
      he receives for his land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does
      the owner of farming land. And whether he be working in a garret ten
      stories above the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet
      below the earth's surface, it is the competition for the use of land
      that ultimately determines what proportion of the produce of his
      labor the laborer will get for himself. </strong>This is the reason why modern
      progress does not tend to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why,
      with all the inventions and improvements and economies which so
      enormously increase productive power, wages everywhere tend to the
      minimum of a bare living. The cause that in Ireland produces poverty
      and distress&#8211;the ownership by some of the people of the land on
      which and from which the whole people must live &#8211; everywhere else
      produces the same results. It is this that produces the hideous
      squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this that makes want
      jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that forces little
      children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts mills, and
      that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps.
