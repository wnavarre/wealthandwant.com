        n. A part of the earth's
        surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property
        subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern
        society, and is eminently worthy of the superstructure. Carried to its
        logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others
        from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to
        occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in
        land is recognised. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma
          is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to
          be
        born, or, born as trespassers, to exist."</span> - Ambrose Bierce,

                  therefore, must be appraised as to how they affect, or are affected
                  by, this basic relation. It is perhaps this to which Soule refers when

  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
              burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until
              we consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
              in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
              inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
              as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
              a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor
              and capital.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
              and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
              this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
              the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
              instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor
              and capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken
              by the state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public
              purposes, would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided
              into two portions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div align="center">
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
                    producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="center">
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
                    in public benefits to all its members.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young
              children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well
              as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents
              the result of individual effort in production, the other represents
              the increased
              power with which the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
              community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
              as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
              equality.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
              may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers
              of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With present
              processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages are high,
              so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and machinery go
              on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to
          lose sight of the fact, that while thus preventing waste and thus adding
          to the efficiency of labor, the equalization
              in the distribution of wealth that would result from the simple
          plan of taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity with which
          wealth
          is pursued. It
              seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need
          fear poverty, no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no
          one would take the trouble to strive and to strain for it as men do
          now. For, certainly,
          the
              spectacle of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away
          their time for the sake of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and
          absurd, that in
              a state of society where the abolition of the fear of want had
          dissipated the envious admiration with which the masses of men now
          regard the
          possession of great riches, whoever would toil to acquire more than
          he cared to use
              would be looked upon as we would now look on a man who would thatch
          his head with half a dozen hats.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare it?
              Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development, it
              is not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come from
              the weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and what,
              if a remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
              of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production
              is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of
              the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire
              to get rich at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping
              together riches would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness.

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are selling land now in large quantities
                    to certain English lords, who are coming over here and buying greater
                    estates than the greatest in Great Britain or Ireland. We are selling
                    them land; they are buying land. Did it ever occur to you that they do
                    not want that land? They have no use whatever for American land; they
                    do not propose to come over here and live on it. They cannot carry it
                    over there to where they do live.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
                    from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
                    but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American citizens
                    will want to use it, and then they can say to these American citizens: "You
                    can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all you make upon it." What
                    we are selling those foreign lords is not really land; we are selling
                    them the labor of American citizens; we are selling them the privilege
                    of taking, without any return for it, the proceeds of the toil of our
            children.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
                    the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
                    hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
                    land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of getting
                    many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and carriages, houses
                    or much more food and wine. He has gained the power of taking for his
            own a great number of these products of human labor.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
                    off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
                    it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where does
                    it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human labor &#8212; someone
                    has to work for them. When a man who does no work can get them, necessarily
                    the people who do work to produce them must have less of the products
                    of human labor than they ought to have. ...&nbsp;<a

                    by the high prices demanded by some non-user? In the very heart of New

                  what land is? I know a little girl who has been going to school for
                  some time, studying geography, and all that sort of thing; and one
                  day she said to me: "Here is something about the surface of the
                  earth. I wonder what the surface of the earth looks like?" "Well," I
                  said, "look out into the yard there. That is
                  the surface of the earth." She said, "That the surface of
                  the earth? Our yard the surface of the earth? Why, I never thought of
                  it!" That is very much the case not only with grown men, but
                  with such wise beings as newspaper editors. They seem to think, when
                  you talk of land, that you always refer to farms; to think that the
                  land question is a question that relates entirely to farmers, as
                  though land had no other use than growing crops. Now, I should like
                  to know how a man could even edit a newspaper without having the use
                  of some land. He might swing himself by straps and go up in a
                  balloon, but he could not even then get along without land. What
                  supports the balloon in the air? Land; the surface of the earth. Let
                  the earth drop, and what would become of the balloon? The air that
                  supports the balloon is supported in turn by land. So it is with
                  everything else men can do. Whether a man is working away three
                  thousand feet under the surface of the earth or whether he is working
                  up in the top of one of those immense buildings that they have in New
                  York; whether he is ploughing the soil or sailing across the ocean,
          he is still using </small><small>land.</small>    </p>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Land! Why, in owning a piece of
                  ground, what do you own ? The
                  lawyers will tell you that you own from the centre of the earth right
                  up to heaven; and, so far as all human purposes go, you do. In New
                  York they are building houses thirteen and fourteen stories high.
                  What are men, living in those upper stories, paying for? There is a
                  friend of mine who has an office in one of them, and he estimates
                  that he pays by the cubic foot for air. Well, the man who owns the
                  surface of the land has the renting of the air up there, and would
        have if the buildings were carried up for miles. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This land question is the bottom question.
            Man is a land animal. Suppose you want to build a house; can you build
            it without a place
    to put it? What is it built of? Stone, or mortar, or wood, or
    iron &#8212; they all come from the earth. <b>Think of any article of wealth
    you choose, any of those things which men struggle for, where do they come from?
    From the land. It is the bottom question. The land question is simply the labour
    question; and when some men own that element from which all wealth must be drawn,
    and upon which all must live, then they have the power of living without work,
    and,
    therefore, those who do work get less of the products of work. </b> <strong>...</strong></small></p>

                  they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without

                    all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you

          <p>HE term Land in political economy means the natural or passive element
            in production, and includes the whole external world accessible to
            man, with all its powers, qualities, and products, except perhaps
            those portions of it which are for the time included in man's body
            or in his products, and which therefore temporarily belong to the

            nature into the category, land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

  </a><br>
THAT land is only a passive factor in production must be carefully kept in mind.
. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who
own land. . . . <br>
  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production
as landowners, and by virtue of that ownership, is as ridiculously impossible
as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

          <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the
            Bay of New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite
            the point where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers,
            board incoming steamers to ask strangers to take their first American
            swear, and where, if false oaths really colored the atmosphere the
            air would be bluer than is the sky on this gracious day. I turn from
            my writing-machine to the window, and drink in, with a pleasure that
            never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have spoken of land monopoly
                  as a cancer, and so it is. Yet land often cannot be used efficiently
                  unless monopolized. The Georgist remedy does not provide for the
                  excision of land monopoly but rather for its transformation from
                  malignant to benign. For the monopoly of land can be fair and even
                  salutary if the monopolizer pays into the public treasury a sum that
                  reflects substantially the market value of his privilege.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perhaps this would be a good
                  place to interject that when economists speak of "land," they are
                  talking about nature.</span> The term embraces not only space on the
                  earth's surface but also natural resources -- oil in the ground, virgin
                  timber, wildlife, the oceans and other natural bodies of water, the
                  airwaves, airspace, etc. To capture for the public the value of these
                  natural goods, land-value charges may in some cases need to be
                  supplanted by or combined with other methods such as severance taxes
                  and auctioning of leases. But the principle is the same. <a

                  the result is "privilege," which from its Latin roots means
"<b>private law</b>," that is, law that permits one person to do what
                  others are not permitted to do. Thus <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">what we stand for is an end to
        privilege.</span></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Numerous examples of privilege are
                  incorporated in our
        institutions.</small></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

                  import quotas, that would be best reformed by eliminating
                  restrictions and permitting all to do what now only some may do. For
                  other privileges, such as broadcast licenses and land titles, great
                  productivity results from the social understanding that a specified
                  individual will have the use of a given resource. For these
                  privileges, the best reform is the introduction of the requirement
                  that any person who is assigned such an opportunity must pay to the
                  public treasury an annual fee equal to what the opportunity would be

          <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
                  a case
                  for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
                  logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
                  follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
                  principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
                  the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
                  one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
                  is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
                  important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
          efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
                  because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
          for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
                  on land
                  would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
                  report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
                  shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
          in the Appendix.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
          taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
                  reasons
                  why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
          world peace.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
                  argument for
                  taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
                  offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
                  rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
                  price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
                  land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
                  increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
                  become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
          land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
                  on
                  land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
          the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
                  erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
                  because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
          collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
          <small>.</small><br>
          <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
                  that the
                  return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
          rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
                  what land
          is.</small><br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Land?</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>David Ricardo defined land, memorably, as &#8216;the original and
                  indestructible powers of the soil.&#8217;&nbsp; This definition is overly
                  narrow.&nbsp; It would exclude from land such valuable and
                  destruc&shy;tible things as minerals and topsoil. Ricardo&#8217;s definition
                  even suggests that the value of land arising from urban locations might
                  not be included in &#8216;land,&#8217; since it would not necessarily qualify as a
&#8216;power of the soil.&#8217;</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The definition of land that is most useful in economic theory is
                  that
                  land is all scarce factors of production other than people and the
                  products of human effort. Land is the gifts of nature.&nbsp; Thus land
                  includes both rural and urban territory, mineral resources, water, fish
                  in oceans and rivers, virgin forests, geosynchronous orbits and the
          frequency spectrum.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>While there is some tendency to think of measuring land in
&#8216;stock&#8217;
          terms (&#8216;What is the value of that piece of land?&#8217;), the flow of
                  services from land is more fundamental.&nbsp; While capital goods have
                  selling prices related to their costs of production, such a calculation
                  does not apply to land since, by definition, land is not
                  produced.&nbsp; The selling price of land is conceived in economic
                  theory as the present value of the net return after taxes to the future
                  flow of land services, when the land is used in the way that maximizes
                  that present value.&nbsp; Following David Ricardo, the value of the
                  flow of services from land is sometimes described as the residual after
                  paying other factors their opportunity costs, when land is used
                  efficiently.&nbsp; But in equilibrium, a similar statement can be made
          about any other factor.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>With some components of land, such as river water flowing into
                  an
                  ocean, the extent to which the land is used in one period has no
                  influence on the extent to which it can be used in other periods.&nbsp;
          In other cases, such as mineral deposits, use in one period comes at
                  the expense of use in other periods.&nbsp; Agricultural land has a
                  capacity to be &#8216;mined&#8217; of the nutri&shy;ents that make it productive,
          making it somewhat similar to mineral deposits.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>With urban land there is a different type of interdependency
                  between
                  use at one time and the potential flow of services at another.&nbsp; To
                  be used most productively, urban land must be combined with durable,
                  immobile capital.&nbsp; Therefore an increase in the intensity of urban
                  land use often requires the destruction of previous capital
                  investments.&nbsp; This intertemporal dependence means that, in
                  principle, a forecast of all future economic conditions is needed to
                  know what use of land is best today.&nbsp; Since people make different
                  forecasts, they reach different conclusions about what use of land is
                  best today.&nbsp; Only with the passage of time, if at all, is it
          possi&shy;ble to know what use of land would have been best.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means
                  that care
                  must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp;
          There is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount of
                  money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp;
          How&shy;ever, this formulation is not always useful for defining the
                  rent of land over a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor
                  spends a year and &pound;20 million erecting a building that is
                  expected to last for 30 years, what was the rent of the land under the
                  building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It is not sensible to
                  say that, if the best possible use of the land produces a negative cash
                  flow over a given interval of time, then land has no rental value over
                  that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the decision to
                  construct the structure was optimal, the finished building would have a
                  value that was greater than its cost of construction by the rent of the
                  land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction costs and
                  land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision is made,
          that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does not depend on
                  when
                  construction hap&shy;pens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the rent of
                  land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
                  in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask,
&#8216;Suppose that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp;
          Perhaps by that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21
                  million building rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one
                  developed the most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to
                  the constraint that the land be left vacant for the first year, how
                  much lower would the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer
                  to this question, the loss of the present value of net returns from
                  postponing use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for
                  the year.&nbsp; This is the amount of money that one would need to get
                  in net returns from some pre-existing use to justify postponing
                  redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus the rent of land for any developed

                  most people had to work the soil for a living, but modern agriculture

                Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
                  in using the rent of land to
                  finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
                  revenue as well:</small>
          <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
                  as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
                  radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
            <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
                  payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
            revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
                  pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
                  estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
                  on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
            cost.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
            value of surrounding land.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
                  crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
                  others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
                  is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
                  handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
            that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
            which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
                  electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
                  make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
                  is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
                  he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
                  increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
            covered by user charges.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
                  at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
                  tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
                  to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
                  pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
                  may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
                  it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
                  identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
            purposes.</small></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
                  of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
                  collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
                  excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
                  basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
                  finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
                  additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
                  all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
                  paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
                  tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
                  disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
          most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
          <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
                  the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
                  moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
                  of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
              corporations they will invest more...&nbsp; </small><a

                  space, not just solid surfaces. Land
                  includes water areas and the electro-magnetic spectrum, but the most
                  important potential source of public revenue from land is real estate
                  sites.</small><br>
          <br>
        <small>The characteristics of land are well known. </small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small>Land has a fixed supply. The space within some boundary
                can be neither expanded nor contracted. 
          </small></li>
          <li><small>Land is fixed not only in extent but also in mobility,
                unlike
                people, who can migrate, or capital goods, which are more or less
                mobile. 
          </small></li>
          <li><small>Land cannot be imported. Even in the case of buildings and
                other
                permanent structures, they differ from land in that they are created by
                human enterprise, and in that their creators decide where the structure
                will be located. 
          </small></li>
          <li><small>Finally, land is not something to be discovered. Once
                people
                figured out that the earth was a sphere, and its approximate size, they
                knew that the land was &#8220;out there.&#8221; Entrepreneurship is vital in
                discovering the best routes to land areas, it is vital in discovering
                the potential value of those areas, but it is not vital in discovering
                that the land is out there. That was known all along.&nbsp; <a

                  comprehensive, including all economic agents. Each was also
"limitational," meaning at least some of each was needed for

                  replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time,
                  and
                  relations of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite

                  gives 10 primary reasons why land is distinct from capital (and of
                  course
                  from mankind itself) as an economic input.&nbsp; Then it gives 18
                  important economic consequences thereof, and their policy
                  implications.&nbsp; Making land markets, land policy, and land taxation
                  work well for the general welfare is a major challenge for economists
                  and
                  statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it too long by crediting and
                  following the peculiar neo-classical sophisms that obscure or deny all

          <small><b>Land is not produced nor

          <small><b></b>Land is not produced, it was created.&nbsp; It is the
                  world, the
                  planet from which man evolved, with the sun that energizes it and the
                  orbit that tempers it.&nbsp; Land is a free gift, variously expressed
                  in
                  different philosophies as Spaceship Earth, the Big Blue Marble, God's
                  Gift, Creation, Gaia, The Promised Land, or nature.&nbsp; Mankind did
                  not
                  create The Earth with its space and resources, nor can we add to
                  them.&nbsp; We can only acquire them, often by fighting, or

                  disappointing,
                  and should alert us and make us suspicious, that economic analysis

                  things, too, that are
                  colloquially called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by
                  which many cities
                  are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
                  properly
                  land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
                  land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other
                  uses.&nbsp; Expanding cities take farmland from producing food and
                  fiber,
                  much of it for the expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow
                  water near cities is taken away from anglers and sailors and viewers
                  and
                  ecologists, who now routinely&nbsp; organize to prevent it being "made"

                  wetlands are taken away from endangered species, as well as from their
                  primal role as
                  filters protecting coastal waters from river trash and
                  pollutants.&nbsp;
        Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists, it has taken
                  militant
                  environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing in their
                  struggle
                  to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists and their
"way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are now coming
                  to terms with each other, after decades of mutual shunning.&nbsp; Too
                  many modern economists, however, still use their "way of thinking" to
                  seal out important new evidence that doesn't fit the model. </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Capital (K) is that which has been produced but not yet used
                  up.&nbsp;
          Capital is formed by human thrift, forbearance, investment and
                  production.&nbsp; Only after mankind forms and makes capital does it
                  bear
                  much likeness to land, in that they coexist.&nbsp; Ordinary
                  micro-economics obscures the differences because it deals mainly with
                  relations of coexistence, ignoring the continual formation and
                  destruction of capital, ignoring time and relations of sequence.&nbsp;
          Thus it excludes from its purview one of the prime differences between
                  land and capital.&nbsp; The life of capital, like that of people, is
                  marked by major sacraments of birth, growth, aging and death - all
                  missing from micro theory. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Economic
                  life is a cavalcade in which the birth and death of capital are dated
                  events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Micro deals mainly with how existing
                  resources are allocated at a moment in time, not how they originate,
          grow, flourish, reproduce, age, die, and decompose.</small><br>

          <small>Capital occupies space; land <i>is </i>space.&nbsp; In common
                  micro
                  theory, resources and markets come together at a point not just in time
                  but in space.&nbsp; Again, it excludes from its purview one of the
                  prime
        qualities of land.<small><span

                  is ironic that

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
          <small>For the reasons given, alone, land and capital are mutually

          <small><b></b>Land as "site" (location plus extension) does not
                  normally
                  wear out, depreciate, spoil, obsolesce, nor get used up by human
                  activities incident to occupancy and production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast, capital
                  depreciates from time and use, routinely and by nature.</span>&nbsp;
          After
                  being
                  formed, it must be conserved from entropy by continual maintenance,
                  repair, remodeling, safeguarding against theft and fire, and so on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>&nbsp;
          Like our own bodies, it returns
                  to dust;
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">land is the dust to which it returns</span>.&nbsp;
          Inventories are depleted;
                  moving parts wear out; fixed capital depreciates with use and
          time. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>No one can get more land without others
                  keeping less.&nbsp; One can
                  acquire more capital by forming it through saving and investing.&nbsp;
          One can consume more by working more, while others work no less.&nbsp;
          Land is different: it is the most common basis of market power,
          therefore. &nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>When demand grows for land in a specific
                  area or neighborhood, land
                  cannot immigrate to meet the higher demand.&nbsp; It is true that land
                  elsewhere can be converted to the specific land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">use </span>that is
                  demanded.&nbsp; Some micro theorists argue that this makes land as
"mobile" as anything else, equating land and
                  capital.&nbsp; It dovetails with and reinforces their paradigm centered
                  on
"the firm," a unit that can add unlimited inputs of all kinds
                  in the long run, and among which competition drives all profits to
                  zero.&nbsp; This rationalization overlooks the hoary adage of real
                  estate: "value depends on three factors, location, location, and
                  location." What happens then is<b> </b>not that supply rises to meet
          higher demand, but ground rent rises.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Land is not convertible into capital, nor <i>vice versa.&nbsp;
          </i>Exchange of land for capital has misled many into equating them,
                  but
                  only through inadvertence and the fallacy of composition.&nbsp;
          Exchange
                  is not interchange: exchange does not change the quantity of either
                  land
                  or capital.&nbsp; Capital is convertible into any other form of capital
                  each time it turns over, by using Capital Consumption Allowances, the
                  proceedings of turnover, to hire people actually to produce new
                  capital.&nbsp; Capital may also be disinvested and consumed, or
                  augmented
                  by new saving and investment.&nbsp; None of those is true of
          land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Land is indispensable to life, hence to economic activity.&nbsp;
          The
                  same
                  is generally true of labor and capital, but less
"absolutely".&nbsp; Land can exist perfectly well without
                  labor or capital, and support timber and wildlife, but labor and
                  capital cannot exist at all without at least some land, and often a
                  great
                  deal of land.&nbsp; Substitution is limited.&nbsp; It will not do just
                  to
                  have 57 varieties of labor, or of capital.&nbsp; There must be at least
                  some land.&nbsp; Remember, land includes space itself, and a time-slot
                  in
                  it.&nbsp; It includes air and water, the environment and the ecology
                  and
                  all original matter itself.&nbsp; Without land there is nothing.<small><span

          Coupling&nbsp; this with the non-reproduceability of land, and its

    <div align="left"><small>"Homelessness," a modem plague,
    is essentially
    landlessness.&nbsp; A popular ditty from the 1930s includes the catchy
    line, "If you can't pay the rent, you can live in a tent," but
    you can't do even that without a campsite.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why
    modern economists have so little to say about homelessness.&nbsp;
    Joblessness they have dismissed as part of the vital economic function
    of
"job-seeking," with which they have persuaded at least
    themselves.&nbsp; The next logical step is that the person sleeping in
    the doorway is not really homeless, but just engaged in the vital
    market
    function of "home-seeking".&nbsp; Rather than seem totally
    absurd they are simply silent, except to stress the "exclusionary
    principle" of private property as the bedrock of their system, and
    their system as a panacea. ... </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Land is traditionally subject to a host
    of legal and customary
    limits on use and ownership.&nbsp; Covenants are found in land titles:
    seldom in titles to cars or canned goods.&nbsp; Divided ownership is
    common, there is so much about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
    easements through, air rights over, mineral
    rights under, and neighbors and zoning all around any parcel of
    land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is unavoidably a social process, there
    is
    no other way.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>A large share of the more valuable land in cities is held by
    estates.&nbsp; Public and eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are
    preferentially tax
    exempt and often without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water
    licenses are held subject to "use it or lose it" traditions
    leading to appalling waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting licenses are
    highly political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with the
    characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of
    non-economic pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Amassing land is always done, can only be
    done, by shrinking the
    holdings of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to
    have
    more then B, C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other
    way.&nbsp; A can amass more capital by saving, creating new capital,
    leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with as much as before.&nbsp; A can
    increase his labor income by working longer, or harder, or smarter,
    producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He and she
    together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is
    reproducible, and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land,
    however, means just one thing: bumping others.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by
    all
    with
    no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or
    Beethoven, or understanding physics is any less because at the same
    time
    millions of others have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and
    science
    are the common property of mankind, open to all who care to acquire
    them.&nbsp; The
    creative producer's pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom
    he
    shares.&nbsp; The gratification is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp; The
    contrast with landholding is nearly total.<small><span

  <small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not,
  therefore,
  a
  threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
  or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with
  others' doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a
  particular limited market, but glutting one market increases real
  demand
  for the products of other markets, and raises the real value of others'
  incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing land, however, has to
  deprive
  others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated holding and
  control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
  of
  those left out.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can
  get
  land
  is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced
  as the solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is
  mere temporizing because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and
  demand grow, land rents rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the
  problem is not production, but distribution".&nbsp; There is no

</div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
  It may seem odd that both "capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
  justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
  (Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
  a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
  universal standard of justice
  upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
  The answer lies in clarifying the question of the rightful basis (if
  there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
  free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
  community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
  self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
  environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
  regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
  social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
  enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
  of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
  private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
  lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
  denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
  For Henry George, however, the principle was clear. The value of
  natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
  production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
  unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
  question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
  the
  community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
  go to the
  community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>
  In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character of
  natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
  coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
  rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
  life.</small>

<div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
  Beneath all ideologies, there are basic factors and relationships that
  underlie economic behavior. To understand the (otherwise inexplicable)
  omission of attention to land's economic importance, it is useful to go
  back to these basics.</small></div>
<div align="left">
  <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The term "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land</span>" refers to the whole
        material universe, exclusive of people and their products. </span>Not
        the creation of human labor, yet essential to labor, it is the raw
        material from which all wealth is fashioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It includes not only soil and minerals, but
        water, air, natural vegetation and wildlife, and all natural
        opportunities -- even those yet to be discovered.</span> It is a
        passive factor of production, yielding wealth only when labor is
        applied to it.</small></li>
        <li><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Labor </span>includes
        all human powers, mental and physical, used
        directly or indirectly to produce goods or to render service in
        exchange. Labor is often thought of as work that is done for hire, at
        fixed wages, mainly excluded from the risk-taking and decision-making
        that is normally classed under the heading of "entrepreneurship". Yet
        labor, properly understood, includes all human exertion in production
        -- including mental exertion. The payment to labor is called <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Wages</span>. And
        it is important to remember that the payment, or return, to labor does
        not include any returns that are the result of monopoly.</small></li>
        <li><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Capital </span>is
        the economic term that is most profoundly misunderstood
        and confused. For the term to make sense in any systematic analysis of
        wealth distribution, we must define capital in its classical sense as "wealth which is used to aid in further production, instead of being
        directly consumed." Since production is not completed until the product
        is in the hands of the consumer, products on their way to market, or
"wealth in the course of exchange," are also considered capital.</small></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now,
  the objective of all economic
  behavior is the satisfaction of human desires. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Human beings always seek to
  satisfy their desires with the least exertion</span>: this self-evident
  proposition lies at the heart of our concepts of economic value and
  exchange. </span>The primary thing needed for satisfaction is, of
  course, the tangible things, made from natural resources, that satisfy
  human desires and have exchange value. Things that meet these four
  fundamental criteria are termed "wealth". But money, bonds, and
  mortgages are but claims upon and measures of this value; they are not
  the wealth they symbolize.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A clear understanding of these basic definitions points
  immediately to
  the primacy of land as an economic factor. Human beings have
  inescapable material needs of food, clothing and shelter. Regardless of
  how long a chain of exchanges they may pass through in a modern
  economy, these things ultimately have their source in the land; they
  can come from nowhere else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Human
  beings need land in order to live. But if we must pay rent to a private
  land "owner" for access to the gifts of nature, it amounts to being
  charged a fee for our very right to live. </span><a

<div align="left">  Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
  Henry George</a></div>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George is largely remembered for
  the single tax. But the single
  tax came at the end of a long trail as a means -- <i>the</i> means,
  he said -- by which to remedy ills previously identified and
  diagnosed. Behind the single tax lay a closely knit system of
  thought. To understand George, it is necessary to go behind the
  single tax and explore that system for its major characteristics.
</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notable in George's work is the
  emphasis he laid on the relation
  of man to the earth. "The most important of all the material
  relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George might well be called a land
  economist, indeed, the foremost
  land economist. For George, the basic fact of man's physical
  existence is that he is a land animal, "who can live only on and from
  land, and can use other elements, such as air, sunshine and water,
  only by the use of land."&nbsp; "Without either of
  the three elements, land, air and water, man could not exist; but he
  is peculiarly a land animal, living on its surface, and drawing from
  it his supplies."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So man not only lives off land,
  levying on it for its materials
  and forces, but he also lives on land. His very life depends on land.
". ..land is the habitation of man, the store-house upon which he
  must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be
  applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products of
  the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the
  forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
  On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again -
  children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower
  of the field. Take away from man all that belongs to land, and he is
  but a disembodied spirit."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land and man, in that order! These
  two things are the
  fundamentals. They are, for instance, the fundamentals of production.
  It is said that without labor, certainly, there can be no production.
  Similarly, without land, clearly there can be no agricultural
  production or mining production. It was just as clear to George that
  there could be no production of any kind without land. There could be
  no factory production, no trade, no services rendered, and none of
  the multitudinous operations of town and city. </small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All these processes require land:
  a place, a spot, a site, a
  location, so many acres or square feet of the earth's surface on
  which to be performed. "In every form ...the exertion of human labor
  in the production of wealth requires space; not merely standing or
  resting space, but moving space -- space for the movements of the
  human body and its organs, space for the storage and changing in
  place of materials and tools and products. This is as true of the
  tailor, the carpenter, the machinist, the merchant or the clerk, as
  of the farmer or stock-grower, or of the fisherman or miner."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The office building, the store,
  the bank, as well as the factory,
  need land just as do the farm and mine. Land is needed as sites on
  which to build structures. Likewise, businesses need land as the
  locations on which to perform their subsequent operations. </small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George adds: "But it may be said,
  as I have often heard it said,
  'We do not all want land! We cannot all become farmers!' To this I
  reply that we do all want land, though it may be in different ways
  and in varying degrees. Without land no human being can live; without
  land no human occupation can be carried on. Agriculture is not the
  only use of land. It is only one of many. And just as the uppermost
  story of the tallest building rests upon land as truly as the lowest,
  so is the operative as truly a user of land as is the farmer. As all
  wealth is in the last analysis the resultant of land and labor, so is
  all production in the last analysis the expenditure of labor upon
  land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad needs land, not just
  for its terminals and depots but
  for its very roadbeds; whoever uses the railroad uses the land that
  the railroad occupies, as well as the improvements the railroad
  affords. The State needs land not only for parks and reservoirs but
  for schools and courts, for hospitals and prisons, and for roads and
  highways with which to link its residents together. </small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our homes require land, whether
  the home is a country estate, a
  city apartment, or a room in hotel or tenement. Our diversions
  require land, whether for a ride in the country, a round on the golf
  course, a seat at the theatre, or a chair in the library or before
  the television set. "Physically we are air-breathing, light-requiring
  land animals, who for our existence and all our production require
  place on the dry surface of our globe. And the fundamental perception
  of the concept land -- whether in the wider use of the word as that
  term of political economy signifying all that external nature offers
  to the use of man, or in the narrower sense which the word usually
  bears in common speech, where it signifies the solid surface of the
  earth -- is that of extension; that of affording standing-place or
  room." </small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In George's view, man's dependence
  on land is universal and
  endless, "...for land is the indispensible prerequisite to life."&nbsp;
"What is inexplicable, if we lose sight of
  man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we
  recognize it."</small></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here then is the main element,
  the distinctive characteristic, of
  George's work. In George's view, man's relation to the earth is his
  primary material relation. All other influences, therefore, must be
  appraised as to how they affect, or are affected by, this basic
  relation. It is perhaps this to which Soule refers when he says, of
  <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, "This book expounded a theory
  developed with superb logic."&nbsp;</small><small>
