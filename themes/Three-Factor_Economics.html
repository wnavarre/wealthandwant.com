      the production of Wealth. But it will have been no waste if it enables the
      reader to firmly grasp the fact. Nothing is more obvious, to be sure. Nothing
      is more readily assented to. Yet by layman and college professor and economic
      author alike, this simple truth is cast adrift at the very threshold of argument

        often fail to profit by it, that Capital is not a primary but a secondary
        requisite. See Jevons's Pol. Ec., secs. 16, 19.</font></p>

        wealth. . . Capital is not a necessary factor in production. Labor exerted

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ... </p>
  <p><strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
  <p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
    taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
    streams necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>
          2) upon our labor, or <br>
    3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
    of these parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is
    counted in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of
    capital (its liquid form) is in interest.</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of
    all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. To be sure many people have learned to position themselves in situations
    where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed these people
    come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</p>
  <p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
    principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. Land is classically taken
    to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space, in any
    medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
    the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms. One needs to return to 19th
    century classical economic definitions of the factors of production to appreciate
    the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.
    One should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical
    economic theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical
    economics. This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of
    academic economic history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one
    of the greatest, if very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>The starting point of the
      Georgist framework is rigorous definition of
      the three factors of production &#8212; land, labor, and capital, as in
      classical economics. It should be further pointed out that these
      factors are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all things of
      economic value. Something must necessarily be in one category or
      another; there is nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">outside </span>this
      total classification. Understanding of what constitutes labor differs
      little from definitions given elsewhere, regardless of which theory is
      used. But definitions of land and capital differ somewhat from common
      practice as well as sometimes in theory. Therefore, it is helpful to
      spend time explicating the definitions of each as they are used in
      Georgism, and to point out where these definitions diverge from those
      most often employed in neoclassical economics applications. Many
      contemporary economics texts begin by taking note of the
      land-labor-capital distinction, but then make little use of it later.
      These distinctions will make apparent why Georgist economics leads to
      very different explanations of economic phenomena as well as to
      different policy solutions.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Critical to an understanding of Georgist economics is its
      recognition
      of land as a special and unique factor of production. &#8220;Land,&#8221; to
      Georgists, as true for classical economists throughout the 19th
      century, is taken to mean not just the surface of the earth and
      locational space; it means also any and all those natural resources and
      non-human works that today can exact a market price. It includes the
      wealth of the earth in all its natural forms, the air and water as well
      as material elements. It includes phenomena of value like the
      electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit communications signals, and
      landing time slots such as have value at airports. As the world
      economies enter a new age of high technology, these radio spectrums and
      time allotments have gained ever increasing value. So also with
      geosychronous satellite
      orbits and most recently the genetic codes of all the biota on earth.<small><span

  <p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech)</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago classical
      economic thought still regarded land for the most part as the common heritage
      of mankind. From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and
      finally with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a function
      of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John Locke also
      accepted these premises. To achieve optimal economic productivity, one
      had to exact the appropriate price from each of those factors. The price
      of labor was in wages; the price of capital was interest; and the price
      of land, particularly following the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent.
      Rent in its classical sense means payment for the use of something in fixed
      supply, or, more generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
      Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted if
      the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we shall
      see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not seeing
      any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent economics
      profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to regard land as a
      separate factor and to redefine the terms of production instead in two-factor
      theory. This was concurrent with the inclusion of land as property, since
      called "real property." </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped under title
  in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be regarded as a private
  financial asset. Earlier it was regarded as part of nature, much like air,
  water, wind and weather. Accounting practices now listed land as an asset "owned" in
  fee simple, and as a liability on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to
  banks. This tendency has been extended today so that we have privatized much
  of our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came to be simply one kind
  of capital, nothing special, nothing requiring further treatment. Ricardo's
  Law of Rent became an artifact of intellectual history. The conflation of land
  into capital to create two-factor economics is one of the greatest paradigm
  shifts in the evolution of social philosophy. How the premises and terms of
  economic discourse have been changed has been documented for the first time
  in a new book by a California professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The account
  is put forth in fascinating detail entitled, <b><i><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
  Corruption of Economics</a>.</i></b> It was indeed a corruption of a discipline,
  a deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an interest in seeing
  such definitions changed, and we have all been paying the price since that
  time. This revealing thesis is what I really want to relate to you, and to
  explain the dire consequences it has had for us in our contemporary world.
  I have come to believe it; it makes sense to me, both historically and in contemporary
  analysis, from several perspectives.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>The Corruption of Economics</b> </small><br>
  <small>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of thinkers
  known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the 18th century. There
  ultimately evolved three major schools of economic thought a century later,
  one the continuing tradition of Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, a second being
  the aggressive and emerging school of Marxism, and the third a proposal for
  two-factor economics being pressed largely by interests in America. Marxism
  was never a major force in United States; the primary challenge to the classical
  tradition came from what has since come to be known as neo-classical economics.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the first time
      shown how powerful economic interests in American society essentially bought
      the leading figures of the newly- established American Economics Association
      with all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
      Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that special
      interests would be advantaged. What were those interests? Primarily the
      railroad industry, which at the time was probably the most powerful political
      force in America. By changing definitions and conflating the land factor
      into capital, it was no longer essential for land rent to be paid in taxes,
      and the railroads, holders of some of the most valuable land in the nation,
      were thereby able to escape their full duty. This is an astonishing story,
      one never fully spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
      community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the social
      problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of economic thought
      was ably synthesized and represented by one dominant figure of the age:
      Henry George. All but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the
      assiduous disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was
      more widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
      His 1879 book, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>,
      sold more copies throughout the world than any book till that time except
      the Bible. Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books,
      he traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a journalist.
      But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation of labor soon
      led him to study the classical economists and to write his ideas down.
      Upon publication of his book he shortly became known throughout the world,
      and traveled and lectured widely as a social reformer for the rest of his
      life. By the time he died he had become so famous that he almost won the
      mayoralty of the city of New York. He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall
      the first time in what was probably a corrupt election (but beating the
      third-place finisher, Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before
      a second election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
      lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies made
      more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows that it
      was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant interests
      in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and he was.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the definition
      of capital grew out of labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional
      definition, was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land
      was its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
      be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising from
      social improvements fell to speculators rather than being returned to society
      in rent. The failure of society to recapture the appropriate level of land
      rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the margin,
      creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could
      be relieved. Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
      George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its social
      activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have done to it.
      He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
      reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last when
      their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a right to a
      return on what it had brought about, as well as from the fact that those
      titles could never be other than leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused
      by use of the words "single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to
      society.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad barons of the 19th century
      were not just coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds
      on the founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
      some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White, Daniel
      Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas Murray Butler
      were all as attached to various universities in the country as they were
      to powerful railroad interests. They were able, through their control of
      universities either as actual presidents or as benefactors, to influence
      the dominant figures responsible for establishing the American Economic
      Association in 1885. The actual intrigue is too complex to be recounted
      here: who got appointed and promoted, who was funded in research, which
      were given endowed chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation
      with defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
      of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President of
        MIT and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
    <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of economics
        at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
        own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
    <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia University,
        and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
        then Smith College.</small></li>
    <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at Columbia
        University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the honored
      founders of an esteemed profession. So great was their victory over rival
      schools of thought that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear
      thinking and virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten.
      The lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
      from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman, Harberger
      and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed, when Henry George
      ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against the wealthy patrician
      Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who had recently recruited
      Clark to come to Columbia. To really understand the academic tension of
      the period, one must look at the published papers, the speeches and debates,
      the newspaper articles, and the citations at the end of those articles.
      These, even more than the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments,
      explain how much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for
      the falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
      have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather, it
      was the threat George represented to powerful interests that required him
      to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but only in the short
      run, as they were within decades victims of their very successes. Today
      we see that the railroads have failed in this country for lack of traffic.
      It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be made for
      the classical tradition, the result of which would be to rely upon payment
      of rent of land according to its value to society. George recognized that
      land value is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in
      any general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder
      to reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out that,
      from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the following
      virtues:</small></p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free markets
        and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the industrial
        society took hold.</small></li>
    <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising taxes
        on capital.</small></li>
    <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a progressive
        tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
        the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
        different land-use options.</small></li>
    <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or population
        settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
        discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
    <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government revenue
        without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
    <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time promotes
        economy in government.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still persistently
      hold to the view that there is something special about land that make it
      unwise to treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent
      a small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
      are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two-factor
        economics, however, had advantages to influential individuals and special
        interests</span>. Land speculators who were positioned to profit from
        knowing where locational values would increase, or were in a position
        to cause those increases, could quickly and easily reap a private gain.
        Simply by holding title to parcels of real property, without doing anything
        at all to increase their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This
        is because the increment of unearned increases resulting from social
        investments were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society.
        In <strong>three-factor economics</strong>, land rent reverted to society
        in an automatic and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George
        Leland Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
        Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then needed
        to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him a return
        on that which was made more valuable by his investment in the line. All
        across America, land speculators learned that capturing monopoly titles
        to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily turn a "profit" on
        their investment yet hardly raising a finger.... <a

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>The premises of discourse</strong></p>
    <p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary
        economics starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production
        in the creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive
        and, taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value.
        The first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called
        land. Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied;
        it meant not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth.
        Today sunlight, radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added.
        The second factor of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort
        applied by people's minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product
        of past application of land and labor to current production: capital. Each
        factor in classical economics has its price, the product of which is the
        creation of wealth as we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages;
        the price of capital is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as
        understood in economics, is not payment for the use of property owned by
        others; it has, rather, a more technical meaning, one which will require
        greater explication below.</p>
    <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
        and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge
      of taxation with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning
      to these
        fundamental building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible.
        Labor continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed
      in the course of a shift from classical to neoclassical economic thought.
      But capital,
        which had earlier encompassed only those creations that were the result
      of human enterprise&#8212; the product of labor and land, has now been
      redefined to include land. Land by itself in contemporary neoclassical
      economics has
        dropped out of the equation altogether, and so for the most part has
      the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
        formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
    <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and
          rent as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent
        is the surplus produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the
        necessary
          revenue to easily support public services, if it were only collected
        in the form of taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In
        fact, by shifting taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance
          of markets would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless
          to taxpayers. This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now
        possible
          to demonstrate with the advent of computer power and available data.
        It amplifies and validates what has been for a century only a plausible
        theoretical claim.
          We can now show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the
        services demanded of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base
        that exceeds
          all others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And unlike
          other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive. Economic
          rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates through
          the markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
          result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price.
          Economic rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason,
          and comes
          about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by the
          consequence rather of society's collective effort. British political
          economist David
          Ricardo first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to
          agricultural production in the early 1800s, but its applicability today
          is understood
          far more easily with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas ground
          rent to Ricardo reflected the differential gifts of nature inherent in
          various land sites, it is today better understood as reflective of locational
          differentials
          in the capacities of communities. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
