      <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense
          of Taxation</a> (1881 article)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>IT may seem like a truism to assert that the only fund upon which
          taxation can draw is that made up by the produce of the community,
          and that to multiply the places at which it is tapped is not to increase
          its capacity to yield. Yet the manner in which taxation, under our
          system, is spread over a multitude of subjects, and new subjects are
          still sought for, suggests the belief of that chief of the eunuchs
          who thought the weight of an obnoxious poll-tax might be lessened,
          and his master's revenues at the same time increased, by substituting
          for the tax on heads a tax upon fingers and toes.</p>
        <p>But it is probable that the disposition to tax everything susceptible
          of taxation does not spring so much from the notion that more may thus
          be obtained, as from the notion that as a matter of justice everything
          should be taxed. That all species of property shall be equally taxed,
          is enjoined by many of our State constitutions, and that it should
          be so, at least so far as direct taxation is concerned, is regarded
          by most of our people as a self-evident truth &#8212; the idea being
          that every one should contribute to public expenses in proportion to
          his means, or, as it is sometimes phrased, that all property, being
          equally protected by the State, should equally contribute to the expenses
          of the State.</p>
        <p>But under no system that any of our legislatures have yet been able
          to devise is all property equally taxed; nor can it be equally taxed.
          And if it were possible to even approximate to the equal taxation of
          all property, this would not be to secure that equality which justice
          demands. For, as is evident in the case of mortgages, etc., to equally
          tax all property would infallibly be to levy a higher rate of taxation
          upon some than upon others; and even if the same proportion could be
          taken from the means of every member of the community, that would no
          more conform to the dictates of equality than would the levy upon each
          of an equal sum; for, as the demand for a sum which would not be felt
          by the rich man would fall with crushing weight on the poor man, so
          to take the same proportion of their means would be a very different
          thing to him who has barely enough, and to him who has a large surplus.
          <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
        <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation,
          the method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored
          by fastening to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried
          in a buggy behind him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy
          by the bad stowage of a cargo which properly placed would make her
          the stiffer and more weatherly. So enterprise may be palsied, industry
          crushed, accumulation prevented, and a prosperous country turned into
          a desert, by taxation which rightly levied would hardly be felt.</p>
        <p>Now discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to
          equally tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the
          true rule, that taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion
          of the general prosperity, the securing of substantial equality, and
          the recognition of inalienable rights, let us consider upon what species
          of property it may be best laid. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
        <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
          The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes.
          It does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with
          the utmost ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs
          of production; and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality
          and the highest justice. For, to take for the common purposes of the
          community that value which results from the growth of the community,
          and to free industry and enterprise and thrift from burden and restraint,
          is to leave to each that which he fairly earns, and to assert the first
          and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the equal right of all
          to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
        <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest
          production is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution,
          and that in the proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility
          of enormously increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these
          pressing social and political problems which spring from unnatural
          inequality in the distribution of wealth.</p>
        <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work
          in which he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere
          recognized a most vital distinction between property in land and property
          which results from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one
          system which is the best; it is not that system which always exists,
          otherwise why should we desire to change it; but it is that system
          which should exist for the greatest good of humanity. God knows it,
          and wills it; man's duty it is to discover and establish it.&quot; <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

          <p>Taxes are either direct or indirect; or, as they have been aptly
            described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
            taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself

                which is demanded from the very persons who, it is intended or desired,

                . . Indirect taxes on the other hand are those which are levied on

                article of luxury or convenience.&quot; &#8212; Thompson's Pol.
                Ec., sec. 175.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their
            tendency to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall.
            Their magnitude and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for
            this reason that a great French economist of the last century denounced
            them as &quot;a scheme for so plucking geese as to get the most feathers
            with the least squawking.&quot;7</p>
          <blockquote>

                Taxation, p. 64.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">7. Though his language was blunt, the sentiment
                does not essentially differ from that of &quot;statesmen&quot; of
                our day who meet all the moral and economic objections to indirect
                taxation with
                the one
                reply that the people would not consent to pay enough or the
                support of government if public revenues were collected from
                them directly.
                This means nothing but that the people are actually hoodwinked
                by indirect taxation into sustaining a government that they would
                not
                support if they knew it was maintained at their expense; and
                instead of being a reason for continuing indirect taxation, would,
                if true,
                be one of the strongest of reasons for abolishing it. It is consistent

          <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
                                    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed
                                    commodities pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8
                                    and partly on account of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9
                                    it favors corruption in government by concealing from the people
                                    the fact that they contribute to the support of government; and it
                                    tends, by obstructing production, to crush legitimate industry and
                                    establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are of vastly more
                                    concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
          <blockquote>
                <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers,
                    enters into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate
                    of profit upon that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers.
                    The tax and the manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part
                    of the wholesale price and are collected from retailers. The retailers
                    in turn collect the tax with all intermediate profits upon it, together
                    with their :usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final purchasers
                    -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface to be
                    a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an indirect
                    tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of profits upon
                the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output
                    were imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather
                    the amount of the tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like
                    investment, and collect the whole, together with the cost of hides,
                    of transportation, of tanning and of selling, from shoe manufacturers,
                    who would collect with their profit from retailers, who would collect
                    with their profit from shoe consumers. The principle applies also
                    when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or
                    the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual
                    profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
                interest and discounts.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output
                    of manufacturers or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing
                    profit,
                  cost wholesalers $110,000; at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers
                  it
                    would cost retailers $121,000, and at 20 percent profit to retailers
                    it would finally impose a tax burden of $145,200 &#8212; being
                    45 per cent more than the government would get. Upon most commodities
                    the number of profits exceeds three, so that indirect taxes may
                    frequently
                    cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed only upon what
                    are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed upon materials
                    also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent
                    in addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of
                taxation.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect
                    taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When
                    shoe manufacturers, or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices,
                    or bankers add them to interest, it is not because they might do
                    otherwise but choose to do this; it is because the exigencies of
                    trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other tradesmen
                    who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
                    goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business.
                    It follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase
                    the price of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men,
                    which they must pay as a condition of doing their business, is as
                    truly part of the cost of their output as is the price of the materials
                    they buy or the wages of the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax
                    upon business men tends to increase the price of their products.
                    And this tendency is more or less marked as the tax is more or less
                great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized
                    products, such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented
                    articles and
                  copyright
                    publications is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly
                    manufacturer whose prices are not checked by cost of production,
                    and are therefore as a rule higher than competitive prices would
                    be, may find it more profitable to bear the burden of a tax that
                    leaves him some profit, by preserving his entire custom, than
                  to drive off part of his custom by adding the tax to his usual
                  prices.
                    This is true also of a moderate import tax to the extent it falls
                    upon goods that are more cheaply transported from the place of
                  production to a foreign market where the import tax is imposed
                  than to a home
                    market where the goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products,
                    for instance, of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far
                    away from any Canadian town. If the tax be less than the difference
                    in the cost of transportation the producer will bear the burden of
                    it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate effect would be a reduction
                    in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which may be cited in
                    opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect, will
                    upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
                cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>

          <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of
            indirect taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that
            is to make a great stride toward accepting the single tax. For the
            single tax is a form of direct taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">11. This is usually a stumbling block to those who, without much
                experience in economic thought, consider the single tax for the first
                time. As soon as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities
                shift to consumers they jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes
                upon land values would shift to the users. But this is a mistake,
                and the explanation is simple. Taxes upon what men produce make production
                more difficult and so tend toward scarcity in the supply, which stimulates
                prices; but taxes upon land, provided the taxes be levied in proportion
                to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning market supply of
                course), because they make it more difficult to hold valuable land
                idle, and so depress prices.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person who actually
                pays it to some other person varies with the object taxed. A tax
                on rents cannot be transferred. A tax on commodities is always transferred
                to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; Thorold Rogers's Pol. Ec., ch.

            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor,
                the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord

                Smith's Wealth of Nations, book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production
                and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human production,
                and taxes upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though a tax
                upon rent compels land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power
                to obtain more for the use of their land, as it in no way tends to
                reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling those who
                hold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a
                tax on land values tends to increase the competition between owners,
                and thus to reduce the price of land.&quot; &#8212; Progress
                and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. i.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting the tax
                in higher rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of shifting
                it to the consumers of goods in higher prices. The principle is the
                same. Merchants cannot charge higher prices for goods than their
                competitors do, merely because they pay higher ground rents. A country
                storekeeper whose business lot is worth but few dollars charges as
                much for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer whose lot is worth
                thousands. Quality for quality and quantity for quantity, goods sell
                for about the same price everywhere. Differences in price are altogether
                in favor of places where land has a high value. This is due to the
                fact that the cost of getting goods to places of low land value,
                distant villages for example, is greater than to centers, which are
                places of high land value. Sometimes it is true that prices for some
                things are higher where land values are high. Tiffany's goods, for
                instance, may be more expensive than goods of the same quality at
                a store on a less expensive site. But that is not due to the higher
                land value; it is because the dealer has a reputation for technical
                knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad among rich people), for
                which his customers are willing to pay whether his store is on a
                high priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">Though land value has no effect upon the price
                of good, it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in
                others. Therefore,
              though
                the price and the profit of each sale be the same, or even less,
                in good locations than in poorer ones, aggregate receipts and
              aggregate profits are much greater at the good location. And it
              is out of his
                aggregate, and not out of each profit, that rent is paid, For
              example: A cigar store on a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality
              of cigar
                for fifteen cents. On a side street the same quality of cigar
              can be bought no cheaper. Indeed, the cigars there are likely to
              be poorer,
                and therefore really dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare
                is very high compared with ground rent on the sidestreet. How,
              then, can the first dealer, he who pays the high ground rent, afford
              to
                sell as good or better cigars for fifteen cents than his competitor
                of the low priced location? Simply because he is able to make
              so many more sales with a given outlay of labor and capital in
              a given
                time that his aggregate profit is greater. This is due to the
              advantage of his location, and for that advantage he pays a premium
              in higher
                ground rent. But that premium is not charged to smokers; the
              competing dealer of the side street protects them. It represents
              the greater
                ease, the lower cost, of doing a given volume of business upon
              the site for which it is paid; add if the state should take any
              of it,
                even the whole of it, in taxation, the loss would be finally
              borne by the owner of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by
                the landlord. Any attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would
              be promptly checked by the competition of neighboring but cheaper
              land.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land-tax, levied in proportion to the

                and as such a tax will not apply to that land which yields no
                rent, nor to the produce of that capital which is employed on
                the land
                with a view to profit merely, and which never pays rent; it will

3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</strong><br />
<br />
To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and now,
in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in proportion
to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government must use
land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government is poor
to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits of good
government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many and fully
enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government are available,
or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest and most
available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would work or live
where the benefits of government are available, and does not already own land
there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other things
being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that the site
he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service of government
in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public which provides
the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of
                poor government than in any country of better government, other
                things being equal. They are lower in cities of poor government,
                other things being equal, than in cities of better government.
                Land values are lower, for example, in Juarez, on the Mexican
                side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad, than in El Paso,
                the neighboring city on the American side, where government is
                better. They are lower in the same city under bad government
                than under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform
                campaign, was elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced
                before he took the oath of office, upon the bare expectation
                that he would eradicate municipal abuses. Let the city authorities
                anywhere pave a street, put water through it and sewer it, or
                do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood rise in
                value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
                wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent
                land has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public
                improvements might be collected in abundance. Every man must
                be able to recall some within his own experience.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should
                be so. Land and not other property must rise in value with desired
                improvements in government, because, while any tendency on the
                part of other kinds of property to rise in value is checked by
                greater production, land can not be reproduced.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and
                property are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be
                either a very bold man or a very avaricious one who will build
                a store in such a community and stock it with goods; but suppose
                such a man should appear. His store costs him more than the same
                building would cost in a civilized community; mechanics are not
                plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to get. The
                building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
                about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak,
                because there are few men who will take the chances he has taken,
                and he charges all that his customers will pay. A hundred per
                cent, five hundred per cent, perhaps one or two thousand per
                cent profit rewards him for his pains and risk. His goods are
                dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough to satisfy the most
                contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should wish to
                buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
                the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This
                is the type of community in which may be found that land, so
                often mentioned and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually
                can't give away, you know!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient
                administration of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and
                life and property are safe. What about prices then? It would
                no longer require a bold or desperately avaricious man to engage
                in selling goods in that community, and competition would set
                in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
                cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
                Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty,
                and stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
                in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus
            able to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their
            common government points to the true method of taxation. With the
            exception of such other monopoly property as is analogous to land
            titles, and which in the purview of the single tax is included with
            land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the only kind of property
            that is increased in value by government; and the increase of value
            is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service which
            its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land
            in proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred
            monopolies excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single
            tax &#8212; we should be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not
                usually thought of as land titles, but that is what they are.
                By an act of sovereign authority they confer rights of control
                for transportation purposes over narrow strips of land between
                terminals and along trading points. The value of this right of
                way is a land value.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the
                value of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools,
                courts, police and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled
                him to enjoy. The landlord would pay a tax proportioned to the
                pecuniary benefits conferred upon him by the public in raising
                and maintaining the value of his holding. And if occupant and
                owner were the same, he would pay directly according to the value
                of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both intangible
                and pecuniary.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of
            class taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land
            to raise against the single tax, when it is considered that under
            existing systems of taxation they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest
            and the most degraded classes in the community, besides paying land-owners
            for such public benefits as come their way, are compelled by indirect
            taxation to contribute to the support of government. But landowners
            as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts, and
            of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools
            and the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in
            common with the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet,
            though they go through the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings
            are of considerable value pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on
            all important occasions, they, in effect and considered as a class,
            pay no taxes, because government, by increasing the value of their
            land, enables them to recover back in higher rents and higher prices
            more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same tangible benefits
            of government that others do, many of them as individuals and all
            of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
            which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value
            of their property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government
            which its occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to
            discriminate against them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington
                were paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes,
                a Congressional Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee
                to Investigate Tax Assessments in the District of Columbia, composed
                of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman, Wadsworth, of New York,
                and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House of Representatives,
                May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out the fact that
                the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum rate
                of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
                thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually
                and potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that
                as land-owners they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this
                condition is peculiar to Washington let him make similar estimates
                for any progressive locality, and see if the land-owners there
                are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase
                in the capitalized value of land. If the land yields or will
                yield to its owner an income in the nature of actual or potential
                ground rent, then to the extent that this actual or possible
                income is dependent upon government the landlord is in effect
                exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays on account of
                his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him to that
                extent.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
                government and the other of inefficient government, but in all
                other respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of
                residence and find a suitable site in the town of good government.
                For simplicity of illustration let us suppose that the land there
                is not sold outright but is let upon ground rent. You meet the
                owner of the lot you have selected and ask him his terms. He
                replies:</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
                exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other
                town for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
                if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down;
                they have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will
                be 'held up' and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride
                out in the spring, your carriage will stick in the mud up to
                the hubs, and if you walk you may break your legs and will be
                lucky if you don t break your neck; they have no street pavements
                and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair. When the moon
                doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have no street
                lights. The water you need for your house you must get from a
                well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
                We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force
                in the world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity;
                our sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water
                system that equals that of New York; and in every way the public
                benefits in this town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed
                town in all this region. Isn't it worth a hundred and fifty dollars
                a year more for a building site here than over in that poorly
                governed town?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the
                terms. But when your house is built and the assessor visits you
                officially, what would be the conversation if your sense of the
                fitness of things were not warped by familiarity with false systems
                of taxation? Would it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
                the assessor. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
                your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
                for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent
                fire department? Are not you protected from robbery by the best
                police force in the world? Do not you have the use of macadamized
                pavements, and good sidewalks, and electric street lights, and
                a first class water supply? Don't you suppose these things cost
                something? And don't you think you ought to pay your share?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or less
                calmness; &quot;I do have the benefit of these things, and I
                do think that I ought to pay my share toward supporting them.
                But I have already paid my share for this year. I have paid it
                to the owner of this lot. He charges me two hundred and fifty
                dollars a year -- one hundred and fifty dollars more than I should
                pay or he could get but for those very benefits. <em>He</em> has
                collected my share of this year's expense of maintaining town
                improvements; you go and collect from him. If you do not, but
                insist upon collecting from me, I shall be paying twice for these
                things, once to him and once to you; and he won't be paying at
                all, but will be making money out of them, although he derives
                the same benefits from them in all other respects that I do.&quot;<br />

            Parts of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who
            Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of
            shifting, the distinction between land and improvements was opaque.
            This is a remarkable oversight, because improvements typically depreciate
            at the rate of 0.5 to 1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9
            And in view of the fact that assessments in New York localities have
            historically been very infrequent, one can understand how the land
            values are in reality a far higher proportion of parcel value than
            assessments would suggest.10 This means that in a period of seven
            years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
            by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to
            be illustrative. Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their
            rates of change during this time span; upstate New York was largely
            stable, but downstate localities experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
          <p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as<strong> the &#8220;new
            view&#8221; of property tax incidence</strong>, an acceptance of
            the idea that &quot;the burden of the tax on improvements
            remains with the owners of capital in the form of a lower net return
            instead of being
            shifted to users of property in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11
            Proponents point out that &#8220;the tax on improvements is essentially
            a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and therefore] its incidence will
            depend on the characteristics of supply and demand for capital nationally
            rather than on a single market.&#8221;12 The effect of this is to
            make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;13 Nonetheless, in
            a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with <strong>the &#8220;old
            view&#8221; </strong>in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate
            to assume that the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax
            burdens
            within one specific state (underlining in original). Thus, the old
            or traditional view was adhered to in the analysis. . ; that is,
            the excise effect of the tax was considered dominant.&#8221;14 The
            ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has over 1,300
            local assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their notice.

  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
  applied these inherent differences
  between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
  incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
  products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
  from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
  upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
  exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
  ...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
  finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
  building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
  tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
  from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
  upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
  government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
  of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
  production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
  supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
  land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
  the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
  land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
  speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
  values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
  reduce the price of land." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
