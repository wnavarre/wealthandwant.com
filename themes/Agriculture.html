You may see the same thing all over this country. See how injuriously
in the agricultural districts this thing of private property in land
affects the roads and the distances between the people. A man does not
take what land he wants, what he can use, but he takes all he can get,
and the consequence is that his next neighbour has to go further along,
people are separated from each other further than they ought to be, to
the increased difficulty of production, to the loss of neighbourhood
and companionship. They have more roads to maintain than they can
decently maintain; they must do more work to get the same result, and
life is in every way harder and drearier. ... <a

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the rudest social state,
while industry consists in
hunting, fishing, and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth,
private possession of land is not necessary. But as men begin to
cultivate the ground and expend their labor in Permanent works,
private possession of the land on which labor is thus expended is
needed to secure the right of Property in the products of labor. For
who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed to
enable him to reap? Who would attach costly works to the soil without
such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the
benefit?
</small><br>
<br>
<small>This right of private possession in things created by God is,
however, very different from the right of private ownership in things
produced by labor. The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in
cases when the dictate of self-preservation may terminate all other
rights. The purpose of the one, the exclusive possession of land, is
merely to secure the other, the exclusive ownership of the products of
labor; and it can never rightfully be carried so far as to impair or
deny this. While anyone may hold exclusive possession of land so far as
it does not interfere with the equal rights of others, he can
rightfully hold it no further. ...&nbsp;<a

      Land Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury
      in the Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

      Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
      Value Rating</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The three sources of land
rent, the gift of nature, public
services and community development, lead logically to the justice of
three distinct taxes on land.</b> The gift of nature is primarily the
agricultural value of land, but also the value of natural resources
and the extra value of land near rivers and harbors that arises
because such land represents good places to put cities whether or not
cities are presently there. This component of the rental value of
land should be collected <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">nationally </span>and
used to support a guaranteed
income for all citizens. The part of land value that arises from
public services is justly the income of the community that provides
those services. When private individuals and firms undertake
activities that raise the rental value of surrounding land, the value
thereby created should justly be awarded to those whose actions
create it. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>One activity that is sometimes thought to be unfairly
affected
by site value rating is farming. </b>To a substantial extent, this
concern reflects a misperception of the relation between urban and
rural rents. The vast preponderance of land rents are urban. Also, it
is important to remember that the basis of site value rating is the
unimproved value of land. Much of what farmers do increases the value
of land in ways less obvious than buildings. Site value rating of
agricultural land should be applied on the basis of what the rental
value of the land would be in a completely overgrown condition. But
there is an important element of validity in the argument of farmers
that they are treated unfairly by site value rating. When site value
rating is used to finance public services, farmers can justly say
that their land does not benefit from public services in the way that
urban land does. Indeed, it has been said above that public services
should be financed from the increase in land rents above their value
in the absence of economic development. Site value rating of
agricultural land, and of the pre-development value of urban land,
has as its basis the idea that provenance of nature is the common
heritage of all citizens. If we wish only to finance local public
services and to reward activities that increase surrounding land
rents, then the agricultural value of land, and the pre-development
value of urban land should be excluded from the tax base. These
should be taxed only when the nation is prepared to accept, and be
bound by the consequences of, the principle that the provenance of
nature is the common heritage of all citizens. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>A separate valuation process would be used to estimate the value
of all land in the nation in the absence of economic development.
These estimates would be checked by occasional auctions of unimproved
agricultural land far from cities. The results of this process would
be used to implement a redistribution of pre-development rent among
localities, based on the principle that predevelopment rent should be
shared on an equal per capita basis.&nbsp; ... <a

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actually increases
over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The depletion of natural
resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics" ... <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.
Agricultural benefits</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The application of LVT to
agricultural land, with the assessment being
based on "maximum sustainable yield," forces farmers to think long-term
and provides much-needed financial incentives for organic farming. That
is, farmers will be saddled with the same annual LVT dues whatever
their yield (in addition to climatic considerations in assessing LVT)
and will now have a powerful incentive to farm with a long-term
perspective. If, for example, the land is degraded and yields
consequently drop, then the financial consequences will properly be
borne by the farmer. This is merely the briefest of explanations of an
important adaptation of LVT, which calls for other measures such as the
requirement for any user of the Global Commons to pay an appropriate
Ecological Security Deposit and a transition period to allow farmers to
unhook themselves from the conventional chemical circuit.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small></small></div>
<small><small><br>
</small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The LVT assessment process
shifts and refines our focus from monitoring
human activity, onto our use and abuse of natural resources, as any
responsible form of stewardship should. The potential effect of such a
focus on everyday attitudes is inestimable.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The process of monitoring and assessing LVT itself leads to a
more
subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently, many
natural resources are almost assigned a worthless value because, not
entering the mainstream marketplace, they usually have no $ tags
hanging off them - hence the existence of externalities whereby the
environment is plundered as near worthless.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So
even wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>One way or another, it is necessary to quantify and prioritise
the real
value (in a broad sense) of natural resources to better account for
economic externalities. In the end, only if a prospective resource user
is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising land and other natural
resources will resource extraction or development go ahead. The
intrinsic nature of the LVT assessment process considerably assists in
such cost estimation.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT's foundation of detailed
land use
assessments will also help expose the true costs of subsidies for
natural resources, which effectively amount to negative eco-taxes.</span>
Subsidies come in all shapes and sizes, often barely visible, and
urgently need to be exposed and evaluated. Even some harmful subsidies
which are labeled land taxes have nothing to do with genuine LVT. Banks
gives the example of a Brazilian tax which was levied on unimproved
land but was reduced by up to 90% on land used for crops or pasture.
Forests were classified as unimproved land and were therefore taxed at
the full rate, which induced settlers to chop down the trees to reduce
their tax liability."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
major dynamic behind such
over-exploitation of parts of the environment is the process by which
hundreds of millions of people are displaced onto marginal land by
current tax-and-tenure systems. </span>In desperation they overwork
resources that ought to be carefully nurtured. Yet the practices of
such desperate peasants can be largely halted when the principles of
LVT are implemented and made clear. Daly makes the case that taking
away by taxation the value added by individuals from applying their own
labor and capital creates resentment but "taxing away value that no one
added, scarcity rents on nature's contribution, does not create
resentment. In fact, failing to tax away the scarcity rents to nature
and letting them accrue as unearned income to favored individuals has
long been a primary source of resentment and social conflict."<small><span

the result is "privilege," which from its Latin roots means
"<b>private law</b>," that is, law that permits one person to do what
others are not permitted to do. Thus <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">what we stand for is an end to
privilege.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Numerous examples of privilege are

institutions.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Farm legislation restricts the growing of tobacco to those
who have been assigned acreage allotments.</small></li>
  <li><small>For numerous commodities, trade legislation limits
shipments from individual countries to specified quotas.</small></li>
  <li><small>In many cities, only persons who have been given permits
are allowed to operate taxis, and new permits are not issued.</small></li>
  <li><small>To operate a radio or television station requires a
license, and there are no opportunities for new licenses to be issued.</small></li>
  <li><small>In most cities, construction of commercial or multi-family
residential structures requires zoning permission that is granted to
some and not to others.</small></li>
  <li><small>But the single most important category of privilege is
land titles.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This list of examples of
privilege, which is by no means
exhaustive, contains some privileges, such as acreage allotments and
import quotas, that would be best reformed by eliminating
restrictions and permitting all to do what now only some may do. For
other privileges, such as broadcast licenses and land titles, great
productivity results from the social understanding that a specified
individual will have the use of a given resource. For these
privileges, the best reform is the introduction of the requirement
that any person who is assigned such an opportunity must pay to the
public treasury an annual fee equal to what the opportunity would be
worth to someone else.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

function that can be either enhanced or degraded by the impact of
land taxes on land speculation. This paper discusses four types of
taxes on land: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>taxes on the rental value of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on the sale value of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on realized income from land, and </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on realized gains from the sale of land. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All four taxes reduce incentives
for speculation in land, which is
generally beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with
respect to incentives to develop land, while the first and second do
not. All four taxes have some beneficial effect of mitigating
imperfections in capital markets. All permit reduction or elimination
of taxes with significant dead-weight losses, such as those on
improvements.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Abstract from the continuous
divisibility of land
and suppose that land comes in "sites." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">At each moment in time, each
site is in one of three states:</span>
</small></p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>1. Suitable for agriculture. </small><br>
    <small>2. Suitable for housing.</small><br>
    <small> </small><small>3. Suitable for commercial activity.</small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While
each site can be used for any activity, the net return will
be greatest if it is used for the activity for which it is suited,
provided that it remains in that activity long enough to fully
amortize the associated capital that is state-specific, durable and
immobile. </span>What could keep a site from remaining in an activity
long
enough to amortize the associated capital is that from time to time a
site makes a transition from state 1 to state 2 or from state 2 to
state 3. These transitions are imperfectly predictable. When a
transition from state 2 to state 3 occurs unexpectedly, the course of
action that maximizes the net return to the site may entail scrapping
prematurely the residential structure built there and building a
commercial structure. In such an instance, one may be able to look
backward and say that it would have been better not to have built the
residential structure at all, but rather to have left the site in
agricultural use until the transition to state 3 occurred. However,
such reckoning can affect investment decisions only to the extent
that transitions can be foreseen.<strong> ...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<br>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
speculative return from foreseeing
future transitions arises
from holding title to land when pending transitions become generally
known. This return is a purely private return, with no corresponding
social return, since the land will increase in value whether or not
any given speculator holds it.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
land-management return from
foreseeing future transitions, on the other hand, arises from knowing
not to employ capital on sites where future transitions will cause
the capital to depreciate prematurely</span>. This is a social return,
since
it involves improving the allocation of scarce resources. There is no
necessary connection between the private return and the social
return. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html"><span

is that each position has important strengths as well as important

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>To bolster their local economies and fatten
their tax base, local governments compete to attract large new
employers. Hoping to recoup down the road when businesses pay full
property taxes, elected officials offer such inducements as five-year
abatements and low system development charges. Yet each locality must
outdo others' incentives. Enterprise zones and tax privileges amount to
major subsidies that would otherwise generate substantial tax revenues.<br>
<br>
Already, Washington, Oregon, and other states employ a nonregulatory
means to reward preservation of unbuilt-upon land. They assess farm and
resource lands at current use rather than at market value to avoid
pressuring owners to develop. However, as long as demand for land
persists, and the more central locations are not offered in the market,
then the temptation before farmers to sell out to developers also
persists. <strong>...</strong><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Another candidate for least
sustainable is factory <span style="font-weight: bold;">farming</span>.
What makes
mechani-chemical agribusiness financially feasible is the ability to
borrow against pumped up land values. Land dues end land's role as
collateral, leaving growers little choice but to entertain the organic
option. To ease the transition, the locality could disburse collected
rent to residents. Plus, untaxing labor makes it more affordable to
hire a helping hand. And, where cities are compacted, farms can stay
closer to local markets. As Italy discovered centuries ago, nearby open
space keeps fresh food -- whether grown, raised, gathered, or hunted --
readily available to satisfy the quality-sensitive urbanites. Further,
as city folk enjoy more open space and grow closer to nature, they
become a growing informed market, preferring local, organic, tasty, and
healthy produce.<b><br>
</b><br>
Applying the PTS to rural resources has the same conserving effect
as on urban land. Sites yielding resources most easily would be used
more intensely, forcing the abandonment of marginal sites. These sites
could then revert to other uses, such as outdoor recreation or, once
restored, natural habitat for other species. Here, too, the land
dividend helps former loggers and miners adjust and become guides and
foresters. Untaxing labor makes such new jobs more affordable to new
companies. Other labor-intensive enterprises could compete with the
capital-intensive ones. Recycling, which has the barest minimum of
overhead, would grow more profitable as virgin extraction grows less.
... </small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small><br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<b></b>Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public,
governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
</span>Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are
not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>... </strong></small></p>

poorer farmers who might try the less expensive organic methods. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on income makes labor more
expensive, especially at the margin, where youths entering the
workforce would seek jobs in recycling, reforestation, organic
agriculture, and deconstruction (what better outlet for male adolescent
energy). Having to pay wages plus taxes on income and for social
security, bosses, including farmers, employ fewer workers. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of processed food does

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If land and land rent are the
strongest determinants to Georgists,
energy is its closest counterpart to ecological economists. Just as
land rent can be measured fully in terms the relative surplus it
produces in any given socio-economic context, energy can be traced and
calculated in calories, BTU&#8217;s or joules. Land rent is completely a
human product &#8212; there is no rent where there are no people, as land has
no market value. On the other hand, energy exists regardless whether
people are present or not, as it is a component of nature itself. But
not all energy is now recognized as relevant in economics; only that
energy which is employed in the human economy, and we assume that the
human economy is necessarily bounded. Wind, sunlight and lightening are
as yet unpriced and are peripheral today even in ecological economics.
Attention is given more to those natural resources potentially
procurable or otherwise relevant to human dependency, and energy
certainly is primary. So rather than regard energy as a free good and
largely outside the economy&nbsp;as neoclassical
economics assumes, energy will likely continue to be central &#8212; even the
driving force &#8212; in ecological economics. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Indeed just about all other factors of production are
essentially
convertible from energy. Besides that used in households, industry, and
transportation sectors, agriculture &#8212; at least linked to developed
economies &#8212; is essentially energy driven. As Martinez-Alier has shown,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">86</span></small>
modern agriculture is essentially unfeasible without reliance upon
applied energy forms, and the diets of modern societies are heavily
reliant upon energy in the forms of intensive fertilizer use, intensive
application of machinery, and animal protein-fed farmers. By way of
contrast, in pre-modern agricultural societies one could argue that
human and animal energy account for all the foodstuffs produced, and
were used in turn to assure the continuance of the agricultural cycle.
Unlike modern societies they are in energy equilibrium. Hall<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">87</span></small>
argues that energy is the determining factor in the development success
of all economies, posing momentous challenges for the future as
projected shortages of fossil fuel sources loom on the horizon.... <a

farm counties are not,
generally, resource tax-enclaves
(except by comparison with poor farm counties).</span> The "rural"
counties
today with high values per head are resort counties, like Vilas and
Walworth in Wisconsin, with their prized lake frontages; or "exurban"
counties like Napa in California; or Berkshire in Massachusetts. In
California, you might think that fruitful farming counties like
Tulare have a lot more taxable real estate value per head than urban
ones. Such is a durable belief, but it is wrong. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Tulare County reports assessed values per head of $38,100.
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The whole state averages $60,000 per head. </small></li>
  <li><small>Suburban Marin County weighs in with $95,400; </small></li>
  <li><small>urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; </small></li>
  <li><small>Orange County has $74,000. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You might also think that Tulare,
being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The <b>Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</b> in Tulare County is 28%,
compared to a statewide mean of 40%, and 47% in Orange County. Grazing
and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. Counties with intensive
working farms, like those of the San Joaquin Valley, have low values
of LSREV. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Switching just the local property
tax to land ex buildings will do
little to correct such disparities. It will therefore make little
progress toward overall distributive justice, and the wide support
that would evoke. There is, in fact, a natural cap on local property
tax rates imposed by local particularism. The City Council of
Beverly Hills will not raise land taxes in Beverly Hills to help

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>5. "The cost of
water is passed through to consumers in higher prices"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! At last I'm in my own
field. Prices are determined by
supply and demand, not cost. If you sell in a national or world
market, or even a competitive local market, you are a price-taker,
not a price-maker. You can't pass cost hikes on to consumers; you
have to eat them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, water (like energy)
is an unusual kind of input whose
high price may actually increase production. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be easy to assume, using
the good old idea of diminishing
returns, that dearer water would reduce intensity of land use. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It certainly cuts water use, but
when you pay more for water you
often switch to higher-valued crops. That is what Southern California
farming is all about. You substitute capital and labor for water on
the same land, and often raise yields per acre. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You cannot afford to dump
high-priced water on barley, or alfalfa,
or rice, or irrigated pasture, or any other of these domesticated
phreatophytes that guzzle up most of our underpriced water today.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A number of fairways and
cemeteries would also give way to
higher-valued uses. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With dearer water you use less by
controlling it better, switching
from primitive furrow irrigation to sprinklers, spitters and drip.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This in turn lets you do new
things like growing avocados on steep
hillsides formerly barren, yielding more dollars of product for less
water (and in this case on waste land). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The above facts point to a
fascinating, portentous corollary:
you can tax water withdrawals without wrecking the water economy.
