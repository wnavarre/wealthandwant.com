  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1971 he sued the Assessor to
hurry up and deny preferential low tax valuations to private country
clubs that discriminate against Jews and other ethnic groups. In this
case, amazingly, the Calif. Supreme Court ruled the private country
clubs may continue to exclude Jews and others, while still enjoying
their low tax valuations. One of the most powerful Jewish communities
in the country might have taken the lead, but private Jewish country
clubs may also exclude gentiles, by inference. <span

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another objection sometimes
raised against site value rating is
that it would make leisure uses of land, such as golf courses,
impossibly expensive. There are two parts to the answer to this
objection. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, people who wish to devote land to golf courses do
not deserve special privileges and the expense of other members of
society. Any person or group that wishes to use land for a golf course
should be free to do so, provided that they are willing to compensate
the rest of society for the smaller amounts of land that will be
available to everyone else because they want a golf course. And the
rental value of the land that is used for the golf course measures what
is owed to the rest of society. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second part of the answer is that to the extent that
golf courses raise the value of surrounding land, it qualifies for
receipt of the increase in the rental value of surrounding land that
results from the use of the land as a golf course.... <a

Support of Environmentalism</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other worthy goals that conflict are open
    space and water conservation.</span> A major problem in an arid land is that
    much wide open space guzzles up water. Conserving open space and conserving
    water conflict directly. Green grass uses more water per acre than almost
    any farm crop except rice (and rice returns part of it downstream). In cities
    most water is used not for swimming pools or toilets or washing machines,
    but for sprinkling lawns. Cemeteries, golf courses, horse-pastures, parks,
    freeway banks, and the spacious tax-exempt grounds of institutions are the
    greatest water junkies outside of farming itself, which of course takes much
    more than all cities.</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Something
        has to give. Thus far it has been wetlands that gave. </span>Once, perhaps,
        we had too much wetland, but that was long ago. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We cannot accommodate all those uses, and
        save wetlands too, just by having restaurants stop serving water, or
        putting bricks in toilet tanks. Those are just token or "Goo-Goo" measures
        for parlor reformers; they distract us from real problems, and substitute
        for real solutions.
        What is the highest and best use of water? Wetlands, maybe; more golf
        courses, maybe not. But we need a rule to gauge "highest and best use." Is
        it the market? Read on. ... </span></div>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On what basis shall habitat-savers
        identify with median Americans?
        We share a problem: we are all victims of private property rights
        carried to extremes. Abraham Lincoln, the original Radical
        Republican, once spoke to the effect that whenever landless people
        cannot find work and shelter, then the rights of private property
        have been carried too far and must be curbed. We have seen what
    Gifford Pinchot said.</small></p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>"... natural resources
      must be developed and preserved
      for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
      the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
    the development of the country WHICH BELONGS TO US ALL." </i></small></blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Belongs to us all? Was Pinchot a
      Communist? Not likely: he was a
      Republican, an active political one, twice Governor of
    Pennsylvania.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have too little time together
      to develop that fully, but here
      are some ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">First,
      environmentalists might rethink what we mean
      by "open space." To Pinchot, "open" meant the space had public
      access. Today it often means the reverse: golf courses, duck clubs,
      sacred Indian lands, private beaches, cemeteries, farmlands, vacant
      speculative holdings, unpoliced parks taken over by gangs, protected
      and posted habitat, water from which swimmers are excluded for power
      boats, rights-of-way closed to hikers, University experimental plots,
      and so on.</span> In this sense, there is more open land in downtown
      Manhattan than in many of our rural and sylvan areas. Many a water
      reservoir is open to beavers, ducks and geese, who routinely powder
      their noses there, but not to humans who seldom do, and can be

  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><b>5. "The cost of
          water is passed through to consumers in higher prices"</b>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Wrong! At last I'm in my own field. Prices are determined by
      supply and demand, not cost. If you sell in a national or world
      market, or even a competitive local market, you are a price-taker,
      not a price-maker. You can't pass cost hikes on to consumers; you
      have to eat them. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">In addition, water (like energy) is an unusual kind of input whose
      high price may actually increase production. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">It would be easy to assume, using the good old idea of diminishing
      returns, that dearer water would reduce intensity of land use. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">It certainly cuts water use, but when you pay more for water you
      often switch to higher-valued crops. That is what Southern California
      farming is all about. You substitute capital and labor for water on
      the same land, and often raise yields per acre. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">You cannot afford to dump high-priced water on barley, or alfalfa,
      or rice, or irrigated pasture, or any other of these domesticated
      phreatophytes that guzzle up most of our underpriced water today.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">A number of fairways and cemeteries would also give way to
      higher-valued uses. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">With dearer water you use less by controlling it better, switching
      from primitive furrow irrigation to sprinklers, spitters and drip.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">This in turn lets you do new things like growing avocados on steep
      hillsides formerly barren, yielding more dollars of product for less
      water (and in this case on waste land). </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><b>The above facts point to a fascinating, portentous corollary:
      you can tax water withdrawals without wrecking the water economy.
    </b></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">On the contrary, such taxes (carefully crafted to be constructive)
      can encourage conservation, getting more bins and bales for the
      bucket, so to speak. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Americans are raised on anti-tax slogans masquerading as economic
      analysis, always presuming taxes destroy good incentives and wreck
      the economy. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Here is a kind of tax that raises revenue while strengthening the
      economy. </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">This corollary is too good to drop, and is highlighted later. ... <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_18F.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read
