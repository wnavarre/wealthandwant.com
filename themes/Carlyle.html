<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We call ourselves the "party of
principle," and we base property
rights on the principle that everyone is entitled to the fruits of
his labor. Land, however, is not the fruit of anyone's labor, and our
system of land tenure is based not on labor, but on decrees of
privilege issued from the state, called titles. In fact, the term
"real estate" is Middle English (originally French) for "royal
state." The "title" to land is the essence of the title of nobility,
and the root of noble privilege.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The royal free lunch</b>
</small><br>
<small>When the state granted land titles to a fraction of the
population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
or "free lunch" from the actual land users.</small></div>

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    13 Effect of Remedy Upon Social Ideals </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Part
    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; 4. Of the changes that would be wrought
    in social organization and social life</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread everything
      pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all the higher possibilities
      of life; which converts civility into a hollow pretense, patriotism into a
      sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which makes so much of civilized existence
      an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which the weapons are cunning and fraud?</p>
  <p>Does it not spring from the existence of want? <strong>Carlyle somewhere
      says that poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is most afraid.
      And he is
      right. Poverty is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath
      civilized society. </strong>And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when
      the wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest pain
      is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame, degradation;
      the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and mental nature as with
      hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses and the sweetest affections;
      the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You love your wife, you love your children;
      but would it not be easier to see them die than to see them reduced to the
      pinch of want in which large classes in every highly civilized community live?
      The strongest of animal passions is that with which we cling to life, but it
      is an everyday occurrence in civilized societies for men to put poison to their
      mouths or pistols to their heads from fear of poverty, and for one who does
      this there are probably a hundred who have the desire, but are restrained by
      instinctive shrinking, by religious considerations, or by family ties. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/13_Effect_upon_Ideals.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p><br>
  Thomas Carlyle, quoted by James Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
  Policy</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Mother-Earth</p>
  <p>&quot;The Land is <em>Mother</em> of us all; nourishes, shelters, gladdens,
    lovingly enriches us all; in how many ways, from our first wakening to our
    last sleep
      on her blessed mother-bosom, does she, as with blessed mother-arms, enfold
      us all! ... Properly speaking, the Land belongs to these two: to the Almighty
      God; and to all his Children of Men. &#8230;It is not the property of any generation,
      we say, but that of all the past generations that have worked on it, and of
      all the future ones that shall work on it.&quot; [Thomas Carlyle, Past
      and Present, iii, 8] </p>
  <p>A Landless Nation</p>
  <p>&quot;We hear it said, the soil of England, or of any country, is properly
    worth nothing, 'except the labour bestowed on it,' This, speaking even in the
    language of Eastcheap, is not correct. The rudest space of country equal in
    extent to England - could a whole English nation, with all their habitudes,
    arrangements, skills, with whatsoever they do carry within the skins of them
    and cannot be stript of, suddenly take wing and alight on it - would be worth
    a very considerable thing! . . . On the other hand, fancy what an English nation,
    once 'on the wing,' could have done with itself, had there been simply no soil,
    not even an inarable one, to alight on? Vain all its talents for ploughing,
    hammering, and whatever else; there is no Earth-room for this nation with its
    talents. &#8230;Soil, with or without ploughing, is the gift of God. The soil
    of all countries belongs evermore, in a very considerable degree, to the Almighty
    Maker! The last stroke of labour bestowed on it is not the making of its value,
    but only the increasing thereof.&quot; [Thomas Carlyle, Past and Present,
    iii, 8]</p>
