<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[01] </font>THE trees, as I write, have not yet begun to leaf,
  nor even the blossoms to appear; yet, passing down the lower part of Broadway
  these early days of
  spring, one breasts a steady current of uncouthly dressed men and women, carrying
  bundles and boxes and all manner of baggage. As the season advances, the human
  current will increase; even in winter it will not wholly cease its flow. <strong>It
  is the great gulf-stream of humanity which sets from Europe upon America &#8212; 
  the greatest migration of peoples since the world began.</strong> Other minor branches
  has the stream. Into Boston and Philadelphia, into Portland, Quebec and Montreal,
  into New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco and Victoria, come offshoots of
  the same current; and as it flows it draws increasing volume from wider sources.
  Emigration to America has, since 1848, reduced the population of Ireland by
  more than a third; but as Irish ability to feed the stream declines, English
  emigration increases; the German outpour becomes so vast as to assume the first
  proportions, and the millions of Italy, pressed by want as severe as that of
  Ireland, begin to turn to the emigrant ship as did the Irish. In Castle Garden
  one may see the garb and hear the speech of all European peoples. From the
  fiords of Norway, from the plains of Russia and Hungary, from the mountains
  of Wallachia, and from Mediterranean shores and islands, once the center of
  classic civilization, the great current is fed. Every year increases the facility
  of its flow. Year by year improvements in steam navigation are practically
  reducing the distance between the two continents; year by year European railroads
  are making it easier for interior populations to reach the seaboard, and the
  telegraph, the newspaper, the schoolmaster and the cheap post are lessening
  those objections of ignorance and sentiment to removal that are so strong with
  people long rooted in one place. Yet, in spite of this great exodus, the population
  of Europe, as a whole, is steadily increasing.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[02] </font>And across the continent, from east to west, from the older to the newer
  States, an even greater migration is going on. Our people emigrate more readily
  than those of Europe, and increasing as European immigration is, it is yet
  becoming a less and less important factor of our growth, as compared with the
  natural increase of our population. At Chicago and St. Paul, Omaha and Kansas
  City, the volume of the westward-moving current has increased, not diminished.
  From what, so short a time ago, was the new West of unbroken prairie and native
  forest, goes on, as children grow up, a constant migration to a newer West.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[03] </font>This westward expansion of population has gone on steadily since the
  first settlement of the Eastern shore. It has been the great distinguishing
  feature in the conditions of our people. Without its possibility we would have
  been in nothing what we are. Our higher standard of wages and of comfort and
  of average intelligence, our superior self-reliance, energy, inventiveness,
  adaptability and assimilative power, spring as directly from this possibility
  of expansion as does our unprecedented growth. All that we are proud of in
  national life and national character comes primarily from our background of
  unused land. We are but transplanted Europeans, and, for that matter mostly
  of the &quot;inferior classes.&quot; It is not usually those whose position
  is comfortable and whose prospects are bright who emigrate; it is those who
  are pinched and dissatisfied, those to whom no prospect seems open. There are
  heralds' colleges in Europe that drive a good business in providing a certain
  class of Americans with pedigrees and coats of arms; but it is probably well
  for this sort of self-esteem that the majority of us cannot truly trace our
  ancestry very far. We had some Pilgrim Fathers, it is true; likewise some Quaker
  fathers, and other sorts of fathers; yet the majority even of the early settlers
  did not come to America for &quot;freedom to worship God,&quot; but because
  they were poor, dissatisfied, unsuccessful, or recklessly adventurous &#8212;  many
  because they were evicted, many to escape imprisonment, many because they were
  kidnapped, many as self-sold bondsmen, as indentured apprentices, or mercenary
  soldiers. It is the virtue of new soil, the freedom of opportunity given by
  the possibility of expansion, that has here transmuted into wholesome human
  growth material that, had it remained in Europe, might have been degraded and
  dangerous, just as in Australia the same conditions have made respected and
  self-respecting citizens out of the descendants of convicts, and even out of
  convicts themselves.</p>

  Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.</strong> (8.)</p>
  <p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
    to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
    of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
    you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others. You
    say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the earth
    does not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess
    the soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the
    land.</p>
  <p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
    of conscience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
        our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular,
        leaving the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I
        being the eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing
        so I have not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let
        them work for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would
        have had to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not
        be clear?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal
    sin, and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to
    make restitution and to do penance?</p>
  <p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
    land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
    supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a
    number of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly
    and prosper, you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership
    in the river, refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought
    it of them; and that thus they had become rich without work, while the others,
    though working hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly
    able to exist?</p>
  <p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
  <p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
    action:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby
        to minister to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does
        not
      drink of
        the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the river
      contribute their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all
      water is supplied
        either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry which
        is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for the
        water.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
    yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
  <p>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly depriving
    a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless
    he will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves
    his victim to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. But I would like
    to point out how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among
    private owners, ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks
    the largest facts.</p>
  <p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
    where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
    are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
    was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
    centuries has condemned it to desertion? History tells us. It was private
    property in land; the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw that
    ancient Italy was perishing; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop
    of men, let in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of
    Odin and Thor, and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the
    East shivered the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars
    of Mohammedan hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church
    of St. Sophia trampled the cross to rear the crescent!</p>
  <p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
    tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
    sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
    are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
    you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
    they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Let any one who wishes visit this diocese and see with his own eyes
      the vast and boundless extent of the fairest land in Europe that has been
      ruthlessly

      is now abandoned to a loneliness and solitude more depressing than that
      of the prairie
        or the wilderness. Thus has this land system actually exercised the power
        of life and death on a vast scale, for which there is no parallel even
      in the dark records of slavery. &#8212; Bishop Nulty&#8217;s Letter to
      the Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Meath.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
    and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the
    growth of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the
    artificial scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem
    as if there is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</strong></p>
  <p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
    private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
    the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
    the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you may
    see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet,
    that prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the
    midst of the earth.</p>
  <p>To the mere materialist this is sin and shame. Shall we to whom this world
    is God&#8217;s world &#8212; we who hold that man is called to this life
    only as a prelude to a higher life &#8212; shall we defend it? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of
    vague injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an
    easy means for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches
    and communions to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are
    serving God. Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice
    to the teaching of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle
    of which the whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to
    our own is witness &#8212; the Tudor tyranny would never have arisen, and
    the separation of the church been averted; had the clergy of France never
    substituted charity for justice, the monstrous iniquities of the ancient
    r&eacute;gime would never have brought the horrors of the Great Revolution;
    and in my own country had those who should have preached justice not satisfied
    themselves with preaching kindness, chattel slavery could never have demanded
    the holocaust of our civil war.</p>
  <p>No, your Holiness; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to
    God his due while denying to their fellows the rights be gave them, so charity
    unsupported by justice can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing
    condition of labor. Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods
    to feed the poor and give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would
    continue while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting
    his wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve
      it, but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may
      do will be the danger of doing harm.</li>
    <li> Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the
      vice that is born of it breeds.</li>
    <li> Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
      of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for
      mere laborers, for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
    <li> Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are
      too many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
    <li> <strong>Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but
      drives further the class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodations
      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</strong></li>
    <li> Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
      on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
    <li> <strong>Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
      are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
      reducing their wages.</strong></li>
    <li> Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
      it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
      or partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he
      will do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
    <li> Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic
      times who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try
      to beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
      narrow and crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let
      him open tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful
      and attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not
      be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will
      it not be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of
      his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to landowners?
      Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things will
      start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
  <p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of
    God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

A. If adopted in one country of great natural opportunities, and not in others,
its tendency would not only be to cause an influx of foreigners, but also to
make their coming highly desirable. Our own experience in the United States,
when we had an abundance of free land and were begging the populations of the
world to come to us, offers a faint suggestion of what might be expected.</p>
