          <p>To have a vibrant downtown, there needs to be  ongoing
                      redevelopment. Even if population in the surrounding area
            is holding constant, the
                        needs and wants of the community will be changing, and
            we can either accommodate them in the center of things, in the central
            business
                          district (CBD), where they are accessible to people
            from a 360&deg; radius,
                          or find that they have moved to the fringe, leaving

          <p>When local population is rising, we have the choice
            of letting the city sprawl out, forcing people to drive further and
            further, or we
                      can offer the option of making the choice downtown sites
            available for redevelopment: a two-story building gets replaced with
            a 4-story
                      building, or an 8-story building with a 12-story building.
            An acre downtown, properly developed, may prevent the premature development
                      of 10 or more acres on the fringe.</p>

        <div align="left">How do we motivate the private sector to undertake
          this redevelopment? The
                    first step is very simple (though it may require enabling
          legislation at the state level): divorce two taxes that never should
          have been
                    married. The divorce I refer to is the property tax, which
          is two taxes whose effects are very different.</div>

      <p>When we tax building values, we get slower redevelopment;
              we get buildings which aren't as well outfitted to serve owners' or tenants'
              needs; we get poorer maintenance; we get less of what we want more of. When
              we tax land values, we get more intensive use of well-located land. We get
              faster redevelopment. We get jobs. We get vibrant downtowns. We get entrepreneurs
              who are able to afford a location in the middle of things, where the market
              hums, instead of a place on the edge of things where they are accessible
              to only part of the  community.</p>
      <p>Suppose you were the owner of a piece of land downtown. Your
        parents left it to you, and you tore down the obsolete building that
        they had there. You feel that the site has potential, and you don't want
        to
        sell it, because you really
        want to leave it to your grandchildren, but you don't really feel like
        building on it quite yet. Your carrying costs are low, because while
        your neighbors
        are paying taxes on both their buildings and their land, you are only
        being taxed on the land, and it isn't much. You can cover your taxes
        if you rent
        parking spaces each month, and that suits you just fine. And it doesn't
        bother you that if someone wants to open a business, they'll have to
        locate outside
        the CBD. If someone came along and offered you enough money, you'd consider
        selling, but it seems pretty unlikely that someone would do so. (Call
        that price $50,000 or $500,000 or $5,000,000, depending on the size of
        your town
        or city -- choose the one that makes sense in your part of the US.)
</div>
  </div>
 
  <p>Now someone comes along and talks about divorcing the two pieces
          of the property tax, and lowering the millage rate on buildings, and increasing
          the millage rate on land. The owners on either side of you, who are conducting
          businesses which serve customers and employ people, are going to pay less
          on their buildings than they currently pay, and all three of you are going
          to pay more property tax on your land. You can't cover your higher property
          taxes on the land with just a parking lot. You have three choices: (a) pay
          those property taxes from some other part of your portfolio and hold onto
          the nearly
          vacant land for your grandchildren; (b) build something on that site which
          will earn you enough rent to cover the taxes; or (c) lower your asking price
          to, say, $40,000, or $400,000 or $4,000,000. Someone who wants to build can
          afford to do so: while his land tax is higher, he won't be penalized as much
          for building a good building.

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Or think of this situation: you own an
            older building downtown, and your single tenant pays you enough to
            cover the taxes and enough to
                      live on. The building represents a tiny share of the total
            value of the property &#8212; that is, the land share of real estate
            value (LSREV) is approaching 90%. If the taxes on your building go
            down, and the
                      taxes on your land go up, you are likely to seriously consider
            replacing the aging building with something newer and larger, more
            suitable to
                      the current decade and century. And you will not ask a
            huge rent, because you want to be sure you fill that new building
            with tenants.
            Or you
                      will decide that this is too much like work, and be willing
            to sell the property to someone who is prepared to redevelop it now,
            instead
                      of leaving it to your grandchildren to redevelop someday.</p>

                  that which benefits the community, instead of that which only benefits
                  their heirs. Collect for the commons more of the value of the land,

      land is far more abundant than we realize.</b></small></small> </small></small><br>
      <small>We utilize less than 5% of the total land area in the United
      States for urban purposes, including housing, commerce, and
      manufacturing. As you fly across the country all you see is farm,
      timber, desert and an occasional small community. While less than 5%
      of our nation's land area is needed for urban purposes, much vacant
      land within existing cities is bypassed because it is cheaper to
      build further out than pay the high prices demanded for the more
      efficient, better located, land. The result is urban sprawl. Why do
      we choose to utilize land distant from employment, social, and civic
      needs while bypassing superior land? Why do many of us choose to
      spend two hours each day commuting to work? Why do our older cities
      fail to renew or rebuild obsolete buildings? Sprawl is not just about
      the density of land use. In many cities only one half of the land is
      devoted to housing and commercial uses while the other half is vacant
      or under-improved. Could it be that there are inefficient
      requirements built into some public policies? Smart growth should not
      be constrained by archaic patterns that impede or misappropriate free
      and open urban land usage. Local ordinances and practices within
      cities that force accelerated suburban sprawl should be abolished. We
      don't need more regulation, we need greater freedom to act
      responsibly. Individuals should have the opportunity to decide
      whether they want to live in the suburbs or in the city. This should
      not be a coerced decision because of a public policy that impedes
      growth within the city. Simple tax reform can help to achieve some of
      the goals and objectives of smart growth without government
      intervention and wasteful subsidies.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><b>Counterproductive
      growth limitations and regulations should be abolished.</b> </small><br>
      <small>Property
      taxes should not be levied on new construction or existing
      improvements, when the revenue needed could be obtained from the land
      values created and maintained by the community.</small>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
      property tax could be shifted to reduce the incentives for
      sprawl. If the property tax were taken off urban buildings and
      focused on the land itself, this would penalize land speculation and
      would reward people who build on their land.</span> Thus land
      speculation,
      which promotes a "leap frog" development out of the city and into the
      surrounding countryside, would decrease. The proposed shift from
      traditional property tax to a "land value tax" would penalize land
      speculation and encourage urban redevelopment.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Removing the tax on
      buildings makes them cheaper to construct, renovate and operate, and
      more affordable to buy or rent. Urban construction creates urban
    jobs. Capital and labor both benefit.</span></small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A Strategy for Urban
      Renewal</b>
      </small><br>
      <small>Established cities could adopt some very practical long-term
      measures that will make the city a place where people can and will
      want to live, work, and play in safety. What few city leaders
      understand is the destructive role that taxation has played in the
      out-migration of people and business.</small>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is needed is a continuously
      self-renewing city and a public
      policy that can work effectively. Buildings have a limited useful
      life. Continuous maintenance and frequent retrofitting sometimes
      extends this life span. Other buildings reach a point where they
      should be replaced. Some buildings sit vacant for decades even in the
      city's central business district. Valuable parcels of land are left
      undeveloped or paved over and used as surface parking lots. The
    result is a lower tax base and an eyesore.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As urban buildings deteriorate,
      owners often don't renovate,
      remodel or make repairs because their property tax may rise. Thus the
      typical property tax creates suburban sprawl and urban decay.
      Shifting the property tax off buildings and onto land reverses these
      processes. Taxing land more than buildings usually reduces taxes for
    homeowners.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One means that has long been
      available but not brought into
      general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
      to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
      market for speculation a costly proposition. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>... As the city
      begins to renew itself -- as property owners are no longer penalized
      when they renovate or build new structures -- businesses and people
      will increasingly see the city as a more desirable place and not just
      in a few neighborhoods that now benefit by abatement programs and
      public subsidies.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Exempting property improvements from taxation and collecting all
      of the property tax from land values (which are created by the
      community as a whole and not by individuals) is the cornerstone to
      continuous self-renewal and the reduction of urban sprawl. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The ideal
      public policy would be to reduce taxes on production and commerce and
      raise public revenue from non-distorting revenue sources.
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That non-distorting revenue source
      is land and natural resources.
      The central problem which limits the operational success of the
      economy is the failure to procure the public value which is created
    by the community. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This value ought to be reserved
      for the community to pay for
      public improvements. However, this value is to a large extent
      diverted into private pockets by speculation in land and natural
      resource values. The correct approach is to create a system in which
      no-one, except the citizenry as a whole, is rewarded by the
    collection of publicly created values.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists can agree that the
      economically efficient public
      finance system is one in which revenue is drawn from the rent that
      people pay for the use of land and natural resources. These payments
      do not distort economic activity. Land rent, because it is pure
      surplus, could be taken and used for any purpose and there would be
      no negative consequences for the allocation of labor and capital, or
      in the use of land and natural resources. If this surplus is invested
      in needed infrastructure and other public services, it will in turn
      increase land values for future public investment. ... <a

      <small>While at one time this area might have been an appropriate place
      for a
      neighborhood of single family homes, it appeared to me that that time
      had passed a decade or so ago. It seemed to me that the path of
      progress would -- if the incentives were logical and the market
      responsive to signals -- have caused the private sector to have
      redeveloped that site. Such re-development might have been painful to
      the residents of the neighborhood, but would have put now-choice land
      to a higher and better use than single-family homes.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>But our system wasn't designed to send signals all that well --
      Connecticut law required properties to be reassessed once every decade
      (and I've heard that once in early '70s and once in the late 80's was
      construed to satisfy that requirement).</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
      <br>
      <small>But if the properties had been reassessed on a regular basis,
      with
      market-based values assigned first to the land and the residual being
      assigned to the existing buildings, the homeowners themselves would
      have been in a position to make their own rational decisions on whether
      it was worth it to them to continue to occupy extremely valuable land
      (and pay the taxes on it), or more to their advantage to accept an
      offer from someone who was prepared to put it to a higher and better
      use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
      <br>
      <small>Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or
      something else
      that was a highly appropriate use for its site -- and typical of the
      neighborhood -- 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
      a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial
      buildings. The home or diner is something everyone else has to walk
      around, drive around. If that site were well developed, it could
      prevent the premature development of far less desirable sites on the
      fringe of town -- an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
      acres on the fringe.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>

      <small>But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed,
      land
      first and buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which
      tell us when it might be time to move on.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      In the absence of such a system of regular revaluations and a property
      tax which is concentrated on land values rather than equally on land
      and buildings, New London turned to eminent domain. But eminent domain
      is not the problem here. Lack of appropriate signals is the problem. </small>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
      <br>
      <small>Our land, particularly the best-located land, is a common asset
      on
      which we are all dependent. Allowing individuals or corporations to
      occupy it without compensating the rest of us for its value is the
      underlying problem, and solving that problem through good assessment
      and rational (that is, land value) taxes is the way to solve it. When
      we do that, a lot of problems will begin to fall away.&nbsp; <a
