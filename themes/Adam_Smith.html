  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
      <br />
  Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing
  the processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
  do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
  tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the
  payer works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes
  it, of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 25 or in lesser
  degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
  tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
  taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. I.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">25. It is common, besides taxing improvements, as fast
        as they are made, to levy higher taxes upon land when put to its best
        use than when put to partial use or to no use at all. This is upon the
        theory that when his land is used the owner gets full income from it
        and can afford to pay high taxes; but that he gets little or no income
        when the land is out of use, and so cannot afford to pay much. It is
        an absurd but perfectly legitimate illustration of the pretentious doctrine
        of taxation according to ability to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Examples are numerous. Improved building lots, and even
        those that are only plotted for improvement, are usually taxed more than
        contiguous unused and unplotted land which is equally in demand for building
        purposes and equally valuable. So coal land, iron land, oil land, and
        sugar land are as a rule taxed less as land when opened up for appropriate
        use than when lying idle or put to inferior uses, though the land value
        be the same. Any serious proposal to put land to its appropriate use
        is commonly regarded as a signal for increasing the tax upon it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers through
    many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase
        prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer,
        increasing as they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been
        often attempted, the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and
        the borrower must pay it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses
        it in his business, he in his turn must get back the tax from his customers,
        or his business becomes unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings,
        the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
        will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular
        profit and the tax besides. If we impose a tax upon manufactures or imported
        goods, the manufacturer or importer will charge it in a higher price
        to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and the retailer to the consumer.
        Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only
        pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this amount to everyone
        who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital he has advanced
        in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,
        book viii, ch. iii, subd. 2.</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>c. Certainty</em></p>
  <p>No other tax, direct or indirect, conforms so closely to the third maxim. &quot;Land
    lies out of doors.&quot; It cannot be hidden; it cannot be &quot;accidentally&quot; overlooked.
    Nor can its value be seriously misstated. Neither under-appraisement nor
    over-appraisement to any important degree is possible without the connivance
    of the whole community. 27 The land values of a neighborhood are matters
    of common knowledge. Any intelligent resident can justly appraise them, and
    every other intelligent resident can fairly test the appraisement. Therefore,
    the tyranny, corruption, fraud, favoritism, and evasions that are so common
    in connection with the taxation of imports, manufactures, incomes, personal
    property, and buildings &#8212; the values of which, even when the object
    itself cannot be hidden, are so distinctly matters of minute special knowledge
    that only experts can fairly appraise them &#8212; would be out of the question
    if the single tax were substituted for existing fiscal methods. 28</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">27. The under-appraisements so common at present, and
        alluded to in note 25, are possible because the community, ignorant of
        the just principles of taxation, does connive at them. Under-appraisements
        are not secret crimes on the part of assessors; they are distinctly recognized,
        but thoughtlessly disregarded when not actually insisted upon, by the
        people themselves. And this is due to the dishonest ideas of taxation
        that are taught. Let the vicious doctrine that people ought to pay taxes
        according to their ability give way to the honest principle that they
        should pay in proportion to the benefits they receive, which benefits,
        as we have already seen, are measured by the land values they own, and
        underappraisement of land would cease. No assessor can befool the community
        in respect of the value of the land within his jurisdiction.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And, with the cessation of general under-appraisement,
        favoritism in individual appraisements also would cease. General under-appraisement
        fosters unfair individual appraisements. If land were generally appraised
        at its full value, a particular unfair appraisement would stand out in
        such relief that the crime of the assessor would be exposed. But now
        if a man's land is appraised at a higher valuation than his neighbor's
        equally valuable land, and he complains of the unfairness, he is promptly
        and effectually silenced with a warning that his land is worth much more
        than it is appraised at, anyhow, and if he makes a fuss his appraisement
        will be increased. To complain further of the deficient taxation of his
        neighbor is to invite the imposition of a higher tax upon himself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">28. If you wish to test the merits in point of certainty
        of the single tax as compared with other taxes, go to a real estate agent
        in your community, and, showing him a building lot upon the map, ask
        him its value. If he inquires about the improvements, instruct him to
        ignore them. He will be able at once to tell you what the lot is worth.
        And if you go to twenty other agents their estimates will not materially
        vary from his. Yet none of the agents will have left his office. Each
        will have inferred the value from the size and location of the lot.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But suppose when you show the map to the first agent you
        ask him the value of the land and its improvements. He will tell you
        that he cannot give an estimate until he examines the improvements. And
        if it is the highly improved property of a rich man he will engage building
        experts to assist him. Should you ask him to include the value of the
        contents of the buildings, he would need a corps of selected experts,
        including artists and liverymen, dealers in furniture and bric-a-brac,
        librarians and jewelers. Should you propose that he also include the
        value of the occupant's income, the agent would throw up his hands in
        despair.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">If without the aid of an army of experts the agent should
        make an estimate of these miscellaneous values, and twenty others should
        do the same, their several estimates would be as wide apart as ignorant
        guesses usually are. And the richer the owner of the property the lower
        as a proportion would the guesses probably be.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now turn the real estate agent into an assessor, and is
        it not plain that he would appraise the land values with much greater
        certainty and cheapness than he could appraise the values of all kinds
        of property? With a plot map before him he might fairly make every appraisement
        without leaving his desk at the town hall.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And there would be no material difference if the property
        in question were a farm instead of a building lot. A competent farmer
        or business man in a farming community can, without leaving his own door-yard,
        appraise the value of the land of any farm there; whereas it would be
        impossible for him to value the improvements, stock, produce, etc., without
        at least inspecting them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>d. Equality</strong></em></p>
  <p>In respect of the fourth maxim the single tax bears more equally&#8212; that
    is to say, more justly &#8212; than any other tax. It is the only tax that
    falls upon the taxpayer in proportion to the pecuniary benefits he receives
    from the public; 29 and its tendency, accelerating with the increase of the
    tax, is to leave every one the full fruit of his own productive enterprise
    and effort. 30</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">29 The benefits of government are not the only public
        benefits whose value attaches exclusively to land. Communal development
        from whatever cause produces the same effect. But as it is under the
        protection of government that land-owners are able to maintain ownership
        of land and through that to enjoy the pecuniary benefits of advancing
        social conditions, government confers upon them as a class not only the
        pecuniary benefits of good government but also the pecuniary benefits
        of progress in general.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">30. &quot;Here are two men of equal incomes &#8212; that
        of the one derived from the exertion of his labor, that of the other
        from the rent of land. Is it just that they should equally contribute
        to the expenses of the state? Evidently not. The income of the one represents
        wealth he creates and adds to the general wealth of the state; the income
        of the other represents merely wealth that he takes from the general
        stock, returning nothing.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217;</p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. <strong>The role
    of land in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic
    growth was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith,
    Ricardo and Malthus.</strong> But the intervening years have seen land slide
    into a more peripheral status within economic analysis. Political economists
    working in the Marxian tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour
    relation as the key to understanding the capitalist economy.1 Neo-classical
    economists typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor
    of production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists
    have also given little attention to land because typically their analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.

<blockquote>
  <p>What qualities make for the best (or least-bad) tax system? Public finance
    economists identify simplicity, efficiency, fairness, and revenue sufficiency
    as the proper objectives of tax policy.4 In his Wealth of Nations,5 Adam
    Smith identified equality, certainty (clear manner and quantity), convenience,
    and economy in collection. Transparency is also an important criterion; visible
    taxes are better than hidden taxes.</p>
  <p>In Progress and Poverty (1879), his most important book, Henry George contended
    the ideal tax would most closely conform to the following conditions, similar
    to those of Smith:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1. That the tax bears as lightly as possible upon production, minimizing
      the excess burden or deadweight loss.<br>
      2. That the revenues be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly
      as may be upon the ultimate payers&#8212;so as to take from the people
      as little as possible in addition to what it yields the government.<br>
      3. That it be certain and visible, so as to give the least opportunity
      for tyranny or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation
      to lawbreaking and evasion on the part of the taxpayers.<br>
      4. That it be equitable, giving no citizen an arbitrary advantage or privilege,
      and in being consistent with moral principles.6<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation is central to the political philosophy of the founding
    fathers of the United States. Far from being a new idea, or the idea of a
    small group of thinkers, it is a concept embraced by many of the most important
    figures from our history: John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson,
    and today, Milton Friedman. Land value taxation is part of America&#8217;s
    proud and distinguished tradition of political philosophy. Surely it belongs
    in the national debate over how best to reform the nation&#8217;s tax system.

  <p>Commons Rent</p>
  <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be, a money-free
    zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and the rest of us) to
    understand is commons rent.</p>
  <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord. In
    economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid because
    of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound puzzling, but
    consider this. A city has available a million apartments. In absolute terms,
    that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But the city is confined geographically
    and demand for apartments is intense. In this economic sense, apartments
    are scarce. Now think back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage
    you pay the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
    or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
    is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San Franciscans
    write such large checks to landlords and banks, while people in Nebraska
    don&#8217;t.</p>
  <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply. Rent
    due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can (and should)
    debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself arises automatically.
    And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because this helps the larger economy
    allocate scarce resources efficiently. Other methods of allocation are possible.
    We can distribute scarce things on a first come, first served basis, or by
    lottery, political power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though,
    that selling scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach,
    and such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
  <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam Smith, David
    Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because it constituted
    most of the money earned by landowners, and land was then a major cost of
    production. The supply of land, these economists noted, is limited, but demand
    for it steadily increases. So, therefore, does its rent. Thus, landowners
    benefit from what Mill called the unearned increment &#8212; the rise in
    land value attributable not to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially
    created increase in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
  <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further. Seeing
    both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked a logical question:
    Why does poverty persist despite economic growth? The answer, he believed,
    was the appropriation of rent by landowners. Even as the economy grew, the
    property rights system and the scarcity of land diverted almost all the gains
    to a landowning minority. Whereas competition limited the gains of working
    people, nothing kept down the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted,
    the value of their land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated
    a steep tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
    Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
    economists never took him seriously.</p>
  <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in rent;
    it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to capital and labor.
    But the twenty-first century ecological crisis brings rent back to center-stage.
    Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s scarce, but clean water, undisturbed
    habitat, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
  <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and allocation
    of property rights are the primary factors in determining who pays whom for
    what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution rights are given free
    to past polluters, the rent from the polluted ecosystem will also go to them.
    That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden products will rise as pollution
    is limited (remember, if demand is constant, a reduction in supply causes
    prices to go up), and those higher prices will flow to producers (which is
    to say, polluters).</p>
  <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
    and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
    the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If the
    trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures on
    public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
  <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting corporations
    are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts getting the
    rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers will pay commons
    rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves as beneficiaries
    of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will be the same, but his
    payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden products. The more
    he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back
    less than they put in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic
    incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
    incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s interest
    to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent for scarce things
    works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re
    a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake of argument) your
    responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations, you want to
    increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits you sell,
    or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you lower the number
    of permits. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
