Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
But I have not time to enter into further details. I can only ask you
to think upon this thing, and the more you will see its desirability.
As an English friend of mine puts it: "No taxes and a pension for
everybody;" and why should it not be? To take land values for public
purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes
a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus
accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to
anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were
deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man
who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is
heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give
them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything
that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a
right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not
degrade. Charity schools do degrade children that are sent to them, but
public schools do not.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But all such benefits as these, while great, would be
incidental. The great thing would be that the reform I propose would
tend to open opportunities to labour and enable men to provide
employment for themselves. That is the great advantage. We should gain
the enormous productive power that is going to waste all over the
country, the power of idle hands that would gladly be at work. And that
removed, then you would see wages begin to mount. It is not that
everyone would turn farmer, or everyone would build himself a house if
he had an opportunity for doing so, but so many could and would, as to
relieve the pressure on the labour market and provide employment for
all others. And as wages mounted to the higher levels, then you would
see the productive power increased. The country where wages are high is
the country of greatest productive powers. Where wages are highest,
there will invention be most active; there will labour be most
intelligent; there will be the greatest yield for the expenditure of
exertion. The more you think of it the more clearly you will see that
what I say is true. I cannot hope to convince you in an hour or two,
but I shall be content if I shall put you upon inquiry. ... <a

<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George, a
    themed collection of
excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THAT the masses now festering in the tenement houses of our cities, under
    conditions which breed disease and death, and vice and crime, should each
    family have its healthful home, set in its garden; that the working farmer
    should be able to make a living with a daily average of two or three hours'
    work, which more resembled healthy recreation than toil; that his home should
    be replete with all the conveniences yet esteemed luxuries; that it should
    be supplied with light and heat, and power if needed, and connected with
    those of his neighbors by the telephone; that his family should be free to
    libraries, and lectures, and scientific apparatus and instruction; that they
    should be able to visit the theater, or concert, or opera, as often as they
    cared to do so, and occasionally to make trips to other parts of the country
    or to Europe; that, in short, not merely the successful man, the one in a
    thousand, but the man of ordinary parts and ordinary foresight and prudence,
    should enjoy all that advancing civilization can bring to elevate and expand
    human life, seems, in the light of existing facts, as wild a dream as ever
    entered the brain of hasheesh eater. Yet the powers already within the grasp
    of man make it easily possible.&nbsp; &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp21.html">Social
    Problems &#8212; Chapter 21: City and Country</a>. <br>
              <br>
GIVE labor a free field and its full earnings; take for the benefit of the whole
community that fund which the growth of the community creates, and want and the
fear of want would be gone. The springs of production would be set free, and
the enormous increase of wealth would give the poorest ample comfort. Men would
no more worry about finding employment than they worry about finding air to breathe;
they need have no more care about physical necessities than do the lilies of
the field. The progress of science, the march of invention, the diffusion of
knowledge, would bring their benefits to all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With this abolition of want and the fear of want, the admiration of riches would
decay, and men would seek the respect and approbation of their fellows in other
modes than by the acquisition and display of wealth. In this way there would
be brought to the management of public affairs and the administration of common
funds the skill, the attention, the fidelity and integrity, that can now only
be secured for private interests, and a railroad or gas works might be operated
on public account, not only more economically and efficiently than, as at present,
under joint stock management, but as economically and efficiently as would be
possible under a single ownership. The prize of the Olympian games, that called
forth the most strenuous exertions of all Greece, was but a wreath of wild olive;
for a bit of ribbon men have over and over again performed services no money
could have bought. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> &#8212; Book

in Social Organization and Social Life</a></p>
  <p>SHORT-SIGHTED is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the master
    motive of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world is full.
    It sees not the present, and reads not the past aright. If you would move
    men to action, to what shall you appeal? Not to their pockets, but to their
    patriotism; not to selfishness but to sympathy. Self-interest is, as it were,
    a mechanical force &#8212; potent, it is true; capable of large and wide
    results. But there is in human nature what may be likened to a chemical force;
    which melts and fuses and overwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. "All
    that a man hath will he give for his life" &#8212; that is self-interest.
    But in loyalty to higher impulses men will give even life. <br>
              <br>
It is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people with heroes and
saints. It is not selfishness that on every page of the world's history; bursts
out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or sheds the soft radiance of benignant
lives. It was not selfishness that turned Gautama's back to his royal home or
bade the Maid of Orleans lift the sword from the altar; that held the Three Hundred
in the Pass of Thermopylae, or gathered into Winkelried's bosom the sheaf of
spears; that chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the galley, or brought little
starving children during the Indian famine tottering to the relief stations with
yet weaker starvelings in their arms! Call it religion, patriotism, sympathy,
the enthusiasm for humanity, or the love of God &#8212; give it what name you
will; there is yet a force which overcomes and drives out selfishness; a force
which is the electricity of the moral universe; a force beside which all others
are weak. Everywhere that men have lived it has shown its power, and today, as
ever, the world is full of it. To be pitied is the man who has never seen and
never felt it. Look around! among common men and women, amid the care and the
struggle of daily life in the jar of the noisy street and amid the squalor where
want hides &#8212; everywhere, and there is the darkness lighted with the tremulous
play of its lambent flames. He who has not seen it has walked with shut eyes.
He who looks may see, as says Plutarch, that "the soul has a principle of kindness
in itself, and is born to love, as well as to perceive, think, or remember." <br>
              <br>
And this force of forces &#8212; that now goes to waste or assumes perverted
forms &#8212; we may use for the strengthening and building up and ennobling
of society, if we but will, just as we now use physical forces that once seemed
but powers of destruction. All we have to do is but to give it freedom and scope. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> &#8212; Book

THE efficiency of labor always increases with the habitual wages of labor &#8212; for
high wages mean increased self-respect, intelligence, hope and energy. Man is
not a machine, that will do so much and no more; he is not an animal, whose powers
may reach thus far and no further. It is mind, not muscle, which is the great
agent of production. The physical power evolved in the human frame is one of
the weakest of forces, but for the human intelligence the resistless currents
of nature flow, and matter becomes plastic to the human will. To increase the
comforts, and leisure, and independence of the masses is to increase their intelligence;
it is to bring the brain to the aid of the hand; it is to engage in the common
work of life the faculty which measures the animalcule and traces the orbits
of the stars!&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>OUT upon nature, in upon him himself, back through the mists that shroud
    the past, forward into the darkness that overhangs the future, turns the
    restless desire that arises when the animal wants slumber in satisfaction.
    Beneath things he seeks the law; he would know how the globe was forged,
    and the stars were hung, and trace to their sources the springs of life.
    And then, as the man develops his nobler nature, there arises the desire
    higher yet &#8212; the passion of passions, the hope of hopes &#8212; the
    desire that he, even he, may somehow aid in making life better and brighter,
    in destroying want and sin, sorrow and shame. He masters and curbs the animal;
    he turns his back upon the feast and renounces the place of power; he leaves
    it to others to accumulate wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves
    in the warm sunshine of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and
    never can see; for a fame, or it may be but for a scant justice, that can
    only come long after the clods have rattled upon his coffin lid. He toils
    in the advance, where it is cold, and there is little cheer from men, and
    the stones are sharp and the brambles thick. <br>
              <br>
  Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that stab like knives, he builds
  for the future; he cuts the trail that progressive humanity may hereafter broaden
  into a highroad. Into higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons, and
  a star that rises in the east leads him on. Lo! the pulses of the man throb
  with the yearnings of the god &#8212; he would aid in the process of the suns! &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp023.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp023.html"> &#8212; Book

      OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Apart from Free Trade, the great
economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes
now not as a document of historic interest but as a challenge to
politicians, indeed to the entire electorate, to consider again the
causes of poverty and the basic issues of social and economic justice.
Perhaps current disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that
if justice in the community can only be achieved at the expense of
individual liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing
taxation and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of
the individual are complementary and that taxes may be raised without
undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major contribution
to current political and economic thought. Indeed it deserves a place
in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and yearning for a society
in which the genius of every person would be nurtured and the liberty
of every person respected. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>This leads to still
a third important dimension of ecological
economics: the belief that human fulfillment in the final analysis
comes not from consumption and exploitation of natural resources and
material goods. Because the concept of an ecological footprint is so
important, retreating to a less imposing and more respectful
relationship with the earth leads to an interest in a lifestyle that
has come to be known as &#8220;voluntary simplicity.&#8221;</big> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">113</span></small> It
grows from greater compatibility and appreciation of nature, an ability
to live in harmony with it, and a capacity to enjoy community with the
environment and its natural beauty. Higher levels of human realization
and actualization arise from communal interaction, and from the pursuit
of wisdom and relationships. It is no accident that ecological
economics has made frequent reference to still another emergent
tradition of economic philosophy now known as humanistic economics.
This latter builds on the thinking of Abraham Maslow and the human
potential movement born of the 1970s.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">114</span></small> In
that framework, material needs are gradually supplanted by social needs
which are ultimately surpassed by moral needs and spiritual awareness.</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><small>115 ...</small></span></small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The grant of land sites and
other natural resources to individuals and
corporations in leasehold rather than freehold has an additional
advantage beyond the revenue collected in rent to support the general
purposes of government. This is the restoration of ownership of the
earth to all people: what in Georgist terms and in classical philosophy
is their birthright. Acknowledgment&nbsp;that the earth
belongs to us all, and is both our entitlement and our responsibility,
has the effect of enfranchising the people of the earth everywhere,
perhaps ennobling them as well. At a time in human history when the
incomes of the world&#8217;s people are increasingly disparate, and where
wealth is even more unequally distributed, it must be recognized that
titles to the resources of the earth are the most unequally, and
unjustly, distributed of all.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">132</span></small></small>
<small>Recognition of this truth may come as a revelation; indeed it
may well
be revolutionary in some
circles. But restoration of birthrights to which all people have a just
and proper claim may be the single most important and effective means
by which to facilitate and ensure sustainable economic policies
worldwide. </small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All this leads to the likelihood
also that personal growth can also be
enhanced by the forgoing factors: greater community facility, greater
identification with &#8220;the commons,&#8221; and greater access to nature all
enrich human experience. Georgists argue that more intensive use of
land sites, more efficient use of (and hence reduced consumption of)
material resources, and greater regard for the value of time will add
character to human life by encouraging mental capital more than by
physical capital. Enjoyment from reading books or exploring the
internet may finally trump snowmobiles and stock car racing. This
value-added dimension of human awareness comports with the
environmentalist argument that it is the lack of access to nature that
frequently makes people regard it as an instrument. ... <a

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace,
Justice
and Economic Reform</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the
classical liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his statement
that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One tradition in classical
liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
as exemplified by Murray
Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any
excess in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental problems
with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
rectified.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
another lecture.)</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice is thus a regime in
which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities. </small><big></big></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Getting back to where we started,
is it true that, "If you want
peace-- real peace--you should work for justice?" and if so why?
Well, it's half true. To see why, consider what peace is, and how one
might create it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is unity and harmony. Peace
is people recognizing that we
are all parts of one another, that it is always for ourselves that
the bell tolls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What keeps us from attaining
peace? One of the greatest hindrances
to the attainment of peace -- real peace -- is that resistance that so
many of us feel to tolerating oppression and injustice. When we know
that we, or others we care for, have been treated unjustly, it is
ever so difficult to attain a state of unity and harmony with others.
The leap to peace is so much easier from a position of justice. So,
even though peace and justice are very disparate things, and peace is
much the more attractive one, still it make sense, if you want to
help people reach peace, to work for justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the reason that this is only
half true is that, in fact,
justice is not actually necessary to your attainment of peace. If you
want peace for yourself, you can have it, at any time, in any
circumstances in which you find yourself. Whether you are treated
justly or not, you are a part of the being that is all humanity. Each
person's joy is your joy. Each person's grief is your grief. You
don't have to wait until you are treated justly to see this.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
    Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Work of this sort could be enormously increased, and we are likely to
      find that the problems of housing and education, instead of preceding the elimination
      of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The
      poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter
      housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect
      on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in their
      struggle.</p>
  <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
      will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
      will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
      when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands,
      wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
      on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
  <p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
      annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And I
      say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
      a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
      to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
      on their own two feet right here on earth. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book excerpt
