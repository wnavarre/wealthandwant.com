          and Efficiency</small><br>
          <small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
          <small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
          <small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
          <small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
          <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
          <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
          a case
          for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
          logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
          follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
          principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
          the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
          one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
          is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
          important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
          efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
          because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
          for taxing land has two main parts.&nbsp; The first and more
          traditional part is that taxing land permits the reduction of other
          taxes.&nbsp; This improves efficiency because it reduces the economic
          distortions that cause people to work less and save less.&nbsp; Because
          land is fixed in supply, there is no reduction in economic efficiency
          from taxing it.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The second and less customary part of the efficiency argument
          for
          taxing land is that, apart from the opportunity it offers to reduce
          harmful taxes, taxing land actually improves economic efficiency, in at
        least three ways.&nbsp; </small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">compensation for
        local externalities
        associated with land use</span> can be incorporated into a tax on
        land.&nbsp;    </small></li>
          <li><small>Second, when lending markets are imperfect, taxing land
        improves the
        relative bidding power of persons who face high interest rates.&nbsp;
        This shifts land into the hands of persons who get greater returns from
        it. 
          </small></li>
          <li><small>Third, taxing land reduces the profit from land
        speculation,
        there&shy;by reducing the amount of land speculation, which increases
        the effective supply of land.</small></li>
          </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To estimate the magnitudes of
          the impacts that additional taxes on land
          would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
          report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
          shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
          in the Appendix.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
          taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
          reasons
          why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
          world peace.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
          argument for
          taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
          offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
          rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
          price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
          land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
          increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
          become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
          land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
          on
          land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
          the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
          erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
          because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
          collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
          <small>.</small><br>
          <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
          that the
          return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
          rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
          what land
          is.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing Land is Better Than
          Neutral</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;,
          that
          is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
          land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
          to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>First, a land tax can be used to take account of positive and
          negative
          externalities associated with land use.&nbsp; The typical example
          of a negative externality is pollution.&nbsp; If labor and capital were
          perfectly mobile, then the effect of pollution on near-by locations
          would be reflected entirely in land values.&nbsp; Thus one might say
          that a polluter &#8216;uses&#8217; surrounding land and should pay for that use in
          the form of a &#8216;land tax&#8217; equal to the reduction in the rental value of
          land that results from his activities.&nbsp; Such a land tax would not
          only raise govern&shy;ment revenue, but would also improve efficiency
          by ensuring that people would engage in activities that pro&shy;duced
          pollution only when the benefits of those activities exceeded the costs.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Because labor and capital are not perfectly mobile, pollution
          affects
          not only land values, but also the value of structures and the net
          well-being that people experience from the opportunity to continue to
          live in accustomed places.&nbsp; Efficient management of pollution
          would charge polluters for these costs as well.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>When there is traffic congestion on city streets or on highways,
          bridges, or tunnels, one might say that there is a problem caused by
          people not being charged adequately for the use of particularly
          valuable space.&nbsp; If there is a congestion charge (land tax) that
          reflects the extent to which any one user of streets and highways
          imposes costs on others users in the form of increased travel times,
          then that congestion charge improves efficiency while also raising
          government revenue.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>What applies to negative externalities applies also to positive
          externalities, although now some extra steps in the analysis are
          needed.&nbsp; If there are private activities that raise the rental
          value of surrounding land, such as the provision of a car park in a
          city centre, then to motivate private users of land to undertake these
          activities at efficient levels, one must compensate them for the
          value of the positive externalities they generate.&nbsp; Again, if
          labour and capital were perfectly mobile, these externalities would be
          reflected entirely in changes (this time, positive changes) in land
          values.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>With compensation for the externalities now generating an
          outflow
          from the public treasury rather than an inflow, it is not immediately
          clear that the government can afford to provide efficient
          incentives.&nbsp; However, if the tax regime is one in which the
          government collects all of the rental value of land in taxes, then
          efficient incentives for activities with positive externalities that
          are reflected in land values will be self-financing.&nbsp; What is
          spent in rewarding activities with positive externalities will be
          recaptured from taxes on the land that rises in value.&nbsp; In
          fact, there is bound to be a net surplus, because the improved
          coordination of land uses that would be induced by the rebates for
          positive externalities would make land worth more in the aggregate with
          the rebates than without them.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>If the government collects only a fraction of the rental value
          of land,
          then rewards for positive externalities would not be self-financing,
          and one would need to ask whether this particular use of scarce
          government funds was more important than other potential uses.&nbsp;
          Still, it would be possible to have &#8216;betterment districts&#8217; that would
          levy special-purpose taxes on the land that benefited from activities
          like private parking garages.&nbsp; With such special-purpose taxes
          there is no competition for scarce public funds.&nbsp; And while the
          system of rewards for positive externalities would not generate a net
          surplus for the Treasury as it would under a system of full taxation of
          the rental value of land, it would generate a net improve&shy;ment in
          the efficiency of the economy.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>As with negative externalities, the fact that labor and capital
          are not
          perfectly mobile means that not all of the effects of activities with
          positive externalities are reflected in land values.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <a

        <small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
          and for reasons of economic
          efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
        programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
          terms of social justice is
          founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
          absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
          and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
          economic development and government expenditures should be collected
          by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
        is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
        resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
          institutions capable of implementing a
          recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
          basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
          implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
          heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
          nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
          all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
          are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
          rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
        unimproved condition.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
          terms of economic efficiency is
          founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
          human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
          does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
          revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
          government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
          frequencies and <span style="font-weight: bold;">taxes on activities
          with harmful consequences, such
          as polluting the air.</span> An economy will be more efficient if
          revenue
          sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
          greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
        productivity.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
          the amount of tax that is due
          cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
          taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
          They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
          are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
          fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
          worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
          resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
          levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
          And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
        the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
          more detail these social justice
          and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
          for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
          potential objections are without merit. ... <a

          imposition of taxes generally retards an
          economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
          possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
          less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
          This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
        productive.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
          government-assigned opportunities, on the
          other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
          of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
          But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
          the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
          possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
          productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
        the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
          financing of any worthwhile
          public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
          productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
          public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
          and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
          If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
        sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in
          which our ideas promote a more efficient economy is
          by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
          one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
          political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
          to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
          while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
          prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
          of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
          reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
          others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
        self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
          of growing rich by manipulating
          government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
          government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
          useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span

        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Under the
          conservative or homesteading libertarian versions of
          classical liberalism, the possessor of land might say, "This is my
          land. I didn't ask for these public goods. You have no right to tax
          me to pay for them." Under geoliberalism, on the other hand, the
          community can reply, "You have as much right to the use of land and
          other natural opportunities as anyone else. If you want to exercise
          your rights in this community, these are the taxes you must pay. If
          you don't like it, claim your share of natural opportunities
        somewhere else."</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If people are perfectly mobile and
          have an unlimited range of
          communities to choose among, then they cannot be exploited and need
          not tolerate inefficiency. They will move. Competing communities will
          find that the utility-maximizing public sector equilibrium involves
          providing all local public goods with benefits greater than costs,
          financing them by a combination of fees equal to marginal costs and
          taxes on the land that benefits from differential access to the local
          public goods. There will be no taxes on labor or capital except to
        internalize externalities.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If tastes vary so much that a
          community cannot be filled with
          people with the same taste for local public goods, then it will not
          be possible to finance all worthwhile local public goods by the
        increase in rent that they generate.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The community will either have to
          leave some worthwhile local
          public goods unprovided, or finance them from some other source. But
          in either case the residents are treated fairly if they are free to
          move elsewhere and choose not to do so.<span

        Economists</a><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A similar sort of blinkered
          compartmentalization goes for textbook
          discussions of externalities. The mainstream literature rarely
          highlights the point that, whether by geo-rent taxation or by private
          contract, the tapping of geo-rent promotes internalization of
          externalities. If the government depends on geo-rent, it has a strong
          incentive to increase geo-rents, or to ameliorate externalities. Public
          revenue from site values thus is an important way to internalize
          territorial costs and benefits. The failure to tap geo-rent exacerbates
          externalities. Private communities do base their finances on site
          rentals, and we are less inclined to identify the positives and
          negatives within a private community as &#8220;externalities.&#8221; Territorial
          amenities have been internalized within property relations and

    pollution goes right to a chink in the
    armor of conventionally trained economists (like myself) who are
    overtrained towards becoming protagonists of the price system.&nbsp; To
    the skeptical we are "free market freaks": eco&#8209;freaks who are &#8209;nomic
    rather than &#8209;logical.&nbsp; Whatever our faults we are zealous, and
    carry the conviction of true belief.&nbsp; With the problem at hand,
    however, we can't do what we do best, that is call for price signals,
    punt, and slip away.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The very name "nonpoint" pollution suggests that
    economists see this as just an odd bit of clutter, something
"non&#8209;regular" in their tidy world.&nbsp; Indeed, all pollution was an
    exception, an "externality," until recently (at least at my age it
    seems so).&nbsp; Then they learned you can meter effluents and tax
    them, or trade effluent rights around like private property.&nbsp;
    Thenceforth they could fit pollution right into existing models and
    ideologies with minimum intellectual strain.&nbsp; They were happy as
    Procrustes with a new guest.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But we can't meter runoff &#8212; how frustrating.&nbsp;
    </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>It comes from areas &#8212;how disorienting.
      </small></li>
      <li><small>Its damages are spread
    unequally over other areas, differentially populated &#8212; how
    non-homogenous.&nbsp;    </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
    Standard-brand economists are ill-equipped and
    undisposed to face such problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;
    </small><br>
    <small>Conventional price theory has been accused of
    mocking physics because it uses some elementary calculus, but if so it
    is a poor imitation: it deals with an imaginary world abstracted not
    just from friction but from space and time themselves.&nbsp; Space is
    relegated to one subdiscipline (location theory) and time to another
    (finance), so regular price theorists can spin their webs in purest
    abstraction, undistracted by these details.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most price theory is
    spaceless.&nbsp;</span> Even location
    theory, at least the most common kind, conventionally treats cities as
    Euclidean points: the math is simpler that way.&nbsp; Newton could get
    away with it explaining planetary motion; students of urban sprawl can
    not.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Economists are also
    ill-equipped to deal with
    ecology.</span>&nbsp; Economists' "externalities" pour into a biosphere
    of
    interdependencies at least as complex as what economists purport to
    understand.&nbsp; Economists are too disposed to underrate the
    sensitivity, passion and numbers of Nature's votaries, and the real
    economic value of the philosophical values they celebrate.&nbsp;
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>economists are a
    notable exception, although they probably
    impose more economics on biology than vice versa.&nbsp; But most
    economists treat "eco-freaks" as noisy nuisances.&nbsp; In the absence
    of a real ecologist I will presume to take their part. </small>...<br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SEARCH FOR SURROGATES </span><br>
    <br>
    The frustrated economist, unable to tax runoff,
    still has a bag of tricks.&nbsp; He looks for surrogates to tax,
    something in a sack or bottle that moves through a market: Aha!
    pesticides, fertilizers, salt, they'll do nicely to tax.&nbsp; Thus we
    will "internalize the externalities" and have "proper pricing of
    inputs" to create incentives for correct "trade-offs" in the
"production functions," and we're nearly home.&nbsp; Well, halfway
    home.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Well, we've made a start.&nbsp; A few problems
    remain.&nbsp; One is that a plurality of economists don't like the
    effluent charge approach anyway, even for point sources.&nbsp; They
    follow Coase and prefer to grant pollution entitlements to be traded in
    a free market.&nbsp; Incredibly (to me) this view has prevailed.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In principle they profess not to care what worthy
    few get the original entitlements, but in practise a select company of
    ancient and honorable polluters get them.&nbsp; We now call these
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">"offset
    rights,"</span> a new form of property.&nbsp; In the L.A. Basin (South
    Coast Air Quality Management District), a few have grown rich by
    establishing their respective histories of pollution which they can now
    sell to others who wish to continue this wholesome tradition.&nbsp; The
    demonstration effect on those contemplating new and as yet unregulated
    forms of pollution may be imagined.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Those needing air to breathe?&nbsp; Well, according
    to the modern philosophers they can enter the market, buy up offset
    rights and retire them.&nbsp; Thus is fulfilled Robert Ingersoll's
    forecast a century ago that if some corporation could bottle the air
    they would charge us to breathe.&nbsp; It seems to confirm this dour
    warning from a former Secretary of Labor: &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </small>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"We soon&nbsp; discovered
    ...&nbsp; the danger of allowing economic
    policy to be dominated by business or financial interests or, which
    usually comes to the same thing, orthodox economic analysis."&nbsp;
    (Marshall, p.ix) (emphasis added)</small></div>
    <small><br>
    The public has learned what is being done to it,
    finally, and is rebelling at the Coase logic, which only a Chicago
    economist could love.&nbsp; Offset rights are on the ropes.&nbsp; To
    simplify, therefore, I am not going to speculate how Coase might be
    applied to nonpoint, but just ignore it.&nbsp; I will treat effluent
    charges, and taxes on surrogates, as the conventional economic solution
    to pollution.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    But before leaving this there is a lesson in
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The holders of offset
    rights, whether "ancient and
    honorable" or "innocent purchasers," are demanding compensation.&nbsp;
    Never mind about asking them to pay the victims; they demand payment to
    stop!&nbsp;</span> (Polakovic, 1987) &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">They will probably get it, for if the
    system be
    changed, there will be a taking of something, which they claim is
    property.&nbsp;</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such
    is the force of the Great Secular Superstition,
    that unearned gains are sacred, even those originating with something
    as unworthy as dumping crud on other human beings.&nbsp; </span>This
    superstition is why effective control seems so expensive.&nbsp; My
    remarks will not be instructed by it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The surrogate approach may work
    through regulation
    and prohibition as well as taxation.&nbsp;</span> Banning DDT and other
    organochlorines after 1972 has solved or prevented a lot of nonpoint
    problems, as you know.&nbsp; We may also tax or ban other pesticides of
    long residual life, stimulating a predictably successful quest for
    pesticides that self-destruct after doing their job.</small>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    <small>You've heard the traditional spiel, it is
    arguable.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We can inhibit
    nonpoint pollution, in some ways
    optimally, by controlling surrogates.&nbsp; But let's look at the
    problems that would remain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
    <br>
    </small>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;a.&nbsp;
    Taxes overlook the locational
    element,
    whereas damages vary according to the site of the runoff.&nbsp;</span>
    A tax
    imposed only in critical areas is avoidable by importing the input from
    tax-free zones.&nbsp; We could tax uniformly everywhere; but a uniform
    tax on, say, nitrogen fertilizer would, in order to protect certain
    waters, reduce yields from all lands.&nbsp; Presently that would pull
    more acres into use, worsening other problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">b.&nbsp; Taxes raise
    revenue,
    and recipients develop
    vested interests in the revenue,</span> interests which may come to
    override
    the regulatory purpose of the tax.&nbsp; The main issue of 19th century
    tariff debates was regulation vs. revenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">c.&nbsp; Excise taxes
    are not
    leakproof.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>... The <span style="font-weight: bold;">underground
    economy</span> sometimes rises to the
    surface, in episodes of rebellion, when deregulation is the vogue in
    government.&nbsp; I favor some kinds of deregulation myself, but the
    repressed cowboy psychology seizes these opportunities, too, to evade
    legitimate taxes and prohibitions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>There is a grand tradition of bailing out sellers
    with stocks on hand when a product is taxed or banned.&nbsp; Chlordane
    is a recent example.&nbsp; Dairy producers have been compensated when
    they could not sell their pesticide-contaminated milk.&nbsp; (Carlson,
    1977, p.319) &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>To sell existing stocks tax free, when new ones are
    banned or taxed, creates a nice windfall.&nbsp; The 1972 Federal
    Pesticide Act also "provides for compensation to holders of patents on
    pesticides when registration removal occurs." (ibid.)&nbsp; The problem
    is, this whets the appetite for future windfalls.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It is something like the terrorism treadmill where
    ransoming one hostage stimulates future kidnapping.&nbsp; Some clever
    people will develop new harmful products whose future prohibition or
    taxation will endow them with more windfalls, etc. ad inf.&nbsp; There
    are more than 50,000 agricultural pesticides registered in the U.S.
    (Gianessi, 1987, p.1), giving a notion of the possibilities.&nbsp; This
    is a second kind of "pesticide treadmill."&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Earl Heady has optimistically noted that herbicides
    are becoming more specific, tailored to certain crop problems (Nicol
    and Heady, 1977, p.339).&nbsp; Whatever else you can say about Roundup
    it is anything but that, and I wonder if we have yet to find an optimal
    set of incentives to bend the twig of research in desirable
    directions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">d.&nbsp; A tax on
    nitrogen
    could be avoided by
    growing legumes.</span>&nbsp; Not a bad idea, perhaps, all things
    considered,
    but it just scratches the surface of the kinds of substitution, some of
    it unpredictable, that can occur when you tax a surrogate rather than
    the damaging effluent itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">e.&nbsp; Taxing a
    surrogate
    fails to distinguish
    among individual applicators.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... </small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">f.&nbsp; The
    objectivity and
    moral authority of the
    professionals on whom we must rely to evaluate pesticides is not
    unquestioned.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; ... </small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">What
    would happen if their objectivity were
    questioned on the grounds that they accept large, directed grants from
    pesticide producers, let faculty members consult for the same, and push
    faculty members into grantsmanship?</span>&nbsp; Would Rachel Carson
    have
    found happiness in a UC Department of Entomology?&nbsp; Will Frances
    Moore Lapp&eacute;?&nbsp; Was Earth Day conceived under a grant from
    Monsanto?&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;
    </small><br>
    <small>U.C. Entomology Professor Robert van den Bosch was
    not amused by the dominance of what he called "the pesticide
    mafia."&nbsp; His <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Pesticide
    Conspiracy </span>(1978), although tendentious,
    cites enough specifics to impugn several U.C. administrators, other
    universities, the USDA (that "wholly owned subsidiary" of the chemical
    industry), many congressmen, bankers and food processors, farm
    employers, most producers, salesmen and lobbyists, and at least one
    Nobel laureate.&nbsp; It is not a reassuring picture, nor is it
    reassuring that van den Bosch has been answered, if at all, by
    ridicule, personal abuse, and whispering.&nbsp; I draw the curtain of
    diplomacy over wherever these thoughts may lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Moral authority or not, there are questions of
    efficiency and expedition.&nbsp; The mills of EPA may or may not grind
    exceeding fine, but they do grind exceedingly slowly.&nbsp; Since 1972
    EPA has arrived at suspending only 79 active ingredients.&nbsp; Most of
    its "reregistration" reviews are still in some interim stage.&nbsp;
    Apparently industry advances new toxins much faster than EPA reviews
    them, so the inventory of pending reviews can only grow.&nbsp; </small><br>
&nbsp;
    <small></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">g.&nbsp; The case for
"proper
    pricing of inputs" is
    most persuasive when we can show that everything else in the system is
    working right first, as the optimal background we are to avoid
    distorting.&nbsp; But that is conspicuously untrue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> </strong></span><strong>...
    </strong></small><br>
    </div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small>In fact, land use decisions are
    superimposed on a
    settlement pattern based on massive market failure in land.&nbsp; The
    phenomena rather imprecisely called "land speculation" and "absentee
    ownership" betray market failure; and no one disputes there is massive
    regulatory failure in pricing and subsidizing transportation, which in
    turn determine land rents and values.&nbsp; Result: the land market is
    not efficient; land is not properly priced and allocated to begin
    with.&nbsp; This is the thread I will follow, although it may run afoul
    of The Great Secular Superstition.&nbsp;</small>&nbsp; </span><small><big>

    Land Value Taxation </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The process of monitoring and assessing LVT itself leads to a
    more
    subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
    prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
    used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
    employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
    pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
    wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
    planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
    LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
    that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
    charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
    objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
    wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently,
    many natural resources are almost assigned a worthless value because,
    not entering the mainstream marketplace, they usually have no $ tags
    hanging off them - hence the existence of externalities whereby the
    environment is plundered as near worthless.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So
    even wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
    better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
    effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>One way or another, it is necessary to quantify and prioritise
    the real
    value (in a broad sense) of natural resources to better account for
    economic externalities. In the end, only if a prospective resource user
    is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising land and other natural
    resources will resource extraction or development go ahead. The
    intrinsic nature of the LVT assessment process considerably assists in
    such cost estimation.</small><br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT's foundation of detailed
    land use
    assessments will also help expose the true costs of subsidies for
    natural resources, which effectively amount to negative eco-taxes.</span>
    Subsidies come in all shapes and sizes, often barely visible, and
    urgently need to be exposed and evaluated. Even some harmful subsidies
    which are labeled land taxes have nothing to do with genuine LVT. Banks
    gives the example of a Brazilian tax which was levied on unimproved
    land but was reduced by up to 90% on land used for crops or pasture.
    Forests were classified as unimproved land and were therefore taxed at
    the full rate, which induced settlers to chop down the trees to reduce
    their tax liability." ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
    corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
    and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
    even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
    power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport

    trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to

    privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
    compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
    in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
    legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;

    <small>Rentiers become the elite or rise higher up among the upper

    techno-advance that spurs a new monopoly and pushes up locational
    values. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
    </strong><br>
    <small>Meanwhile, ignoring our common assets guarantees that we
    continue to
    pay rent rather than begin to receive rent. Conversely, insisting upon
    a fair share could <span style="font-weight: bold;">win us the world
    we want</span>. While it breaks an old habit to leave jobs behind in
    favour of fair distribution, just recognizing surplus empowers people.
    It reaffirms the very existence of our commonwealth and challenges the
    narrow view of property as exclusively private. While the Left gets
    excoriated for wanting to be big spenders, demanding a dividend in lieu
    of waste and a shift of taxes from individual effort to social surplus
    helps refurbish the Left&#8217;s image.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The call to share the commonwealth enjoys an unshakable moral
    base and
    gets high marks for real world success, unlike taxes upon true
    earnings. Once implemented, sharing rent will grant us leisure &#8211; time
    enough to evolve and reconnect with friends, family, and neighbours &#8211;
    and drain away fortunes rather than let the fortunate continue to soak
    society. Hence support for shifting taxes and paying dividends to the
    citizenry grows already, without the Left&#8217;s leadership. It&#8217;s time to
    run with the banner of an extra income for everyone, in the halls and
    capitols of governments everywhere. To liberate humans from exploitive
    labor, let us advance the sharing of society&#8217;s surplus. <a

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
    stay rich, some of us can develop
    land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
    especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
    they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
    city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
    than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
    resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
    not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
    -- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
    designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
    our civilization, and our

    our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
    to the
    public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
    that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
    and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
    and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
    favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
    automobile. <strong>...

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the

"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides charging what privileges
    are worth, government should also
    replace license with responsibility ("internalize the
    externalities"). To temper the temptation to use lands both fragile
    and valuable, society could impose surcharges - an Ecology Security
    Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and fines when
    users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
    would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from
    land titles is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each
    phase of such a revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its
    own way. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Geonomics draws its power to
    predict and fix what ails economies
    by being grounded in reality. It holds to the notion that economies
    are not apart from but part of the embracing eco-system. As part of
    whole, economies self-regulate by the same natural feedback loops.
    The prey/predator cycle is mimicked by the pricing cycle, also known
    as the <b>Law of Supply and Demand</b>. This familiar pattern is

    (3)&nbsp; Getting less rent, people work more. <br>
    (4) More output raises site values and swells the rent-share. <br>
    (1) Again, ad infinitum. </small></blockquote>
    <small></small></blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, production is put into
    balance with consumption and work
    with play. Geonomics yields a policy that's not at war with but
    aligned with nature as model. Perhaps the most central feature of
    economics is price. Price is to production what DNA is to
    reproduction, the guides to growth. Rather than distort price with
    taxes and subsidies, with license (so-called "externalities") and
    rent-retention, geonomics respects the integrity of price, allowing
    it to accurately reflect our costs and values, by sharing rent. Then
    economies ("geonomies") can operate without the deadweight losses of
    taxation and rent seeking.</small><small>...&nbsp; <a

    Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
    </a>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...
    The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
    configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
    preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
    have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
    vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
    centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
    by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
    farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
    value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
    total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
    Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
    reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
    of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
    Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
    <small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
    contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
    transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
    only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
    rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
    transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
    greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
    the full burden of that travel.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>This relationship has been demonstrated more empirically in a
    recent
    study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
    Portland Oregon,</small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
      <p><small>each additional mile [traveled]
      translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
      locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
      difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
      in new home value.</small></p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>For a household in which one
    worker
    drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
    ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
    days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
    non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
    the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
    higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
    saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
    </span></small></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small>That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten
    miles.
    If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
    some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
    that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
    Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
    annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span>
    The American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000
    miles in 2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span></small> Even
    that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
    on to society. One study calculated that the total costs of motor
    vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
    our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small> In
    1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
    costs to society were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span></small> put
    another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
    vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span></small></small><br>
    <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
    <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>The
    latter figures include externalities like pollution and the costs
    of highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their
    engines so they pollute less, inflate their tires properly, and drive
    more safely are not likely to change the reality that people are
    forgetful and fallible.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>

    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by
    Pricing:
    Increasing the Recovery of Transportation Service Costs</span></small><br>
    <small>With respect to charges upon transportation services and
    externalities,
    there are several components to a proper pricing design.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(25)</span></small> The
    first step to proper pricing is to identify the proportion of
    transportation services that ought rightly to be seen as private goods
    as opposed to public goods.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(26)</span></small>
    Although this is a daunting task, the frequent figure used is 80
    percent - 20 percent proportion. </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>The public good proportion of road use
    reflects the amount of reliance by services provided by the government
    and associated agencies like mail service, national defense, public
    safety (ambulance, police and fire departments), and so on. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The private
    use of the roads constitutes the overwhelming amount of its use. This
    means that as a rule 80 percent of the highway use charges should be
    paid by individual drivers, directly or indirectly.

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
              transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
              concepts: access and mobility.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
            on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993
            study calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to
            our society equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product
            (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The study
            concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
            are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
            a total of $1.2
            to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
            represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
            by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its
            transportation requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because
            not all externalities are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
            user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs
            to society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
            another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor
            vehicle use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance
            is paid by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all
            but the marginal out-of-pocket operating costs. ...</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles.
              If the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some
              $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much
              (and likely more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs
              along with other experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
              American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles
              in 2001 cost 51 cents per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This
              figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not the additional costs
              passed on to society.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs
              of highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their
              engines so that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive
              more safely are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful
              and fallible. Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive
              to participate in this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon
              dioxide, and ozone are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific
              fact. Despite frequent headlines about replacing the internal combustion
              engine, all the realistic substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel
              power, solar-powered cars are far in the future, if at all, and also fail
              to deal with any transition. And every person driving his or her own car
              multiplies the probabilities of accidents. When people step into a car,
              they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the direct pecuniary costs
              of driving increase in any substantial way, there will surely be significant
              changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation choices. As
              will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them to private
              personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays its own
              way. ...</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Command-and-Control Measures</strong></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> Policymakers have two modes of leverage by
      which to implement public will: 1) so-called command-and-control approaches
      that are typically enforced
            by what state and federal constitutions group under &quot;police powers&quot; and
            2) fiscal approaches that typically involve a variety of taxes, fees, fines,
            and other charges that derive constitutionally from either police powers
            or &quot;tax powers.&quot; When governments administer either of
            these powers, they are legitimate and authoritative. Fiscal measures
            available
            to governments can come from either ground. The charges that the
            private sector usually impose differ in that they usually are responsive
            to market
            forces. Prices that are established by government, however, are not
            necessarily responsive to market forces, nor are they intended to
            be. Rather, they
            are set in order to accomplish specific public policy goals.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19] </em></strong></font>They
            can be no less efficient, however, when responsibly instituted.</div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"><font size="-1">19. One recent exploration of this is a chapter titled &quot;Catalytic
                  Government: Steering Rather Than Rowing,&quot; in Reinventing Government:

  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Governments face the challenge of knowing
      which of the tools at their disposal &#8212; command-and-control approaches or &quot;pricing&quot; approaches &#8212; will
            best serve effective and efficient achievement of public policies. Only
            in recent years, however, has there been a renewed interest in fiscal levers
            to achieve goals that policymakers seek to achieve. There is particular
            interest among students of welfare economics in incorporating costs earlier
            regarded as externalities, especially in designing environmental policies.
            Moreover, the use of pricing approaches to recover costs of government
            services that have a high level of private good about them can bring about
            more attractive and achievable goals than reliance on conventional police
            power approaches. User fees, environmental fees, and other such fiscal
            tools have become more fascinating &#8212; at least to students of public
            policy &#8212; than conventional taxes.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The renewed interest in fiscal approaches comes in recognition of the
            fact that traditional command-and-control approaches have not been successful.
            Government authority is far more effective at prohibiting and controlling
            than it is inducing and channeling.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> Three
            illustrations of failed command-and-control approaches will demonstrate
            this: zoning, urban growth boundaries, and altering (usually expanding)
            political jurisdictions. ...</div>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl
            development are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The
            equilibrium of forces can be restored in two ways: </div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation
              to users and <br>
              2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                    is really the socially created value. </div>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost:
              capital investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental
              externalities, and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different
              treatment with respect to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered
              by recapturing the land rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is
              socially created value, which is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure
              investment than allowing it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders
              to property close by. User fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor
              fuel and tire wear, serve as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be
              designed to be commensurate with use. As the wear and tear of roads as
              well as police patrol, snow and ice control, and signaling all involve
              operating and maintenance costs, such charges are easily linked with benefits
              received. In the future, still more accurate systems of service charges
              are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong, and New Zealand are already
              reliant on electronic devices that record road use by time, place, and
              vehicle weight.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
            and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with
            the costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom,
            it is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any
            projected level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs
            can be linked to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline
            consumption, to the full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and
            other environmental ambiences. Congestion costs, the last of the major
            components of a pricing design for highway use, are partially paid for
            by the time loss of those caught in traffic. The costs of time lost due
            to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the average driver spent 62
            hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68 billion in gas and
            time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours stalled in
            traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
            times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22
            minutes one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average
            in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But not
            all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
            time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people
            to impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being
            explored in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway
            space. In a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a
            form of land rent. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></div>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the funny thing is, you don't really believe it
          yourself," says Vernon. "You aren't being consistent. You say goods and
          services that we produce belong to the producers and no one else. But
          you support the income tax and the sales tax. Those taxes take away
          from the producer, without his or her consent, part of what he or she
          produced. So it doesn't seem that you really believe your own claims.
          Why should people support the Polluter Pays Principle that says they
          are stuck with negative products they produce, when at the same time
          you wouldn't allow them to keep the positive products they produce?
          Sounds like an uneven deal."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara is shocked. But she has to admit Vernon
          has a
          point. "Hmm, I guess this might be part of why the Polluter Pays
          Principle doesn't excite as much support as it should. If we lived in a
          world where people get to keep the full value of whatever their labor
          and their investment yields, then pollution would stand out in sharp
          contrast, as a crime against innocent people and their property. The
          Polluter Pays Principle would be totally obvious then."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And instead," says Vernon, "we're surrounded
          by
          cases of theft by income tax, by sales tax, and so on. Well then, no
          wonder people aren't shocked when the Polluter Pays Principle isn't
          applied. And no wonder some people don't even see the wisdom of it. "</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line question is this -- can a

    <div style="text-align: left;">Once a detailed land rent map has been created, one of the uses to which it
      can be put is to determine appropriate prices for activities that affect the
      rental value of surrounding land. For example, if the bidders for land include
      a negative adjustment for proximity to a factory that pollutes the air, then
      it is possible to determine, from the bids, how much greater land rents would
      be if the pollution were terminated. This amount can rightly be charged to
      the factory. Similarly, if the bidders include a positive adjustment for proximity
      to a private parking garage in a commercial district, it is possible to compute
      the amount that the presence of the parking garage adds to total rents. To
      motivate people to undertake an efficient amount of the activities with such
      positive effects, they should receive the addition to rent thus generated.

        3.0 &#8212; Chapter 1: Time to Upgrade (pages 3-14)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>More than a century ago, English economist John Ruskin observed that
        the same economic system that creates glittering wealth also spawns what
        he called illth &#8212; poverty, pollution, despair, illness. It makes
        life comfortable for some, but does so at considerable discomfort to
        others.</p>
      <p>Modern economists&#8217; term for illth is negative externalities. By
        this they mean the costs of economic transactions that are &#8220;external&#8221; to
        the parties involved. The classic example is a factory that dumps effluent
        into a river. Unlike homeowners who pay for garbage pickup, the factory&#8217;s
        owners pay nothing for disposing their waste into the river. But humans
        and other creatures living downstream do pay a cost. Plants and animals
        suffer and die, while cities have to build expensive treatment plants.
        From the standpoint of the factory owner, none of this matters. But from
        the standpoints of nature and society, these are negative externalities.
        (There can, sometimes, be positive externalities &#8212; for example,
        if your neighbor repaints her house, that may increase the value of yours.)</p>
      <p>For a long time, economists assured us that the wealth spewed out by
        our economic machine was so great, and the illth so trivial, that we
        didn&#8217;t need to worry about negative externalities. If this was
        ever true, it&#8217;s assuredly true no longer. Contemporary climate
        change is, quintessentially, a problem of negative externalities. We
        pay owners of land beneath which fossil fuels lie. We pay drillers, refiners,
        transporters, and retailers. But we don&#8217;t pay nature, or anyone
        else, for dumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. We shift this
        cost to our children, and take a free ride. We party, they pay.</p>
      <p>What&#8217;s more, many negative externalities aren&#8217;t even the
        result of meeting genuine human needs. The word thneed doesn&#8217;t
        appear in any economics text, but it&#8217;s symbolic of our modern predicament.
        The word was coined by Theodor Geisel &#8212; better known as Dr. Seuss &#8212; in
        his children&#8217;s fable The Lorax. A thneed is a thing we want but
        don&#8217;t really need. As many parents will recall, The Lorax pits
        a dynamic entrepreneur (the Once-ler) against a pesky Lorax who &#8220;speaks
        for the trees.&#8221; The Once-ler makes thneeds by cutting down truffula
        trees. When the Lorax protests, the Once-ler replies:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>I&#8217;m being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.<br>
  A Thneed&#8217;s a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!</em></p>

      <p>Economists have no technical term for thneed; they assume that all &#8220;demand&#8221; in
        the economy is equivalent, as long as it&#8217;s backed with money. Yet
        surely it would be helpful to differentiate. One can imagine an axis
        running from needs to thneeds. On one end are such things as food, shelter,
        basic transportation, and health care. On the other end are Coca-Cola,
        iPods, and Hummers. (Significantly, needs are generic, while thneeds
        are typically branded.) Filling needs contributes more to human well-being
        than does selling thneeds, yet our economic system increasingly devotes
        scarce resources to thneeds.</p>
      <p>Why do we have so much illth and so many thneeds? Because our economic
        operating system is far out of balance. On one side, representing owners
        of capital, are powerful profit-maximizing corporations. On the other
        side, representing future generations, nonhuman species, and millions
        of humans with unmet needs, are &#8212; almost nothing. The system lacks
        institutions that preserve shared inheritances, charge corporations for
        degrading nature, or boost the &#8220;demanding&#8221; power of people
        whose basic needs are ignored. Hence the system generates ever more illth,
        waste, and ever-widening disparities between rich and poor. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      <p>Enclosure, in which property rights are literally taken or given away,
        is half the reason for the commons&#8217; decline; the other half is
        a form of trespass called externalizing &#8212; that is, shifting costs
        to the commons. Externalizing is as relentless as enclosure, yet much
        less noticed, since it requires no active aid from politicians. It occurs
        quietly and continuously as corporations add illth to the commons without
        permission or payment.</p>
      <p>The one-two punch of enclosure and externalizing is especially potent.
        With one hand, corporations take valuable stuff from the commons and
        privatize it. With the other hand, they dump bad stuff into the commons
        and pay nothing. The result is profits for corporations but a steady
        loss of value for the commons. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their
        own self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being
        told what to do, and words like <em>statism</em> conjure fears of bureaucracy
        at best and tyranny at worst. By contrast, <em>privatism</em> connotes freedom.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative
        for saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private
        corporations, operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources
        efficiently but can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting
        aside some supplies for future generations &#8212; something neither
        markets nor corporations, when left to their own devices, will do. The
        reason lies in the algorithms and starting conditions of our current
        operating system.</p>
      <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
      <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
        is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take
        data from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and
        display the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
      <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
        a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior
        of the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
        system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The
        algorithms are:<br>
        (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
        (2) distribute property income on a per-share basis, and<br>
        <strong>(3) the price of nature equals zero.</strong><br>
        The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more
        property shares than the remaining 95 percent.</p>
      <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell
        as much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources,
        and waste disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses
        the minds of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake
        up thinking about how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their
        product, they must create some. If they work in finance, they worry about
        margins and leverage. If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain
        hard, replace long-term employees with temps, and shift jobs to places
        where wages are lower. All the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to
        Wall Street.</p>
      <p><strong>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s
        the combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism
        to devour nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time,
        nothing in the algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either
        individually or collectively, to preserve anything.</strong></p>
      <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think
        about protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving
        something back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for
        actually doing such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does
        it mean that, from time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly
        flout the corporate algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying
        is that, in the great majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and
        its brethren are obeyed. For all practical purposes, the publicly traded
        corporation is a slave to its algorithm. </p>
      <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
        One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that
          nature can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private
          property rights. This line of thought is called free market environmentalism,
          and it&#8217;s favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato
          Institute.</p>
      <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential
        paper by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960,
        Coase challenged the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation
        is the only way to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be
        protected through property rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined
        and the cost of enforcing them is low.</p>
      <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a
        polluter and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance,
        if the polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not
        to be emitted upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will
        come to a deal that reduces pollution.</p>
      <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
        air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid
        such potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a
        sum of money up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation
        for the inconvenience and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree
        on a level of pollution and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
      <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute,
        the pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
        This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than
        the polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language
        of economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another
        matter.) It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities
        have been internalized.</p>
      <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
        It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
        is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with
        page after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property
        rights and let markets handle the rest.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
        Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my
        mind, a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and
        society as a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for
        managers to do will get done, and often quickly, while things that are
        complicated may never get done. Right now, we need to get our economic
        activity in harmony with nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the
        lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s easiest for managers to act when
        they have prices, then let&#8217;s give them prices, not regulations
        and exhortations.</p>
      <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
        First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights
        to nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will
        be the same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this
        may be true in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s
        pocketbooks whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
      <p><strong>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be
          given free to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of
        pollution is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking
        the opposite tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural
        Resources Defense Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing
        on common property and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought
        to end.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign
          property rights when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by
          everyone? </strong>It
        turns out this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s
        no textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
        I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
        Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
        In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
        different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new
        property rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a
        long time, it behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>Thus far I&#8217;ve argued that Capitalism 2.0 &#8212; or surplus capitalism &#8212; has
        three tragic flaws: it devours nature, widens inequality, and fails to
        make us happier in the end. It behaves this way because it&#8217;s programmed
        to do so. It <strong>must</strong> make thneeds, reward property owners
        disproportionately, and distract us from truer paths to happiness because
        its algorithms direct it to do so. Neither enlightened managers nor the
        occasional zealous regulator can make it behave much differently.</p>
      <p>In this part of the book I advance a solution. The essence of it is
        to fix capitalism&#8217;s operating system by adding a commons sector
        to balance the corporate sector. The new sector would supply virtuous
        feedback loops and proxies for unrepresented stakeholders: future generations,
        pollutees, and nonhuman species. And would offset the corporate sector&#8217;s <em>negative</em> externalities
        with <em>positive</em> externalities of comparable magnitude. If the
        corporate sector devours nature, the commons sector would protect it.
        If the corporate sector widens inequality, the commons sector would reduce
        it. If the corporate sector turns us into self-obsessed consumers, the
        commons sector would reconnect us to nature, community, and culture.
        All this would happen automatically once the commons sector is set up.
        The result would be a balanced economy that gives us the best of both
        sectors and the worst of neither. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      <blockquote>
        <p>&#8220;Let us suppose,&#8221; economist Ronald Coase wrote in 1960, &#8220;that
          a farmer and a cattle-raiser are operating on neighboring properties.&#8221; He
          went on to suppose further that the cattle-raiser&#8217;s animals wander
          onto the farmer&#8217;s land and damage his crops. From this hypothetical
          starting point Coase examined the problem of externalities and proposed
          a solution &#8212; the creation of rights to pollute or not be polluted
          upon. Today, pollution rights are used throughout the world. In effect,
          Coase conjured into existence a class of property rights that didn&#8217;t
          exist before, and his leap of imagination eventually reduced real pollution.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Let us suppose&#8221; is a wonderful way for anyone, economists
          included, to begin thinking. It lets us adjust old assumptions and
          see what might happen. And it lets us imagine things that don&#8217;t
          exist but could, and sometimes, because we imagined them, later do.</p>
        <p>Coase supposed that a single polluter or his neighboring pollutee
          possessed a right to pollute or not be polluted upon. He further supposed
          that the transaction costs involved in negotiations between the two
          neighbors were negligible. He made these suppositions half a century
          ago, at a time when aggregate pollution wasn&#8217;t planet-threatening,
          as it now is. Given today&#8217;s altered reality, it might be worth
          updating Coase&#8217;s suppositions to make them relevant to this aggregate
          problem. Here, in my mind, are the appropriate new suppositions:</p>
        <p> * Instead of one polluter, there are many, and instead of one pollutee,
          there are millions &#8212; including many not yet born.<br>
  * The pollutees (including future generations) are collectively represented
  by trusts.<br>
  * The initial pollution rights are assigned by government to these trusts.<br>
  * In deciding how many pollution permits to sell, the trustees&#8217; duty
  isn&#8217;t to maximize revenue but to preserve an ecosystem for future generations.
  The trusts therefore establish safe levels of pollution and gradually reduce
  the number of permits they sell until those levels are reached.<br>
  * Revenue from the sale of pollution permits is divided 50 percent for per
  capita dividends (like the Alaska Permanent Fund) and 50 percent for public
  goods such as education and ecological restoration.</p>
        <p>If we make these suppositions, what then happens? We have, first of
          all, an economic model with a second set of books. Not all, but many
          externalities show up on these new ledgers. More importantly, we begin
          to imagine a world in which nature and future generations are represented
          in real-time transactions, corporations internalize previously externalized
          costs, prices of illth-causing goods rise, and everyone receives some
          property income.</p>
        <p>Here&#8217;s what such a world could look like:</p>
        <p> * Degradation of key ecosystems is gradually reduced to sustainable
          levels because the trustees who set commons usage levels are accountable
          to future generations, not living shareholders or voters. When they
          fail to protect their beneficiaries, they are sued.<br>
  * Thanks to per capita dividends, income is recycled from overusers of key
  ecosystems to underusers, creating both incentives to conserve and greater
  equity.<br>
  * Clean energy and organic farming are competitive because prices of fossil
  fuels and agricultural chemicals are appropriately high.<br>
  * Investment in new technologies soars and new domestic jobs are created because
  higher fuel and waste disposal prices boost demand for clean energy and waste
  recycling systems.<br>
  * Public goods are enhanced by permit revenue.</p>
        <p>What has happened here? We&#8217;ve gone from a realistic set of assumptions
          about how the world is &#8212; multiple polluters and pollutees, zero
          cost of pollution, dangerous cumulative levels of pollution &#8212; to
          a reasonable set of expectations about how the world could be if certain
          kinds of property rights are introduced. These property rights go beyond
          Coase&#8217;s, but are entirely compatible with market principles.
          The results of this thought experiment show that the introduction of
          common property trusts can produce a significant and long-lasting shift
          in economic outcomes without further government intervention. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
