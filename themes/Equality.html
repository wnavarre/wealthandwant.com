<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural.  Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of the citizen, and  political organization always starts from this base. It is as social  development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make  the many the slaves of the few. How this is we may see. In all  institutions which involve the lodgment of governing power there is,  with social growth, a tendency to the exaltation of their function and  the centralization of their power, and in the stronger of these  institutions a tendency to the absorption of the powers of the rest.  Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government the business  of a special class. And as numbers increase and the power and  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all,  so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny  and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head  man of a little village, can command or govern only by common consent,  and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his fellows. But when a  tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a populous country,  the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition, become  practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to  appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes  irresistible as against individuals. <strong>And gradually, as power thus  concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of thought grows  up which regards the masses as born but for the service of their rulers.</strong> <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This right of private possession
in things created by God is,
however, very different from the right of private ownership in things
produced by labor. The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in
cases when the dictate of self-preservation may terminate all other
rights. The purpose of the one, the exclusive possession of land, is
merely to secure the other, the exclusive ownership of the products of
labor; and it can never rightfully be carried so far as to impair or
deny this. <span style="font-weight: bold;">While anyone may hold
exclusive possession of land so far as
it does not interfere with the equal rights of others, he can
rightfully hold it no further.</span></small></p>

since no one comes into the world without God's permission, his
presence attests his equal right to the use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them
to refuse him any use of the earth which they had divided between them
would therefore be for them to commit murder. And for them to refuse
him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them or by giving
them part of the products of his labor he bought It of them, would be
for them to commit theft.&nbsp;

increase &#8211; tends, with the advance of civilisation, to make the share
that goes equally to each member of society more and more important as
compared with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and thus
to make the advance of civilisation lessen relatively the differences
that in a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the
weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate?<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Does it not show the purpose
of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilisation should be
an advance, not merely to larger powers, but to a greater and greater

it &#8211; an advance towards a more and more monstrous inequality?</span></small></p>

  <p>THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

    MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend to advance in proportion
    to the mental power expended in progression &#8212; the mental power which
    is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

            <br>
To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress through the water will not depend
upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted to propelling her.
This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for baling, or any
expenditure of force in fighting among themselves or in pulling in different
directions. <br>
            <br>
Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the first
essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater the possibilities
of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict becomes
greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an equality of rights
is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice) is the second essential of
progress. <br>
            <br>
Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees mental
power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law) prevents
the dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

it may be called. And the Author may be justly styled - The Euclid of

with the Land Question. He has given us a true base line -- man&#8217;s equal
right to the raw material of the earth, to the air, to the water, to
the rays of the sun, and all natural products -- from which we can work
out any problem, and by which we can test the &#8220;title and measure&#8221; of
every man&#8217;s property. Resting on this baseline -- man&#8217;s natural rights
-- he represents to us the perpendicular line of man's right to labour,
&#8220;with security of reaping its full produce and just reward.&#8221; Here we
have the question in a nutshell. Take away the base line, and you have
no right to labour, and no produce or reward, except what may be meted
out by the usurper of your natural rights. You have to beg for leave to
toil! We thus see clearly how the robbery of labour may be prevented,
and how impossible it is to put a stop to such robbery while the
industrial classes neglect to claim and exercise their natural right --
their right to an equal share in the earth, and all its natural

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is perfectly clear that we
are all here with equal rights to
the use of the universe. We are all here equally entitled to the use
of land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>How can we secure that equal right? Not by the dividing up of
land
equally; that in the present stage of civilisation is utterly
impossible. Equality could not be secured in that way, nor could it
be maintained. The ideal way, the way which wise men, desirous of
according to each his equal right, would resort to in a new country,
would be to treat the land as the property of the whole, to allow
individuals to possess and to use it, paying for the whole a proper
rent for any superiority in the piece of land they were using. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the
rent is large or small is not of importance to the principle. I would
take rent &#8211; always meaning by rent economic rent &#8211; for the
community because it belongs to the community. (Cheers.) I would not
abolish it; I would exact it from anyone who used land wherever it
was used; because that is the only way in which all can be put upon
an equality. (Hear, hear.)
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If you are to leave to the man who
gets
possession of a piece of land in the centre of London the whole rent
you give him an enormous advantage over the man who for his purposes,
to get his land, has to go to some out of the way district or up to
the Highlands of Scotland. (Hear, hear.) 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The importance that we
attribute to this taking of rent is that it is not merely taking that
much from a source that will not restrict industry, will not oppress
labour, will not hamper production; but it will make mere
landownership utterly valueless. (Applause.) By taking the rent 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>we
make it unprofitable to hold land in expectation of future increase
in its value. (Cheers.) 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>We make it impossible to extort from the
worker a monopoly rent (Hear, hear.) 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>We make it impossible for great
landowners to hold vast tracts of land &#8211; which their fellow
citizens would be glad to make fruitful &#8211; in idleness or for
purposes of pleasure. (Loud cheers.) 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tax land values up to the full
and what would you have? The land that has no value, that is to say,
the land that two men do not want to use could be had by labour not
merely without price, but without tax. The selling value of land
would be destroyed, and all that the user of land need pay would be a
price amounting to the special advantage that he had above his
fellows by the possession and use of a particular piece of land.&nbsp;
..</small><br>
<br>
<small>Mr Hyndman speaks of the history of
the development of England. What is the history of the development of
England? It is the gradual suppression of the common rights &#8211;
the gradual making of private property out of what was originally
recognised as common property. (Hear, hear.) It is the gradual taking
of the land of England from the whole people, and making the class
originally tenants landowners. (Hear; hear.) The long series of
usurpations was finally consummated by a no-rent manifesto, by which
the landowning class live off the rents they had agreed to pay for
the use of land, and put them in indirect taxes upon labour.
(Cheers.) What we propose to do is to go back the same way. What we
single tax men would do would be to go back to the old system, to
bring it back in a way adapted to our time; to recognise, not
half-heartedly, but fully, that all men are equally entitled to the
use of the land, and its correlative that each man is absolutely
entitled to that which his labour produces. (Applause.)&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The right of property does not
rest upon human laws; they have
often ignored and violated it. It rests on natural laws -- that is to

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But who made the earth that any

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
    offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
    so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
    to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
    asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
    ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of
      nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes,
      as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. ...</p>
  <p>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man
      to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. This
      is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from the
      masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
      a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed;
      that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon
      transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe forbid
      it. ...</p>
  <p>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her, if we trust
      Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear, the forces
      that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation. Think of the powers now
      wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
      of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> With want destroyed;</li>
    <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
    <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
      jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
    <li> with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
    <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung and
      high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which
    has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw
    whose
      eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the
      City of God on earth, with its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl!
      It is the reign of the Prince of Peace! <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">We believe that the

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For some opportunities this
principle is widely recognized. An
example would be the allocation of off-shore oil drilling rights. No
one says that governments should decide how much drilling rights each
oil company deserves, and pass the rights out without charge. It is
recognized that the value of these rights ought to accrue to the
public treasury, and any company that extracts the oil should be
obliged to pay, through an <span style="font-weight: bold;">auction</span>,
what the rights it exercises
would have been worth to some other oil company. We believe that this

rights.</span> <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The US Census Bureau reports that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the number of Americans living below the
poverty line</span> jumped by 1.3 million to 35.9 million or 12.5
percent of the population last year.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a significant lack of
decent affordable housing in the United States.</span>
The growing gap between wage earnings and the cost of housing leaves
millions of families and individuals unable to make ends meet.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economic Research Service of the United States Department of
Agriculture released its annual report on <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">household food security</span>
for 2002. It was no surprise given the recent increases in poverty that
hunger and food insecurity rose for the third year in a row. A food
insecure household is defined as a household which faces limited or
uncertain availability of food. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The wealth gap is increasing in
the
US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the
population has $2 trillion more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the
suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
$582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
    </small></li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The idea that natural
opportunities are everyone's common heritage
is often defended with religious language. John Locke said:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Whether we consider
natural reason, which tells us that men, being once born, have a right
to their preservation, and consequently to meat and drink, and such
other things as nature affords for their sustenance, or revelation,
which gives us an account of those grants God made of the world to
Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, 'tis very clear that God, as King
David says, Psal. CXV. xvi. has given the Earth to the children of men,
given it to mankind in common.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>

value taxation. Writing in about
1690, he said that there was so much unclaimed land in America that
no one could properly complain about the private appropriation of
land in Europe.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font>
Writing nearly
200 year later, when it was becoming impossible for people to
appropriate good unclaimed land in America, Henry George said: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>If we are all here by the
equal permission of the creator, we are all here with an equal title to
the enjoyment of his bounty -- with an equal right to the use of all
that nature so impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and
inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human being as he
enters the world, and which during his continuance in the world can be
limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can
rightfully make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing
men were to unite to grant away their equal rights, they could not
grant away the right of those who follow them.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>4</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George preceded this argument with
a psychological and linguistic
one. He said that our conception of property, of a right of exclusive
possession, is based on the idea that each person has a right to his
or her productive powers, and therefore to what he or she produces.
Since no one produced land, no one can properly claim to own
it.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>5</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This psychological and linguistic
argument is not entirely
convincing. It seems clear that humans, like other species, have an
impulse toward the appropriation and defense of territory. Natural
selection has worked in favor of those who are skilled in
appropriating natural opportunities and deterring others from
encroaching on them. It seems possible that, as a way of limiting
violence, humans have merged an idea of ownership based on production
with an idea of ownership based on the ability to appropriate
territory and deter encroachment.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this is the social and
biological reality, then there is a
different argument for treating natural opportunities as everyone's
common heritage.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Much
more credible is a statement of the form, "<b>We will share
equally the value of natural opportunities that might be
appropriated</b>." This is the potential of land value taxation: to
provide a framework in which the value of natural opportunities will
be shared equally, both as an expression of the idea that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities, and as a formula whose
potential to remove the motive for future aggression is greater than
that of enshrining the status quo of any particular year. And in
addition, land value taxation is one way of achieving allocative
efficiency with respect to a wide variety of public issues.&nbsp; </small><small><b>... </b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed?<strong> ...</strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair? <strong>... 
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The fairness of such a tax system might also be questioned
from
another perspective. If people are required to pay the costs of the
public services that they use, then who will pay for schools?</small></p>
<p><small>There are two possible answers. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>One possibility is that people will agree on the value of
living in a community where children are well educated, whether they
have children or not, and they will find the presence of another child
in the community to be a benefit for which the cost of educating the
child is not too high a price to pay. In this case, educational
expenditures add to the value of land throughout the community, and
education can be financed efficiently by land taxes, without requiring
students or their parents to pay. Those who pay will be receiving
benefits that are equal to what they pay. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second possibility is that there will be a consensus
that, whether anyone wants to pay or not, education is a birthright of
all children. In this case, the birthright can be financed efficiently
by a tax on land, since land does not leave town or work less hard when
it is taxed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>But is such a tax fair? Consider first a case in which
everyone
has the same number of children. Then the taxation of land value to
finance education is equivalent to the assertion of an equal claim of
everybody to land. And there is a good basis for such a claim. No one
made the land. The titles to land that we recognize today generally
originated in conquest. Our affection for the words of the
Declaration of Independence, that "All men are created equal," in
conjunction with the recognition that titles to land are privileges
that are created by government, should lead us to the implication
that we have an obligation to share the benefits of land equally. As
Henry George pointed out (1960 [1879], 403-407), the sensible
way to assert equal rights to land is not to divide the land equally,
but rather to collect the rent of land and use it for public
purposes. A tax on land takes for public purposes only what nature,
public services, and the growth of communities produce, unlike taxes
on labor and capital, which take what people produce and which people
may properly resent having taken from them. Thus, at least when
everyone has the same number of children, it is fair to finance
education by taxing land.</small></p>
<p><small>Now consider how the situation changes when people have
different
numbers of children. Consider two possibilities.</small> </p>
<ul>
  <li><small>First, it is possible that additional children provide a
benefit to everyone in society, because the number of persons with whom
everyone can interact will be greater. If this benefit is as large as
the cost of education, then there is no unfairness in paying for the
education of all children from public funds. </small></li>
  <li><small>On the other hand if the birth of an additional child does
not provide general benefits as large as the cost of educating the
child, or if it generates crowding costs, then people who have more
children than average can rightfully be required to pay those costs.</small>  </li>
</ul>
<p><small>"But wait!" you may say. "Many people will not be able to
afford
to pay the cost of educating their children. How can you expect them
to do so?" </small></p>
<p><small>I would like to turn the question around. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If people cannot be
expected to pay for educating the children that they ought to be able
to have, doesn't that mean that there is some fundamental unfairness
in the starting conditions? Is it not the combination of past
injustice and current unequal access to natural opportunities that
makes us reluctant to require people to pay the full costs of having
children?</span> In my conception of justice, we have not adequately
compensated for past injustice until we have put people in a position
where we are content to oblige them to pay the full costs of their
choices. </small></p>
<p><small>But there is another potential inequality that needs to be
addressed.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> What if different
communities have different amounts of
land value per person?</span> Here a distinction in sources of land
value
must be made. If a community has higher land value because it has
built itself into a wonderful place, then it should be allowed to
keep that value for itself. On the other hand, if a community has a
higher-than-average natural endowment per citizen, then it owes
something to communities with lower-than-average natural endowment
per citizen. A program of payments among communities to equalize
natural endowments per citizen will be both efficient and fair. It
will be efficient because in the absence of such a program, people
would gravitate to the communities with higher-than-average natural
endowments (like Alaska) even when it was socially uneconomic for
them to go there. It is fair because it accords with an equal right
of all to natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p><small>Thus just and efficient local taxation is achieved by the
combination of public collection of rent, marginal cost charges for
public services, and a program of transfers among communities to
equalize natural endowment per citizen. ...<a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land For The People</a> -- speech, 1889<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We start out with these two
principles, which I think are clear and
self-evident: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>that which a man makes belongs to him and
can by him be given or
sold to anyone that he pleases <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small>
  <li><small>But that which existed before man came
upon the earth, that which
was not produced by man, but which was created by God -- that belongs
equally to all men. As no man made the land, so no man can claim a
right of ownership in the land. As God made the land, and as we know
both from natural perception and from revealed religion, that God the
Creator is no respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal,
so also do we know that He made this earth equally for all the human
creatures that He has called to dwell upon it.

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</span></small><br>
<small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
