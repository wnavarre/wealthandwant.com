<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take 10,000 per square mile as a
reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If their land is downzoned for
farming, open space, or habitat,
they regard it as a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">taking</span>,"
and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a case showing how this
works. The Los Angeles
Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
and condemned the land. The case
went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i>
to SP to help subsidize
mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
create in the future.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Later, MTA was to stint on subway
construction, resulting in
subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
<b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let's go back to those Channel
Islands in British Columbia, with
subsidized car-ferries. Naturally, as I said, these cheap ferries
attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for land there.
Developers and hopeful subdividers bid up land prices. This is not
what the old settlers had in mind: their environment is threatened,
including the habitat of endangered species. They appeal to the
Crown, which subsidizes their ferries, to help them preserve land for
habitat.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They want the government to buy
some of it, paying the high prices
created by the ferry subsidy, to keep it from use by people who might
use the ferries. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the government
would pay twice: to subsidize
the ferries, and then to retire the land at the high prices made
possible by the ferries. </span>Failing that, they want the Crown to
downzone most of it. The landowners are not charged when the ferries
raise their asking prices, but demand compensation when
downzoned.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here,
in microcosm, is the American problem with sprawl and
habitat. </span>Multiply that ferry subsidy a thousand times, and you
have
the Great American System of Public Works and Services for Private
Gain. First the public pays to bring urban demand to remote lands;
now the landowners, the spoiled children of the national family,
demand to be paid again for downzoning or selling that same land to
preserve habitat. They demand payment not to cash in on the
opportunities we just gave them free.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus far, it is true, the courts
have let us downzone without
compensating.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> However, now a storm has
gathered. Proposition 300, on
the ballot in Arizona, demands compensation for downzoning - it is
aimed at the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. There is
a movement in Congress to compensate for any Federal regulation that
devalues land by more than 50%.</span> It is led by Congressman Billy
Tauzin, a Democrat from Louisiana. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">You can imagine what a more
conservative Congress might do. Speculative landowners may soon get
everything they demand, leaving heavy debts to which their light tax
payments now contribute very little.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do we dig out from this
one? I'll repeat: go with the flow of
cutting public spending by cutting down subsidies to urban sprawl.
They are a major source of the problem. We'll never win the
environmental fight until those subsidies are withdrawn. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Those are the carrots. A
good stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there.</span><span

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>But LVT has much more to contribute to the question of
low-impact urban
function, in the form of affordable and efficient public transport and
other desirable infrastructure. The principle reason why public
transport options are presently so limited is because the
taxpayer-funded investment in this and other forms of infrastructure
effectively disappears, in an almost unseen manner, into the "Black
Hole" of landowners' pockets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not only is the
resulting
compact cityscape more amenable to the provision of public transport
(not to mention walking and riding), but LVT makes the investment in
such infrastructure affordable because the resulting enhanced land
values are "recycled" back into public coffers.</span> The extension of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">London's Jubilee line</span>
underground network, which opened in 1999, provides a good case in
point of how desirable infrastructure can be self-funding if land
values are recaptured. An independent study was performed which
assessed the increase in land values extending to 800 yards from each
of the 10 stations. The accumulated gain (to private landowners) was
estimated to be around &pound;13 billion, courtesy of the &pound;3.5
billion of
taxpayers funds it took to build the line! ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>A simple model will serve to illustrate. Presently, rail/metro
infrastructure is almost prohibitively expensive because the windfall
benefits are effectively handed over to landowners. To partially recoup
the outlay, authorities are forced to set fares so high as to act as a
disincentive to potential low-impact commuters.&nbsp; <a

    the brink of extinction. Even then, the courts don&#8217;t always enforce
    it. Recently, in a very dry year, the government reduced its delivery of

    to survive. Some farmers sued, arguing that the government had unconstitutionally &#8220;taken&#8221; their

<p>    Lindy Davies: <a href="../docs/Davies_Ownership.html">Ownership and
    the Law</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      President Bush's announcement of his vision for an "ownership society"
      met with thunderous cheers at the Republican Convention, and much
      eye-rolling elsewhere. The Bush Administration would like to start by
      encouraging private ownership of our retirement funds and our
      health-care decisions. They want to get the heavy hand of government
      out of such things and unleash the tremendous efficiency of millions
      upon millions of Self-Interested Individual Actors, the husky,
      brawling, broad-shouldered capitalism that made this country great.
      Prosperity depends on the security of private property and the potency
      of individual initiative! This is the self-evident truth that has been
      obscured by Hollywood Socialists, Democratic Girlie-men and purveyors
      of the Homosexual Agenda.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      We should realize, however, that this is hardly a new initiative. It is
      really just the latest wave of an argument that has raged throughout
      the history of the United States, about just what -- if anything -- and
      on what basis -- if any -- the government can require us to surrender
      what we possess. There are some people out there -- and actually a fair
      number, after all -- who don't view the Bush Administration's
      privatization proposals as extremist at all -- but, rather, too soft.
      <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Unfortunately, though, the law is not at all clear. Thomas Jefferson
      fudged the topic in the United States Declaration of Independence,
      inserting "the pursuit of happiness" where people expected the more
      loaded term "property". The Bill of Rights, however, is strong on
      property rights. It provides for security of "persons, houses, papers,
      and effects," that "private property shall not be taken for public use
      without just compensation" and that rights not specifically prohibited
      are reserved to the states or to the people. In fact, the US
      Constitution was so bullish on property that it provided for private
      property in human beings, a principle made explicit in Dred Scott vs.
      Sandford and many other cases. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Slavery was made unconstitutional by means of the 13th Amendment
      in
      1865. This, however, left much to be resolved, and the Congress had a
      very difficult job -- perhaps, in strictly logical terms, an impossible
      job -- in drafting Amendment number fourteen.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      The 14th amendment reaffirms the rights of life, liberty and property,
      and binds the states to the same due process and equal protection
      restrictions as the federal government. However, it places the
      Constitution's first limit on the right of property, stating that the
      United States or any state shall not pay "any claim for the loss or
      emancipation of any slave". This could be seen as somewhat fishy in
      terms of the Fifth Amendment. After all the 13th amendment had taken
      the slaveholders' property three years before. Had not the Supreme
      Court ruled that slaves were property and had to be returned to their
      owners, even if they escaped to non-slaveholding states?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Although it would have been impracticable (to say the least) to enforce
      the Takings Clause to the tune of the market value of some four million
      human beings, that was what the Constitution required the government to
      do.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      The next amendment to the Constitution following the Reconstruction
      Amendments was another milestone in the debate over property rights.
      The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, allows Congress to &#8220;lay and
      collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived&#8221; -- contravening
      the restriction of this practice that had been laid out in Article I.
      The &#8220;from whatever source derived&#8221; part has been making people scream
      bloody murder ever since. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      The original advocates of the income tax (many of them Single Taxers)
      sought to tax accumulation, not industry and initiative. They saw that
      the massive concentration of wealth among a privileged few was harmful
      to the nation, and they persuaded the states to accept a progressive
      tax that would compel robber barons to pay for public goods while
      letting entrepreneurs gain from their contributions to overall
      prosperity. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">And yet, over
      the years, a tax on income &#8220;from whatever
      source derived&#8221; came, one loophole at a time, to be a tax on exactly
      those productive, hardworking, middle-class people that it was designed
      to help. ... </span></small><br>

      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
      In most people's minds, after all, land is the most solid and important
      kind of property; in fact, the word "property" in general conversation
      most often means "land". However, it has long been recognized that
      sometimes privately-held land must be taken for public purposes. The
      principle of eminent domain is not (particularly) controversial. If the
      state wants to put a highway through your house, it must pay you the
      fair market value of your property.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>

      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
      This decision was important because it extended the Takings doctrine
      beyond physical seizure to the taking of value -- but it was also
      relatively uncontroversial in that the state legislature had removed
      all of the parcel's market value.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      If government were to be held liable for every single action that took
      away a portion of real estate value, it could scarcely do anything at
      all. That might be how some of the most strident militia-folk would
      like it. However, it would certainly not suit real estate owners in
      general -- who, while they might not enjoy paying for government, do
      benefit from the things that government does.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      What the property-rights folks are forgetting (or disregarding) is that
      if a piece of land has a market value, that means that the net benefits
      conferred upon it by the community (which includes the government) are
      greater than the net costs. Location value is far and away the most
      important component of land value -- and location value is almost
      entirely the result of services and infrastructure that the government
      provides. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      It's no accident that the issue of "regulatory takings" is such a stew
      of contradictions. Indeed, the terms of the argument deny the
      possibility of coherence (in much the same way as they did in 1868).
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is not the fruit of
      human labor, and its value is not the result
      of any actions taken by its owner. Therefore, private property in land
      is an entirely different sort of phenomenon than private property in
      the products of labor -- and as long as the law fails to recognize this
      fact, it cannot hope to make sense of the issue of "regulatory takings".</span>
      <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      It could be suggested that "the conditions of the grant" could, without
      doing any violence to the secure right of private property, require the
      payment to the community of the land's rental value, to cover the cost
      of the community's expenses which, it turn, provide the land's value in
      the first place. That would, of course, require a clearer definition of
      the moral basis of property that the United States has ever been able
      to come to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet -- think of
      it for a moment -- what would have happened
      if the original Bill of Rights had articulated the individual's
      absolute right to property only in the products of labor -- and the
      community's right to the community-created value of the land?</span></small><br>

      It would have saved us an awful lot of trouble. True, the "slavery"
      states would have balked at joining the union under those rules. But
      under them, the nation would have been so prosperous that they would
      quite soon have seen the advantage of joining. We would have avoided
      the Civil War, and probably even World War I -- it is dazzling to think
      about how different -- and vastly better -- our history would have
      been, had the Framers taken the brave step of setting forth the moral
      basis of property along these lines.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      It's interesting that we use the word "own" to mean two different
      things: the sense of possession, and the sense of personal
      acknowledgment, as in "owning up" to one's responsibilities. The
      relationship between the two was once closer than it now seems to be;
      the word "ought" is an archaic past participle of "owe". As we consider
      how to arrange our "ownership society", we'd do well to remember what
      we "ought" -- and bring the two senses of the word back together.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
