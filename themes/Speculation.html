    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 4: Land Speculation
    Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a cause, not yet adverted to, which must be taken into consideration
      fully to explain the influence of material progress upon the distribution of
      wealth.</p>
  <p>That cause is<strong> the confident expectation of the future enhancement
        of land values</strong>, which arises in all progressive countries from the steady increase
      of rent, and which leads to <strong>speculation</strong>, or the holding of land for a higher
      price than it would then otherwise bring.</p>
  <p>We have hitherto assumed, as is generally assumed in elucidations of the
    theory of rent, that the actual margin of cultivation always coincides with
    what may
      be termed the necessary margin of cultivation &#8212; that is to say, we
      have assumed that cultivation extends to less productive points only as
      it becomes
      necessary from the fact that natural opportunities are at the more productive
      points fully utilized.</p>
  <p>This, probably, is the case in stationary or very slowly progressing communities,
      but in rapidly progressing communities, where the swift and steady increase
      of rent gives confidence to calculations of further increase, it is not
    the case. In such communities, the confident expectation of increased prices
    produces,
      to a greater or less extent, the effects of a combination among landholders,
      and tends to the withholding of land from use, in expectation of higher
    prices, thus forcing the margin of cultivation farther than required by the
    necessities
      of production. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

in labour and not in capital, it must be
in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
Francisco? Go to that great city of New York, where people are
crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. Yet, why are there
not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
which to build more houses. </small></div>

growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.</span>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
    that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
    other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.<strong> For
    the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars.</strong> It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of
    vague injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an
    easy means for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches
    and communions to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are
    serving God. Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice
    to the teaching of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle
    of which the whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to
    our own is witness &#8212; the Tudor tyranny would never have arisen, and
    the separation of the church been averted; had the clergy of France never
    substituted charity for justice, the monstrous iniquities of the ancient
    r&eacute;gime would never have brought the horrors of the Great Revolution;
    and in my own country had those who should have preached justice not satisfied
    themselves with preaching kindness, chattel slavery could never have demanded
    the holocaust of our civil war.</p>
  <p>No, your Holiness; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to
    God his due while denying to their fellows the rights be gave them, so charity
    unsupported by justice can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing
    condition of labor. Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods
    to feed the poor and give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would
    continue while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting
    his wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve
      it, but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may
      do will be the danger of doing harm.</li>
    <li> Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the
      vice that is born of it breeds.</li>
    <li> Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
      of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for
      mere laborers, for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
    <li> Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are
      too many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
    <li> Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but
      drives further the class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodations
      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</li>
    <li> Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
      on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
    <li> Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
      are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
      reducing their wages.</li>
    <li> Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
      it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
      or partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he
      will do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
    <li> Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic
      times who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try
      to beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
      narrow and crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let
      him open tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful
      and attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not
      be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will
      it not be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of
      his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to landowners?
      Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things will
      start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
  <p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of
    God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad will have taken the place
  of the stagecoach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all
  the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power

He will tell you, "No!" <br>
<br>
"Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a man who
has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?" <br>
        <br>
He will tell you, "No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher; on the

for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are that it will
be harder." <br>

  <p>THE mode of taxation is quite as important as the amount. As a small burden
    badly placed may distress a horse that could carry with ease a much larger
    one properly adjusted, so a people may be impoverished and their power of
    producing wealth destroyed by taxation, which, if levied in another way,

  <p>IF we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must finally pay
    it, for the erection of buildings will cease until building rents become
    high enough to pay the regular profit and the tax besides. If we impose a
    tax upon manufactures or imported goods, the manufacturer or importer will
    charge it in a higher price to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer, and
    the retailer to the consumer. Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately
    falls, must not only pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this
    amount to everyone who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital
    he has advanced in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit
    on the capital he has advanced in paying for goods. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  THE way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
  supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon rent cannot
  check supply. Therefore though a tax on rent compels the landowners to pay
  more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use of their land, as it
  in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling
  those who hold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a
  tax on land values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus
  to reduce the price of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot study Henry George without learning how intimately each of these
      wrongs and evils is bound up with our land system. One of our great national
      weaknesses is speculation. Everybody recognizes that fact in the stock market
      orgy of our late boom days. Only a few realize the extent to which speculation
      in land is the source of many troubles of the farmer, the part it has played
      in loading banks and insurance companies with frozen assets and compelling
      the closing of thousands of banks, nor how the high rents, the unpayable mortgages
      and the slums of the cities are connected with speculation in land values.
      All authorities on public works hold that the most fruitful field for them
      is slum clearance and better housing. Yet only a few seem to realize that with
      our present situation this improvement will put a bonus in the pockets of landlords,
      and the land speculator will be the one to profit financially--for after all,
      buildings are built on land.</p>
  <p>So with taxation. There are all sorts of tinkering going on, but the tinkers
      and patchers shut their eyes to the fact that the socially produced annual
      value of land -- not of improvements, but of ground-rent value -- is about
      five billion dollars, and that its appropriation by those who create it, the
      community, would at once relieve the tax burden and ultimately would solve
      the tax problem. Of late the federal government has concerned itself with the
      problems of home ownership, but again by methods of tinkering that may easily
      in the long run do more harm than good. The community's acquisition of its
      own creation, ground-rent value, would both reduce the price of land and entirely
      eliminate taxes on improvement, thus making ownership easier. And how anyone
      expects to solve the unemployment question by putting the sanction of both
      legality and high pecuniary reward upon the ability of the few to keep the
      many from equal access to land and to the raw material, without which labor
      is impossible, I do not see -- and no one else does. For the tinkerers assume
      that unemployment must continues, only with government assistance to those
      who are necessarily out of work. By all means let us help those that now need
      it, but for the future let us prevent the cause instead of merely mitigating
      the effects. ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

        Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
          because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
        visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
        well taken
          care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
        farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
        now worth,
          at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
          office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
          by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
        health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
      <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
          this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
          And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
          he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
          thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
        of twenty million dollars?</p>
      <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
        entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
          the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
          desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
          owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
          purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
        and must have use of the land.</p>
      <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
          because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
          seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
          to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
          to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
          sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
        But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
      <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
        consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
        slums and luxury
          in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
        so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
        longer
          own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
        independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
        their mortgages.
          So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
          wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
          slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
          which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>

  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism

        of the absurdity of such an ownership. The idea of owning air was ridiculous;
        the idea of owning land was not. Yet who can explain the difference,
        except as a matter of custom?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">To the same effect was the question of the Rev. F. L.
        Higgins to a friend. While stationed at Galveston, Tex., Mr. Higgins
        fell into a discussion with his friend as to the right of government
        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Suppose,&quot; said Mr. Higgins, &quot;that the
        government should vest in a corporation title to the Gulf of Mexico,
        so that no one could fish there, or sail there, or do anything in or
        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.
        Would that be right?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, suppose the corporation should then parcel
        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Could private titles to the Gulf possibly become
        absolute in morals?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then tell me,&quot; asked Mr. Higgins, &quot;what
        difference it would make if all the water were taken off the Gulf and
        only the bare land left.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single
    Tax. 110</p>

    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. <strong>The possibility of this danger would
    be still further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer
    greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation.</strong> And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. </p>
  <p><em>Q22. What difference would it make to tenants whether they paid land
      rent to the community or to private owners?</em><br>
A. When they pay it to the community they are paying it in part to themselves,
and what others pay they share in; for they are part of the community. They are
also exempt from taxes. And since there would be no inducement to speculate in
land if rent went to the community, land would be more plentiful and rents would
consequently be lower.</p>
  <p><em>Q43. Is there any land question in places where land is cheap? In Texas,
      for example, you can get land as cheap as two dollars an acre. Is there
      a land question there?</em><br>
A. There is no place where land is cheap in the sense implied by the question.
Land commands a low price in many places, but it is poor land; it is not cheap
land. It is true that in Texas there is land that can be had for two dollars
an acre, but it would yield less profit to each unit of labor and capital expended
upon it than land in New York City which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars
an acre. The valuable New York land is the cheaper of the two. The land question
is the question in every place where land costs more than it is worth for immediate
use.</p>
  <p><em>Q44. Though some people have made money by owning land, isn't it true that
    others have lost? And don't the losses more than off-set the gains?</em><br>
    A. Possibly. But that has no bearing upon the question. What men lose through
    investments in land, the community does not gain; but what they gain the
    community does lose. Therefore, as between land speculators and the community,
    the losses cannot be charged against the gains.</p>
  <p><em>Q45. What is the difference between speculation in land and in other kinds
    of property?</em><br>
    A. If all the products of the world were cornered by speculators, but land
    were free, new products would soon appear and the ill effects of the speculation
    would quickly pass away. But if all the land were cornered by speculators,
    though everything else were free, the people would immediately be dependent
    upon the speculators for a chance to live. That illustrates the difference.</p>
  <p><em>Q46. How can it be possible that speculative land values cause business
      depressions when, as any business man will tell you, the whole item of
      land value &#8212; whether ground rent or interest on purchase money &#8212; is
      one of the smallest items in every business?</em><br>
A. You overlook the fact that the item of speculative rent is the only item which
the business man does not get back again. The cost of his goods, the expense
of clerk hire, the rent of his building, the wear and tear of implements, are
all received back, in the course of normal business, in the prices of his goods.
Even his ground rent, to the extent that it is normal (i.e., what it would be
if the supply of land were determined alone by land in use, and not affected
by the land that is held out of use for higher values), comes back to him in
the sense that his aggregate profits are that much greater than they would be
where ground rent was less. But the extra ground rent which he is obliged to
pay, in consequence of the abnormal scarcity of land, is a dead weight; it does
not come back to him. Therefore, even if infinitesimal in amount, as compared
with the other expenses of his business &#8212; and that is by no means admitted &#8212; it
is the one expense which may break a thriving business down. Besides, it is not
alone the ground rent paid by the business man for his location that bears down
upon his business prosperity; the weight of abnormally high land values in general
presses upon business in general, and by obstructing the flow of trade forces
the weaker business units to the wall. It is not altogether safe to deduce general
economic principles from the ledgers of particular business houses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice.</p>
  <p>  How did so evident a wrong become so firmly established? ...</p>
  <p>But &#8212; and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
      of taxation &#8212; Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return
      from his land, must improve it. Unless he is satisfied with a small income
      from
      it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the community chooses
      to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best building the
      location will warrant. The rents of this building will be his in their
      entirety, not
      one dollar of them being taken from him by taxation. If he is not prepared
      or not willing to do this he would probably find it more profitable, before
      he leaves the country, to sell the land to some one of the many persons
      who are eager to build upon it. It will always be salable, although not
      by any
      means at present figures.</p>
  <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
      the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
      policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium is placed
      upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy penalty
      is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
      depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
      with the land.</p>
  <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put up
      a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin which
      now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and while paying
      a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby enabled
      to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
      is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
      amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
      and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
      letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
      till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it?</p>
  <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
      making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it from
      the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.</p>
  <p>Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better
      and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores, more employment
      for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
      an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a public
      revenue adequate to all real public needs. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read

<br>
<small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b>
</small><br>
<small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done. <big>...</big></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>YOU MAY THINK the largest category of assets in this countrly is industrial
    plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve Board's annual balance sheet
    shows real estate to be the economy's largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds
    of America's wealth and more than 60 percent of that in land, depending on
    the assessment method.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most capital gains are land-value gains.
      The big players do not want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary
      income, but in capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit
      as much as possible from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land
      values they pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt
      for as much property as they can buy with as little of their own money
      as possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
      and get to keep the "capital gain".<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">This price appreciation is actually
          a "land gain," that is, it's not from providing start-up capital for
          new enterprises, but from sitting on a rising asset already in place,
          the land. </span>Its value rises because neighbourhoods are upgraded,
          mortgage money is ample, and rezoning is favorable from farmland on
          the outskirts of cities to gentrification of the core to create high-income
          residential developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's
          why developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of
          their rent income, often all of it. </p>
  <p><small><b>SUMMARY</b></small>
    </p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b>&nbsp;

George 100 Years Later: The Great Reconciler</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the
world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for
labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">These
twin plagues arose from concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation.</span> Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant
exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)</i></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George followed his analysis
with a plausible, practicable
remedy: eliminate all taxes except for a tax on land values.</b> The
"single tax," as it later became known, would invigorate the economy
by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available to those
who would use it. And it would suck the air out of speculative
bubbles, damping the boom and bust cycle.&nbsp; <span

efficiency</b>
</small><br>
<small>George refutes the commonplace idea that we must choose between
equity and efficiency. This idea is premised on identifying "equity"
with price and rent controls designed to help the poor against the
rich; or with counter-incentive progressive income taxation, with its
warping, suppressive effects. George rejects both price controls and
progressive income taxation, and identifies a different tax policy
that brings us both equity and efficiency together.<span

production supplies more goods and services. Those give substance to
the money incomes, precluding inflation such as poisoned the springs of

Capacity of Land </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.&nbsp; </b>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
      One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to use it.
      Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability to
      control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from the
      increase in its price. With most of the geo-rent tapped for public revenue,
      the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the economy, since
      with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land would instead go
      to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide better training.</p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If a
      landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to pass
      on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would be invisible
      to renters, the link between using public services and paying for them would
      be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent, so that link
      is there. If government revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not generate
      rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce land
      value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue would come from the
      landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no different than the situation
      today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no property tax, and typically
      they get government assistance. This is an argument not against the use of
      rent, but in favor of privatizing government programs. In the private sector,
      the link between ownership and control is stronger. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent a
potentially important source of public
revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small><br>
<small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. </span>The community added to the market value to land by
making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that we face is that
cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to
enact good government principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue. ... <a

          <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
          <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
          a case
          for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
          logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
          follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
          principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
          the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
          one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
          is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
          important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
          efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
          because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
          for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
          on land
          would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
          report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
          shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
          in the Appendix.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
          taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
          reasons
          why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
          world peace.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
          argument for
          taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
          offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
          rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
          price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
          land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
          increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
          become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
          land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
          on
          land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
          the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
          erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
          because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
          collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <small>.</small><br>
          <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
          that the
          return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
          rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
          what land
          is.</small><br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The quantity of land
          that is employed in any year reflects the response
          of land speculation to taxes on land.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

      and suppose that land comes in "sites." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">At each moment in time, each
      site is in one of three states:</span>
      </small>
      </p>
      <blockquote><small>1. Suitable for agriculture. </small><br>
          <small>2. Suitable for housing.</small><br>
        <small> </small><small>3. Suitable for commercial activity.</small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While each site can be used for
any activity, the net return will
be greatest if it is used for the activity for which it is suited,
provided that it remains in that activity long enough to fully
amortize the associated capital that is state-specific, durable and
immobile. </span>What could keep a site from remaining in an activity
long
enough to amortize the associated capital is that from time to time a
site makes a transition from state 1 to state 2 or from state 2 to
state 3. These transitions are imperfectly predictable. When a
transition from state 2 to state 3 occurs unexpectedly, the course of
action that maximizes the net return to the site may entail scrapping
prematurely the residential structure built there and building a
commercial structure. In such an instance, one may be able to look
backward and say that it would have been better not to have built the
residential structure at all, but rather to have left the site in
agricultural use until the transition to state 3 occurred. However,
such reckoning can affect investment decisions only to the extent
that transitions can be foreseen....</small><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition to the land management
motive for seeking to foresee
transitions, there is a speculative motive, which differs in form and
magnitude. While the land management motive is concerned with the
possibility that capital will be wasted on a site that is soon to
undergo a transition in state, the speculative motive arises from the
gains to be made from owning title to land at the time that its
better future prospects become generally known. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People differ in the costs they
incur in ascertaining whether the
signs present at a particular site herald a pending transition, and
how soon it will occur. Therefore those who have a comparative
advantage in foreseeing the transitions tend to do the speculating. A
speculator will incur the cost of ascertaining the significance of
the signs at a particular site if, based on that speculator's
experience, the probability of a transition given the signs,
multiplied by the increase in the current value of the property if
there is a transition, is greater than the sum of the cost of making
the determination, the transactions costs of acquiring the site and
the net cost of holding the site until its future prospects become
generally known. The activity of speculation yields a normal expected
private return to the funds spent on speculation, with particularly
skillful speculators also obtaining unusual returns to their unique
talents.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
speculative return from foreseeing future transitions arises
from holding title to land when pending transitions become generally
known. This return is a purely private return, with no corresponding
social return, since the land will increase in value whether or not
any given speculator holds it.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
land-management return from
foreseeing future transitions, on the other hand, arises from knowing
not to employ capital on sites where future transitions will cause
the capital to depreciate prematurely</span>. This is a social return,
since
it involves improving the allocation of scarce resources. There is no
necessary connection between the private return and the social
return. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The possibility that there could
be no social gain from an
activity that produced private speculative gains was recognized by
Paul Samuelson (1957, p. 209), in a discussion of the effects of
uncertainty on intertemporal price equilibrium <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the U.S., a further
consideration that causes development to be
postponed is the possibility of avoiding Federal income taxes on
increases in land value by including the land in one's estate. Estate
taxes are paid according to the actual value of the land (as they
would be paid on the proceeds if the land were sold), but one's heirs
pay taxes only on the increase in value after it leaves the estate,
so that taxes on the increase in value during one's lifetime can be
avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An additional social cost of land
speculation was elucidated by
Harry Gunnison Brown (1927). He pointed out that when it is possible
to profit from land speculation, land will tend to be acquired by
those who have the most extreme beliefs about how much it will rise
in value, and that such beliefs will generally be more optimistic
than is warranted. Economists have given the name <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"winner's curse"
</span>(Milgrom &amp; Weber, 1982) to the phenomenon that those who bid
the
most tend to bid too much. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The winner's
curse can cause the whole
land market to become dominated by persons with extreme beliefs about
future rises in value, creating an artificial scarcity of land for
current use, as those who have land wait for illusory future
opportunities. The winner's curse is thereby shifted to society.</span></small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of
    all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. <strong>To be sure many people have learned to position themselves
    in situations where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed
    these people come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact
    is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.
    ...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The Possibility of Land (Rent) Taxation</strong></p>
  <p>The key to understanding how taxing various forms of land conform to sound
    tax theory comes with an appreciation of the importance of economic rent.
    Largely discarded in 20th century economic analysis, rent is the price for
    the use of land. Just as the price of labor is paid in wages and the price
    of capital is paid in interest, land rent is the unearned increment that
    attaches to land in the form of a surplus when its price is not paid by its
    users. All taxes, ultimately, come out of rent; however, by collecting revenue
    from other sources, the rent is left to settle in ever increasing encrustations
    on land sites, i.e., capitalized, ultimately raising their market price.
    In so doing, these land prices are distorted so that their optimal use is
    not secured.</p>
  <p>Examples of such distortion are not difficult to identify. Consider, first
    of all, the use of locations in our urban environments, many of which are
    underused while prospective entrepreneurs are driven to second-best locations
    because titleholders opt to let the rent accrete and passively raise their
    market price. Land speculation is rife most of all in instances where there
    is a great disparity between the tax rate on these sites and the rate of
    rent appreciation. When the holding costs of ownership are nominal, there
    is no incentive for improving them or selling to others who will, and urban
    environments suffer as a result. Another example is rent that collects to
    the electromagnetic spectrum, making it attractive for owners of electronic
    media, communications networks and so on, to rely on returns to their investments
    even when the resource itself is sparsely used. So also with the time slots
    for take-offs and landings at airports. These opportunities are respected
    as private property, even while they gain in market value in response to
    the general traffic volume of the facility. This occurs regardless whether
    the particular airlines use their slots or not. London Mayor Ken Livingstone
    has proposed to tax the rent from Heathrow and Gatwick both for their revenue
    advantage and to assure their more optimal use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7]</em></strong></font> One
    could go on, pointing to any number of instances where economic rent is available
    to be had for the support of public services in lieu of conventional taxes
    which we recognize as destructive in their effects.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font> It
    is not surprising that when pressed even conventional (neoclassical) economists
    are often willing to concede that the best possible tax of all is one placed
    on land rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the

      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</strong></p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
    leaders have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e., on
    land value)
      or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their homes
      and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
    and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
      their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any
    threat to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling
      their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
      that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
    facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a
    reverse mortgage.
      But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
    benefit of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
      not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
      from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs.
      In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits
      constitutes
      a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is
      both unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater
      good. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

slashes its property tax?
Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no need

California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our fall of income per capita is
greater than appears from a
purely monetary measure. Real pay (in contrast $) has fallen more
because of the drastic rise in shelter prices. In San Francisco,
shelter takes 50 percent of the median income, with many other
cities, especially coastal ones, not far behind. It is unusual to
find livable quarters for less than $600 per month. The median home
price rose 163 percent during the 1980s to $258,000 (that is just the
median - the mean is higher). These prices are part of the C.O.L. of
all renters and new buyers, a part not fully incorporated in standard
CPI measures.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
should give one pause. It is the
expectable consequence of what
the voters did. They rejected the concept of taxing inert wealth in
favor of the alternative: taxing liquidity, cash flow, work,
production and commerce. </span>The predictable result has been to
inhibit
economic activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.
They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California had a construction
boom in the late 1980s, but it was
not healthy. It was marked by extreme scatter and instability.
Downtown L.A. was to become a great new financial capital. But it now
has nearly the highest office vacancy rate in the U.S., with of
course a high rate of builder bankruptcies. Speculative builders were
led on to over-build, in part by anticipated higher land rents and
prices. This Lorelei effect was magnified by national income-tax
provisions luring on speculative builders. But we have to ask why
California fell harder than other states, even with the
object-lessons of the oil states in clear view.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Between 1945-50, one-eighth of all

traditional economic geographers and base theorists who were at a
loss to explain the region's thriving economy. The new Angelenos
stayed and started producing everything for themselves, some things
previously imported, and others never seen before.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Eastern firms established branch

to California's great university system and stayed behind to take
jobs and make careers here, then sent their children through
California's excellent public schools. California became famous for
supporting outstanding higher education, highways, water supplies,
public health, public safety, and other public services, all without
repelling business by taxation. There was a regional "El Dorado
Effect" as demand and supply grew together. Growing local demand
allowed for economies of scale serving local markets. Food and
shelter were cheap and abundant. Land for business was accessible,
providing a basis for the California self-contained phenomenon. A
"continental tilt" developed in both interest rates and wage rates,
drawing in eastern capital and labor. <span

continuing
today?</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The invisible, pervasive change is
due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using <a href="../docs/Gwartney_Estimating_LV.html">Gwartney's
Rule of Thumb</a> (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners are only taxed now if
they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. A handful of
oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out. This helps us segue from being at the cutting edge
of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model
to the AL model - with little relief in sight. ....
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does this help you understand why
California landowners are now so
slow to adapt to new demands? In 1945 the assessors were building
fires under landowners, so they sought new strategies to meet new
circumstances. Today there remains a weak incentive to improve to
improve property: tax collectors generally cost them money when they
make improvements. Sit still, lie low, hire no one, hang on, produce
nothing, and your holding costs are negligible.... <a

the Public Subsidy of Land Speculation and Sprawl</b></small></small></small>
</small><br>
<small>... If land holders can produce a higher return on investment by
not
using land for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher
price from those willing and able to pay the higher price in the
future, there is a flaw in public policy. Public policy thereby gives
speculative, nonproductive investment a higher return than productive
investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production and
distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from
public improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
reduce sprawl.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One example that I know is that of
a friend who bought land within
the city but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money
into an investment that had no visible return? He replied that, by
holding the land for future sale or development, his long term
return, in capital gains would exceed 18% annually. If he built a
building on the site now, his long term return would only be 12%
annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should he
use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use
it, but to hold it for a larger future gain?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most major cities have a
substantial amount of fully serviced but
unused or underused land sites. It is estimated that 38% of the land
area in Los Angeles is unused, 30% in New York City and 25% in
Washington, D.C. Intercity sites are bypassed because land
speculators receive a greater benefit by ignoring the highest and
best use of land sites. A greater profit is made when development is
delayed and the land price increases to higher levels. But building
within existing developed areas uses the existing and underused
infrastructure, roads, transit, public facilities, and services.
Sprawl requires new expenditures on public goods and services, more
government, more taxes, more dislocation.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Counterproductive
growth limitations and regulations should be abolished.</b> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Property
taxes should not be levied on new construction or existing
improvements, when the revenue needed could be obtained from the land
values created and maintained by the community.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The property tax could be shifted
to reduce the incentives for
sprawl. If the property tax were taken off urban buildings and
focused on the land itself, this would penalize land speculation and
would reward people who build on their land. Thus land speculation,
which promotes a "leap frog" development out of the city and into the
surrounding countryside, would decrease. The proposed shift from
traditional property tax to a "land value tax" would penalize land
speculation and encourage urban redevelopment. Removing the tax on
buildings makes them cheaper to construct, renovate and operate, and
more affordable to buy or rent. Urban construction creates urban
jobs. Capital and labor both benefit. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">... </span><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One means that has long been
available but not brought into
general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
market for speculation a costly proposition. An annual fee on land
should be set near what the land site alone would yield if rented by
the owner to the highest bidder. Think of how this would change the
behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of land with a rental
value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged me as
my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would
either develop the land myself or put it on the market so that
someone else would develop it. At the same time, if my tax rate on
the building I constructed on the land was zero, my incentive is to
construct a building that maximizes my cash flow (i.e., to develop
the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At minimum,
land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto the
market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to
builders would tend to begin to fall over time.... <a

Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>

it
not be seen, from our greatest cities to our newest territories, in
the speculation which has everywhere been driving up the price of
land -- that is to say, the toll that the active factor in all
production must pay for permission to use the indispensable passive
factor [land]. </span>Across the street from the City Hall of Chicago,
where 1,400
men, "the great majority Americans by birth and almost all of them
voters," have been this winter sleeping in the stone corridors,
stands the Chamber of Commerce Building, thirteen stories high. This
great building cost $800,000. The lot which it covers is worth over
$1,000,000! A few blocks from where the <span

distribution began at the rate of over $12,000,000 an acre! As for
the remotest outskirts, who has not heard of the mad rush for the
Cherokee Strip? <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These recurring spasms of business
stagnation; these long-drawn
periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do
not come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to
be cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and
what is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but
speculation in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor
and capital would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail
demanded for their employment in production, and the same round would
be run again. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There is but
one remedy, and that is what is now known
as the single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and
capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and the
taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the
mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. Charity can
merely demoralize and pauperize,</span> while that indirect form of
charity,
the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses
and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by
dynamite and kerosene.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is no need for charity;
no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
speculation in land.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But, it will be said, this is not
quick enough. On the contrary,
it is quicker than anything else. Even the public recognition of its
need, by but a part of the intelligence and influence that is now
devoted to charity appeals and schemes, would have such an effect
upon the speculative price of land as to at once set labor and
capital to work.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<blockquote>
  <p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
      realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
      of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
      the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
      city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
      includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years
      ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
      declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
      1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
      New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold by
      Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
      take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
      occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build
      high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood
      of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs
      associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
      should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
      relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used for
      agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban
      areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity
      to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even
      unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly when land
      sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation service
      or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New
      York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased
      land values (constant dollars) within just two miles of its corridor in the
      forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
      is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment! The
      Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
      system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
      $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any

      development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
      to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
      course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Indeed the most widespread
notion of property ownership,
especially in realms where Roman law had left no legacy, was title in
<b>usufruct</b>, meaning title to use. But that meaning has gradually
given way to the prevailing conception of title in fee simple, even
though legal constraints have grown to curtail abuses of such
ownership and are even seen sometimes as assaults on it. Krueckeberg
notes that as many as nine kinds of property rights have been
distinguished: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>possession, </small></li>
  <li><small>use, </small></li>
  <li><small>alienation (the power to give away), </small></li>
  <li><small>consumption, </small></li>
  <li><small>modification, </small></li>
  <li><small>destruction, </small></li>
  <li><small>management, </small></li>
  <li><small>exchange, and </small></li>
  <li><small>profit taking. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">From
the first application of the land law of the New England
settlers there has been a gradual extension of private control over
land titles first to simple use, then the right to benefit, and
ultimately "to the idea of gain made by selling. Land speculation,
which was to spread across the continent, radically transformed New
England's democratic town pattern."</span> Concurrent with this
spreading
application of titles in fee simple has come changes in the meaning
of the word property, a term which, although employed in the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, was amplified only
during the second half of the 19th century. The notion of land as a
commodity has had pernicious effects on the course of our whole
civilization.&nbsp; </small><small>... <a

Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In our economy, land is a ready
object of speculation, and its
value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
the new boom will have started.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1933, the University of Chicago
published a book by <a href="Hoyt.html">Homer Hoyt</a> entitled <b><i>One Hundred
Years of Land Values in Chicago</i></b>.
This monumental study consists in 7 chapters, of which each of the
first five describes one of the five major business cycles of the
period in great detail.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was so outstanding about
Hoyt's book was its compelling
confirmation of George's analysis, some thirty-five years after
George's death in 1897! What is even more significant is Hoyt's
handling of his data in chapters six and seven, the balance of the
study. In these two chapters, he selects some sixteen events which
not only are present in each cycle, but which occur in the same order
in each cycle.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr. Hoyt concluded with the usual
caveat: that the mere fact that
this sequence is observed this many times does not guarantee that it
will ever happen again; which is to say that we can never prove
truth, we can only fail to disprove it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/monroe-john-1962.jpg">graphic
rendition</a> of one such cycle appearing on the following page was
devised by John Monroe, the Director of the Commerce and Industry
Division of the Chicago Henry George School of Social Science. For
classroom use, Mr. Monroe had set up a large magnetized blackboard
with a large inverted "U"; the sixteen items of the figure were
described on sixteen magnetized chips, which were shuffled and
distributed along the participants. The author once had a
class of five company presidents; after defining the task, he never
spoke during the exercise. The individual members had sole control as
to the place on the curve where each chip belonged. It was thrilling
to see and hear the discussion and the ultimate positioning of the
individual chips. At completion, they matched precisely the
historically-based results of Hoyt. Five converts, one of whom had
been the President both of Chicago's Real Estate Board and of its
Building Managers Association, as well as a trustee of the University
of Chicago, walked out of that session.</small></div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The wringing out of land
speculation from the dynamics of
economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which has so
labored the economic profession and the public at large. As Henry
George discovered and as Homer Hoyt so brilliantly depicted
speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle, so will
its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It will put
the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the terrible
risks to which that market has always been subject in the past.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason for such speculation
under the present practices is
obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or decreases
depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any commodity
begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and production is
thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward. Land, on the
other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can increase or
decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that operates
in the field of production does not apply to land values and
prices.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just think of the social benefits
that would accrue to a society
that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential hazards to which
all prior societies have been so subject. Production will then occur
on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the well-being of
society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions are made,
and all these will be benefits to the community as a whole, and not
just to the land-owners as in the past.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">read

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, George
differentiated sharply between land itself and
the products -- or wealth, as he termed them -- which labor made from
the land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural
forces, but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter,
and, to produce wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter
and to these forces -- that is to say, to land. The land is the
source of all wealth. It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore
that labor fashions. It is the substance to which labor gives the
form."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> George saw, as between land and
products, certain elementary
differences. "In every essential, land differs from those things
which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the
creation of God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity;
they may be increased illimitably. It exists, though generations come
and go; they in a little while decay and pass again into the
elements." </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having noted these differences,
George proceeded to use them as
the basis for his examination of related areas of economics, such as
speculation. When asked how speculation worked, George responded that
a distinction must be made between speculation in land and
speculation in products. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Writing of industrial depressions,
he said, "When, with the desire
to consume more, there coexist the ability and willingness to produce
more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot be charged either to
overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly, the trouble is that
production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy each other . </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"How does this inability arise? It
is evidently and by common
consent the result of speculation. But of speculation in what? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Certainly not of speculation in
things which are the products of
labor ...for the effect of speculation in such things, as is well
shown in current treatises that spare me the necessity of
illustration, is simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady
the interplay of production and consumption by an action analogous to
that of a fly-wheel in a machine."&nbsp; In other
words, the tendency of speculation in products is to increase the
demand for products and therefore to increase the price of products.
This increased price will induce more production, which, increasing
the supply, will tend to lower the price. Throughout this cycle,
there has been a stimulating effect on production in general. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He continued, "Therefore, if
speculation be the cause of these
industrial depressions, it must be speculation in things not the
production of labor, but yet necessary to the exertion of labor in
the production of wealth -- of things of fixed quantity; that is to
say, it must be speculation in land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How can this be? How can
speculation in land cause industrial
depression? George explains, "...that there is a connection between
the rapid construction of railroads and industrial depression, anyone
who understands what increased land values mean, and who has noticed
the effect which the construction of railroads has upon land
speculation, can easily see. Wherever a railroad was built or
projected, lands sprang up in value under the influence of
speculation, and thousands of millions of dollars were added to the
nominal values which capital and labor were asked to pay outright, or
to pay in installments, as the price of being allowed to go to work
and produce wealth. The inevitable result was to check production.
.."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tendency of speculation in
land is similar to that of
speculation in products; it increases the demand for land and thereby
increases the price of land. However, here the similarity ends. The
supply of land is fixed; as successive units of land become priced
beyond the level at which labor and capital can profitably engage in
production, an increasing (though artificial) scarcity of land
develops. "The inevitable result was to check production."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, according to George, another
difference between land and
products is that speculation in products tends to stimulate
production, whereas speculation in land tends to check production.</small><small>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One way of denying the basic

&#8220;unbalanced growth,&#8221; as in Orange County, where people

there be too many jobs? It is too little housing that is the problem,

traffic bottleneck, to central Riverside County, where it meets
demand fleeing north from San Diego. </small></p>

<p>Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values are hypersensitive to discount rates</span></small><br>
<small>The sensitivity of present values to discount rates increases as
the value being discounted.&nbsp; Land values are discounted from more
remote future values than are values of most capital, even most durable
and "fixed" capital.&nbsp; Consider land yielding an expected constant
cash flow: let the interest rate double and the present value is
halved.&nbsp; Compare the present value of a steer to be slaughtered in
one year: let the interest rate double from 5% to 10% and the present
value drops from .95 of slaughter value to .91. Even that overstates it
a lot because we haven't accounted for the feed bill, but never mind,
the point should be clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Let buyers expect land's cash flow to rise annually by a growth
coefficient, G, and the valuation formula is cash flow divided by the
interest rate minus the growth rate (I-G), rather than I alone.&nbsp;
Now let the interest rate double, and the present value is cut to less
than half.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Or let land be yielding a nominal current cash flow and to be
held in anticipation of a higher use to begin 10 years down the road,
and thirty years after that to be renewed for an even higher use.&nbsp;
Let there be a whiff of oil, or the floating value of a shopping
center, or the possible extension of a freeway and a new water supply
paid by others.&nbsp; Let there be a fear (or hope) that Washington
will debauch the currency sometime again in this century, or that
another Howard Jarvis will cut land taxes some more, or that future
building costs will fall: any and all of these, which are common and
familiar expectations, make present values of land more sensitive to
discount rates than in the simple basic capitalization model which is
based on assumed constant cash flow in perpetuity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Expectations like those denoted above by G, or like the
anticipated higher future use referred to, are "a state of the public
mind" (Richard Hurd, Principles of City Land Values).&nbsp; They are
incapable of proof or disproof in the present and, whether proven true
or false in the future, will have lost relevance, to be replaced by new
expectations of new futures that unfold endlessly as time passes.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now consider the market for land
titles.&nbsp; This is the more relevant market as to building,
transferring land between uses, and changing parcel sizes.&nbsp; If the
market for land services is slow, the market for land titles is
viscous.&nbsp; There is no flow of supply, none at all.&nbsp; There is
no real turnover in the sense of producing and using up.&nbsp; There is
only ownership turnover: the market only transfers existing
titles.&nbsp; (There is a supplemental market in long leases, not
addressed here.)<br>
<br>
There are few highly motivated sellers, as there are motivated sellers
of spoiling produce and obsolescing computers and vehicles.&nbsp;
Median home-owners are motivated, when transferred to another
region.&nbsp; Few other land sellers come close to that degree of
motivation (and the median home represents more capital than
land).&nbsp; Capital depreciates; goods spoil and obsolesce; idle labor
starves; but land silently rises in value.<br>
<br>
The aggregate of all land changes hands slowly, with one or two percent
turnover of ownership annually (measuring the stock by value, not
number of parcels - smaller, cheaper parcels turn faster).&nbsp; But
buyers often need adjacent land, or land in particular districts or
with particular qualities, and find little or no land on the market, or
land controlled by one seller.<br>
<br>
The slow ownership turnover cited above applies to total real estate,
i.e. land including any buildings on it.&nbsp; Ownership turnover is
even slower for bare land.&nbsp; If the average building lasts 50
years, only 2% of the land is available for re-use in any given
year.&nbsp; Only a fraction of that 2% is for sale; the rest is renewed
by the same owner.&nbsp; Whoever wants to buy available land in any
particular area is unlikely to be faced with the "many sellers"
premised by the competitive model.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Hoarding for vertical integration.</span><br>
A common precaution against sticky markets is buying excess land for
possible future expansion.&nbsp; This behavior makes markets that much
more sticky.&nbsp; It is one of those things that necessitates and
justifies itself, considered in the aggregate: it is self-aggravating
and self-authenticating.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">When
anyone buys and holds for his own future expansion, everyone has
to:&nbsp; it is a positive feedback loop of possessiveness run wild.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The composite result of individuals'
buying for future contingent need is that the market in raw land is
turned to glue.&nbsp; It ceases to serve the median person in time of
need.</span>&nbsp; The effect is a species of vertical integration and,
like all vertical integration, it destroys the free market in raw
materials and vastly inflates the aggregate need for holding raw
materials.&nbsp; This is because the<span style="font-weight: bold;">
pooling effect</span> such as the market provides inherently.&nbsp;
That is, the grocer obtains, stores and keeps a wide variety of food
and sundries on tap for thousands of customers.&nbsp; Lacking a grocer,
each customer would have to maintain her own stores, and the aggregate
required would far exceed that in the common grocery store.&nbsp; A
good land market would likewise keep land on tap for the contingent
needs of all, greatly lowering aggregate needs.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assembly</span>.&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>In certain ecotones (zones of change of land use) the technical
need is to assemble small parcels into larger ones, as where commerce,
industry and high rise are moving into a district of single homes on
small lots.&nbsp; This condition maximizes market failure.&nbsp; It
normally takes years to assemble an optimal parcel: one holdout can
spoil years of negotiating and financing.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Straw buyers and front men are used to keep principals and their
intentions secret.&nbsp; Speculators are everywhere, trying to assemble
large plots or hold up other buyers.&nbsp; Whole districts are held by
anonymous absentees; buildings deteriorate, neighborhoods lose their
natural leaders and stabilizers, and communities disintegrate leaving
slums and blight, crime and arson, public charges and vandalism.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The sum of those factors makes for an inefficient market in land
titles.&nbsp; Everyone who can tries to acquire land for his own future
expansion.&nbsp; Timely subdivision may be foregone in anticipation of
future assembly problems, skipping an entire generation of optimal land
use.&nbsp; Neighbors adjusting lot lines have only each other to deal
with. Aggregate landownership is highly concentrated because of the
small numbers who can invest for deferred yields; the number of sellers
in one district or for one use is more narrowly limited because of
spatial immobility and low turnover and impossibility of new land
creation.&nbsp; Financing is especially difficult because the asset is
not self-liquidating.&nbsp; Many holders are waiting for the rise, and/
or for greater certainty to be provided by the advance commitments of
others who are in turn waiting for them.&nbsp; Net result: wasted,
underutilized land.... <a

    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which every
    human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was fixed in supply,
    the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to enjoy exclusive
    rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer majority from
    land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners in order to access
    this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of rents by landowners
    allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing to the productive
    efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did the demand for land,
    forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition, increases in land
    value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such as roads and public
    transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the expense of the community.
    Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged speculation in land, pushing
    prices even higher, while exposing the economy to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;.
    ...</p>
  <p>The demand for land involves both use values and exchange values. People
    seek land because the housing built on it provides shelter and security,
    but they also purchase it as a store of wealth and a means of capital appreciation.
    A particularly important driver of real estate prices has been the speculative
    demand, as investors seek capital gains in the property market. In Australia,
    this has been such common and longstanding practice that it has been referred
    to as &#8216;the national hobby&#8217; (Sandercock, 1979). By &#8216;creaming
    off&#8217; a part of this potential capital gain, a higher uniform rate of
    land tax would act as a disincentive to this property speculation, and could
    therefore be expected to exert a downward influence on property prices. Georgists
    have always been emphatic that land taxes are different from other taxes
    in this respect &#8211; they depress prices because they reduce demand. So
    the usual fears that a tax will be &#8216;passed on&#8217; to customers (such
    as housing tenants, in this case) do not apply.4 By making land less attractive
    as an item to be purchased in the hope of making capital gains, land tax
    can therefore be an important check on the inflationary process. ...<br>
    Concerns about urban policies also raise questions about the current relevance
    of Georgist ideas. For example, it is pertinent to ask whether a more uniform
    land tax would encourage the more efficient utilisation of urban space. George
    argued that, in order to cover the costs of a higher rate of land tax, landowners
    would be forced to put their land to its most productive use, and could not
    afford to hold it idle. Here is a clear link with the modern concerns to
    discourage &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and to promote &#8216;urban consolidation.&#8217; To
    the extent that a higher land tax would encourage the development of more
    housing in existing urban areas, the pressures for housing development in
    outlying areas would be significantly reduced. This, in turn, could reduce
    the burgeoning demand for transport that is currently characteristic of large
    cities.</p>
  <p>Land tax also impacts on the politics of peripheral urban expansion. Currently,
    the prospect of huge capital gains resulting from decisions by local governments
    to rezone land from rural to urban acts as an incentive for landowners on
    the fringes of built-up areas to lobby for changes that will allow increased
    development. Hence, landowners push for rights to subdivision, irrespective
    of whether or not there is actual demand (Day, 1995: 3). By creaming off
    the gains from windfall increases in land values, land tax obviates this
    bias towards relentless urban expansion.</p>
  <p>However, the question remains: would a uniform land tax be sufficient to
    produce more efficient patterns of urban development? Or would there still
    be a need for direct land use controls? Land tax can certainly be a tool
    for discouraging the wasteful use of land. It tends to discourage people
    from purchasing excessive amounts of land or leaving it idle. However, it
    may also encourage the overdevelopment of land in order to produce the income
    stream necessary to pay the higher rate of tax.</p>
  <p>Critics of urban consolidation such as Patrick Troy (1996) have examined
    the potential problems of such overdevelopment, including a range of environmental
    impacts such as altered hydrological processes. It seems to be an overly
    bold claim that a Georgist land tax alone would be sufficient to achieve
    optimal urban development patterns. Land use controls a necessary adjunct
    to land tax - in setting minimum requirements for green space, for example.</p>
  <p>Local government planning controls are also important to prevent incompatibility
    of land uses, such the development of hazardous or unhealthy industrial activities
    adjacent to residential areas. Targeted decentralisation policies are a means
    of encouraging the further development of regional centres. Such policies
    can work in conjunction with land taxes to ease growth pressures in the larger
    cities, while addressing long-standing spatial, social and economic inequalities
    (Stilwell, 2000: 254-260). The desirability of promoting more decentralised
    regional development is consistent with a Georgist perspective, but not altogether
    compatible with the claim that land tax would facilitate urban consolidation.
    It seems clear that it &#8216;overburdens&#8217; land tax to expect it alone
    to produce the best spatial outcomes, taking account of all the economic,
    social and environmental issues involved in urban and regional policy. The
    various other policy instruments &#8211; including regulations relating to
    green space, zoning, and the provision of public infrastructure to pave the
    way for decentralisation &#8211; are important complements to land taxation.
    In other words, land tax is best regarded as a necessary but not sufficient
    condition for more effective spatial policy. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Why did this happen? <strong>There are many explanations. One is that
        welfare kept the poor poor; this was argued by Charles Murray in his
        1984 book <em>Losing Ground</em>. Welfare, he contended, encouraged single
        mothers to remain unmarried, increased the incidence of out-of-wedlock
        births, and created a parasitic underclass. In other words, Murray (and
        others) blamed victims or particular policies for perpetuating poverty,
        but paid scant attention to why poverty exists in the first place.</strong></p>
    <p>There are, of course, many roots, but my own hypothesis is this: much
      of what we label private wealth is taken from, or coproduced with, the
      commons. However, these takings from the commons are far from equal. <strong>To
      put it bluntly, the rich are rich because (through corporations) they get
      the lion&#8217;s share of common wealth; the poor are poor because they
      get very little.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Another way to say this is that, just as water flows downhill
        to the sea, so money flows uphill to property.</strong> Capitalism by
        its very design maximizes returns to existing wealth owners. <strong>It
        benefits, in particular, those who own stock when a successful company
        is young;
        they can receive hundreds, even thousands of times their initial investments
        when the company matures. Moreover, once such stockholders accumulate
        wealth, they can increase it through reinvestment, pass it on to their
        heirs, and use their inevitable influence over politicians to gain extra
        advantages &#8212; witness the steady lowering of taxes on capital gains,
        dividends, and inheritances.</strong> On top of this, in the last few decades,
        has been the phenomenon called globalization. The whole point of globalization
        is to increase the return to capital by enabling its owners to find the
        lowest costs on the planet. Hence the stagnation at the bottom alongside
        the surging wealth at the top. </p>
    <p>A critical piece of this analysis is that <strong>very few new shares
        of corporate stock are issued.</strong> As author Marjorie Kelly has pointed out, most established
      corporations finance growth through retained earnings and debt. They&#8217;re
      just as likely to buy back outstanding shares as to issue new ones. Consequently,
      old wealth is rarely diluted. <strong>When new money flows into the stock market,
      its main effect is to increase the wealth of existing stockholders and
      their fortunate heirs. Thus, of the total gain in marketable wealth that
      occurred in the United States between 1983 and 1998, more than half went
      to the top 1 percent.</strong></p>
    <p>The companies that do issue new stock are the young ones &#8212; the Microsofts,
      Apples, and Googles. Entertainers and athletes aside, most new multimillionaires
      are early stockholders in corporations like these. In these cases, however,
      the distribution of gains is so tilted in favor of these early stockholders
      that the skewed pattern of wealth distribution is replicated. New wealth
      joins old wealth, but the concentration remains the same. There&#8217;s
      no mechanism for dispensing wealth &#8212; even new wealth &#8212; more
      evenhandedly. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
