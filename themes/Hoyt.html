Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<blockquote>
  <p>In our economy, land is a ready object of speculation, and its
    value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
    market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
    prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
    increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
    present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
    current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
    today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
    The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
    imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
    rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
    threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
    passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
    The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
    back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
    the new boom will have started.</p>
  <p>In 1933, the University of Chicago published a book by <a href="Hoyt.html">Homer
      Hoyt</a>    entitled <b><i>One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago</i></b>.
    This monumental study consists in 7 chapters, of which each of the
    first five describes one of the five major business cycles of the
    period in great detail.</p>
  <p>What was so outstanding about Hoyt's book was its compelling
    confirmation of George's analysis, some thirty-five years after
    George's death in 1897! What is even more significant is Hoyt's
    handling of his data in chapters six and seven, the balance of the
    study. In these two chapters, he selects some sixteen events which
    not only are present in each cycle, but which occur in the same order
    in each cycle.</p>
  <p>Mr. Hoyt concluded with the usual caveat: that the mere fact that
    this sequence is observed this many times does not guarantee that it
    will ever happen again; which is to say that we can never prove
    truth, we can only fail to disprove it.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/monroe-john-1962.jpg">graphic
    rendition</a> of one such cycle appearing on the following page was
    devised by John Monroe, the Director of the Commerce and Industry
    Division of the Chicago Henry George School of Social Science. For
    classroom use, Mr. Monroe had set up a large magnetized blackboard
    with a large inverted "U"; the sixteen items of the figure were
    described on sixteen magnetized chips, which were shuffled and
    distributed along the participants. The author once had a
    class of five company presidents; after defining the task, he never
    spoke during the exercise. The individual members had sole control as
    to the place on the curve where each chip belonged. It was thrilling
    to see and hear the discussion and the ultimate positioning of the
    individual chips. At completion, they matched precisely the
    historically-based results of Hoyt. Five converts, one of whom had
    been the President both of Chicago's Real Estate Board and of its
    Building Managers Association, as well as a trustee of the University
    of Chicago, walked out of that session.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">There are banks which have gone under
    supporting rising land
    prices, loaning money on land at speculative price levels. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The answer
    is not to rescue those banks; it is to rid ourselves of the
    fundamental process of speculation in land values.</span></p>
  <p>The wringing out of land speculation from the dynamics of
    economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which has so
    labored the economic profession and the public at large. As Henry
    George discovered and as Homer Hoyt so brilliantly depicted
    speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle, so will
    its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It will put
    the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the terrible
    risks to which that market has always been subject in the past.</p>
  <p>The reason for such speculation under the present practices is
    obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or decreases
    depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any commodity
    begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and production is
    thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward. Land, on the
    other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can increase or
    decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that operates
    in the field of production does not apply to land values and
    prices.</p>
  <p>Just think of the social benefits that would accrue to a society
    that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential hazards to which
    all prior societies have been so subject. Production will then occur
    on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the well-being of
    society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions are made,
    and all these will be benefits to the community as a whole, and not
    just to the land-owners as in the past.
