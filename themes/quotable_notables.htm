<p><span style="font-style: italic;">"The land, the earth, God gave to man for

    or enterprise, acquiring land should hold no more than is required for their
    home and sustenance, and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent
    management of their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted
    when it creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be
    held for the free use of every family to make homesteads and to hold them

<p><em>The land is God's. It should not and cannot belong to anyone. All people
    have an equal right to it and the only concern is how to distribute it. ...
    Many
  people like you truthfully say that the land cannot be anyone's property. Genuine
  property is determined only by labor and people must work in harmony on it.
  Many truly understand that to distribute the land among the people is important
  and wise. These matters were resolved in a very just form by the American scholar
  Henry George. . . . &#8212; </em> <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a> (1828

<p><em>&quot;Mr. Wilson had but one prejudice. That was against wealth; he believed
    that no man could honestly amass a million dollars in a lifetime. At heart
    he was a follower of Henry George and strongly objected to private profit
    accruing through the increase in land values.&quot; </em>&#8212; Henry Morgenthau,
    Sr., of President Woodrow Wilson (1856 - 1924), in an interview with S. J.
    Woolf, in the <em>New York Times</em> of April 27, 1941.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The &#8220;single tax&#8221; is so simple, so fundamental, and so
    easy to carry into effect that I have no doubt that it will be about the
    last reform the world will ever get. People in this world are not often logical.&#8221;</em> &#8212; <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">Clarence
    Darrow</a> (1857 - 1938)</p>
<p><em>Wrong taxation, including failure to tax swollen inheritances and
    unused land and other natural resources held for speculative purposes, is
    one of these elements. ... we must insure so far as possible the
    use of certain types of great natural resources for the benefit of the people
    as a whole. The public should not alienate its fee in the water power which
    will be of incalculable consequence as a source of power in the immediate
    future. The Nation and the States within their several spheres should by
    immediate legislation keep the fee of the water power, leasing its use only
    for a reasonable length of time on terms that will secure the interests of
    the public. ... We do not intend that our natural resources shall
    be exploited by the few against the interests of the many, nor do we intend
    to turn them over to any man who will wastefully use them by destruction,
    and leave to those who come after us a heritage damaged by just so much.
    The man in whose interests we are working is the small farmer and settler,
    the man who works with his own hands, who is working not only for himself
    but for his children, and who wishes to leave to them the fruits of his labor.
    ... The Government should at once construct, own, and operate the
    railways in Alaska. The Government should keep the fee of all the coal-fields
    and allow them to be operated by lessees with the condition in the lease
    that non-use shall operate as a forfeit. Telegraph lines should
    be operated as the railways are. Moreover, it would be well in Alaska
    to try a system of land taxation which will, so far as possible, remove all
    the burdens from those who actually use the land, whether for building or
    for agricultural purposes, and will operate against any man who holds the
    land for speculation, or derives an income from it based, not on his own
    exertions, but on the increase in value due to activities not his own. There
    is very real need that this Nation shall seriously prepare itself for the
    task of remedying social injustice and meeting social problems by well-considered
    governmental effort ... </em>&#8212; <a href="underpop/RooseveltT.htm">Theodore Roosevelt</a> (1858 - 1919; president from 1901-1909)</p>

  Ford</a> (1863 - 1947)</small></p>
