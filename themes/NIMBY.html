</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>So many of the reasons that people say &quot;NIMBY&quot; -- not in <em>my</em> back
    yard! -- relate to property values. But suppose we had a system where when
    an undesirable neighbor brings down property values, the effect is that one
    pays less in land value tax for the privilege of occupying one's land.</p>
  <p>Many of us live in houses that we could not otherwise afford, because the
    houses are located on sites that others consider inferior: next to an interstate
    highway, on a severe slope, etc. The same house on a more typical site in the
    area would sell for a great deal more. The difference is the site value.</p>

Value Rating</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Site value rating embodies the
principle that people are allowed
to keep what they produce and must pay annually for the value of the
naturally occurring and socially created resources they use. This
principle can be extended to take account of individual actions that
have noticeable effects on the rental value of land surrounding that
which individuals use themselves. When land is used in such a way as
to raise the rental value of surrounding land, as by providing
parking near a commercial center or by providing improvements that
are beautiful to see, the person who creates that value should
receive it. Correspondingly, when people use land in such a way as to
lower the value of surrounding land, by generating noise, noxious
smells, air pollution, or unsightly views, they should be charged
according to the reduction in the rental value of the surrounding
land that results from their activity. The opportunity to be paid for
adding to the value of surrounding land will generally make land more
valuable. And the requirement to pay for harmful consequences of land
use will tend to inhibit such uses of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The whole practice of planning
should be replaced by a system of
charges for harmful consequences of land use and payments for
beneficial ones. Planning is motivated by a concern for the harmful
consequences that can result from land development. But the resulting
restriction in land development makes planning permission all the
more valuable to the few who receive it, with the result that vast
fortunes are made by contriving to appear to have, in one's person or
in one's projects, whatever attributes are regarded as attractive by
those who grant planning permission. With so much money at stake, it
is virtually impossible to avoid bias. A recognition of the
impropriety of the large gains from receiving planning permission
leads planning bodies to be ever more strict about granting it, and
the result is ever higher prices of homes, to the detriment of
first-time buyers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When there are harmful
consequences of land development, these are
generally manifest in lower rental values of land near the land that
is developed. The effort that is now devoted to determining whether
to grant planning permission should be spent instead on identifying
the magnitudes of the harmful consequences of development. Then
everyone who wishes to develop land, and everyone who has title to
land that is already developed, should be charged those costs. Those
who have land that is adversely affected by development would be
compensated automatically through the reduction in the rates on their
land. ... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

Value Taxation: The Overlooked But Vital Eco-Tax</a><br>

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>The LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring
human activity, onto our use and abuse of natural resources, as any
responsible form of stewardship should. The potential effect of such a
focus on everyday attitudes is inestimable.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The process of monitoring and assessing LVT itself leads to a
more
subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently,
many natural resources are almost assigned a worthless value because,
not entering the mainstream marketplace, they usually have no $ tags
hanging off them - hence the existence of externalities whereby the
environment is plundered as near worthless.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So
even wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span>
