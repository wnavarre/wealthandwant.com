<blockquote>
  <p>The sympathy of your Holiness seems exclusively directed to the poor, the
    workers. Ought this to be so? Are not the rich, the idlers, to be pitied
    also? By the word of the gospel it is the rich rather than the poor who call
    for pity, for the presumption is that they will share the fate of Dives.
    And to any one who believes in a future life the condition of him who wakes
    to find his cherished millions left behind must seem pitiful. But even in
    this life, how really pitiable are the rich. The evil is not in wealth in
    itself &#8212; in its command over material things; it is in the possession
    of wealth while others are steeped in poverty; in being raised above touch
    with the life of humanity, from its work and its struggles, its hopes and
    its fears, and above all, from the love that sweetens life, and the kindly
    sympathies and generous acts that strengthen faith in man and trust in God.</p>
  <p>Consider how the rich see the meaner side of human nature; how they are
    surrounded by flatterers and sycophants; how they find ready instruments
    not only to gratify vicious impulses, but to prompt and stimulate them; how
    they must constantly be on guard lest they be swindled; how often they must
    suspect an ulterior motive behind kindly deed or friendly word; how if they
    try to be generous they are beset by shameless beggars and scheming impostors;
    how often the family affections are chilled for them, and their deaths anticipated
    with the ill-concealed joy of expectant possession. <strong>The worst evil of poverty
    is not in the want of material things, but in the stunting and distortion
    of the higher qualities. So, though in another way, the possession of unearned
    wealth likewise stunts and distorts what is noblest in man.</strong></p>
  <p>God&#8217;s commands cannot be evaded with impunity. <strong>If it be God&#8217;s
    command that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must suffer.
    And they do. See the utter vacancy of the lives of those who live for pleasure;
    see the loathsome vices bred in a class who surrounded by poverty are sated
    with wealth. </strong>See that terrible punishment of ennui, of which the poor know
    so little that they cannot understand it; see the pessimism that grows among
    the wealthy classes &#8212; that shuts out God, that despises men, that deems
    existence in itself an evil, and fearing death yet longs for annihilation.</p>
  <p>When Christ told the rich young man who sought him to sell all he had and
    to give it to the poor, he was not thinking of the poor, but of the young
    man. And I doubt not that among the rich, and especially among the self-made
    rich, there are many who at times at least feel keenly the folly of their
    riches and fear for the dangers and temptations to which these expose their
    children. But the strength of long habit, the prompting of pride, the excitement
    of making and holding what have become for them the counters in a game of
    cards, the family expectations that have assumed the character of rights,
    and the real difficulty they find in making any good use of their wealth,
    bind them to their burden, like a weary donkey to his pack, till they stumble
    on the precipice that bounds this life. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q46. Would it not be confiscation so to increase the tax on land?</em><br>
A. What would be confiscated? No land would be taken, no right of occupancy,
  or use, or improvement, or sale, or devise; nothing would be taken that is
  conveyed or guaranteed by the title deed.</p>
  <p><em>Q47. What is the distinction between taxation and confiscation?</em><br>
  A. The sovereign state may appropriate private property of its citizens in
    two ways: (1) by confiscation; (2) by taxation. When one particular man by
    treason or otherwise has forfeited his rights as a citizen, the land and
    houses and personalty of this one man may all be &quot;forfeit to the crown,&quot; while
    the validity and sanctity of 9,999 other men's rights are in no way infringed.
    This is confiscation. On the other hand, when the state, in order to obtain
    the revenue to meet the expenses of government, levies tribute upon its 10,000
    citizens impartially, this is taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q48. But would it not be an injustice to the landowner?</em><br>
  A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes (wages) to maintain an
    unearned income (net economic rent) that bears no tax burden, how can it
    be an injustice to stop doing so? There can be no injustice in taking for
    the benefit of the community the value that is created by the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q61. Do you think there would be any injustice in taking by taxation
      the future increment in the value of land?</em><br>
A. Fifteen professors of political economy have answered &quot;Yes.&quot; Ninety-four
have answered &quot;No.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the Leader of the
Opposition seeks by comparisons to show
that the same reasoning which has been applied to land ought also in
logic and by every argument of symmetry to be applied to the unearned
increment derived from other processes which are at work in our
modern civilisation, he only shows by each example he takes how
different are the conditions which attach to the possession of land
and speculation in the value of land from those which attach to other
forms of business speculation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If," he inquires, "you tax the
unearned increment on land, why
don't you tax the unearned increment from a large block of stock? I
buy a piece of land; the value rises. I buy stocks; their value
rises." But the operations are entirely dissimilar. In the first
speculation the unearned increment derived from land arises from a
wholly sterile process, from the mere withholding of a commodity
which is needed by the community. In the second case, the investor in
a block of shares does not withhold from the community what the
community needs. The one operation is in restraint of trade and in
conflict with the general interest, and the other is part of a
natural and healthy process, by which the economic plant of the world
is nourished and from year to year successfully and notably
increased.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then the right hon. gentleman
instanced the case of a new railway
and a country district enriched by that railway. The railway, he
explained, is built to open up a new district; and the farmers and
landowners in that district are endowed with unearned increment in
consequence of the building of the railway. But if after a while
their business aptitude and industry create a large carrying trade,
then the railway, he contends, gets its unearned increment in its
turn.</small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the right
hon. gentleman cannot call the increment unearned
which the railway acquires through the regular service of carrying
goods, rendering a service on each occasion in proportion to the
tonnage of goods it carries, making a profit by an active extension
of the scale of its useful business - he cannot surely compare that
process with the process of getting rich merely by sitting still? It
is clear that the analogy is not true. ... <a

  <p>Taxes on goods are added to the price of goods and passed on to the consumer.
      There is only one kind of tax that is not a curse, and that is the land tax.
      If you tax a pair of shoes a dollar, the manufacturer will add that to the
      price of the shoes, and thus diminish the number of shoes the people can buy.

      it is to secure, and it is the only thing that increases by taxation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q18. How would you reach the bondholder, or the man with money alone?</em><br>
    A. Why should we wish to reach him if his bonds or his money represent labor
      products to which he has honestly acquired a just title? This question
      is a legitimate offspring of the plundering theory that men should be taxed
      according to their ability to pay, the merits of which are considered on
      pages 7-9. It is a question which may also have been suggested by the fact
      that &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; are so often
      men who have special privileges which coin money for them. There is a feeling
      that it would be unfair to allow such special privileges to escape taxation.
      It would be. But inquiry will show that the most important of these privileges
      rest in the ownership of land, and that the &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men
      of money&quot; whom the questioner probably has in mind, are in fact great
      landlords; that is to say, that their fortunes are really based upon land.
      <strong>When land values were taxed, the great source of unearned incomes &#8212; land
      monopoly &#8212; would be practically abolished</strong>, and bondholders
      and men of money would be only those who earn what they have. Such property
      no
      man of honest instincts should wish to expropriate. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p><em>Q21. Do not the benefits of good government increase the value of houses
      as well as of land?</em><br>
A. No. <strong>Houses are never worth any more than it costs to reproduce them.
Good government tends to diminish the cost of house building; how, then, can
good
government increase the value of houses?</strong> You are confused by the fact
that houses, being attached to land, seem to increase in value, when it is the
land and not the house that really increases. It is the same mistake that a somewhat
noted economic teacher, who advocates protection as his specialty, made when
he tried
to show that there is an &quot;unearned increment&quot; to houses as well as
to lands. He did so by instancing a lot of vacant land which had risen in value
from $5000 to $10,000, and comparing it with a house on a neighboring lot which,
as he said, had also increased in value from $5000 to $10,000. At the moment
when he wrote, the house to which he referred could have been reproduced for
$5000; and had he been capable of thinking out a proposition he must have discovered
that it was the lot on which the house stood, and not the house itself, which
had increased in value.</p>

      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend. ...</p>

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SEARCH FOR SURROGATES </span></small><br>
<small>The frustrated economist, unable to tax runoff, still has a bag
of tricks.&nbsp; He looks for surrogates to tax, something in a sack or
bottle that moves through a market: Aha! pesticides, fertilizers, salt,
they'll do nicely to tax.&nbsp; Thus we will "internalize the
externalities" and have "proper pricing of inputs" to create incentives
for correct "trade&#8209;offs" in the "production functions," and we're
nearly home.&nbsp; Well, halfway home.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Well, we've made a start.&nbsp; A few problems remain.&nbsp; One
is that a plurality of economists don't like the effluent charge
approach anyway, even for point sources.&nbsp; They follow Coase and
prefer to grant pollution entitlements to be traded in a free
market.&nbsp; Incredibly (to me) this view has prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In principle they profess not to care what worthy few get the
original entitlements, but in practise a select company of ancient and
honorable polluters get them.&nbsp; We now call these "offset rights,"
a new form of property.&nbsp; In the L.A. Basin (South Coast Air
Quality Management District), a few have grown rich by establishing
their respective histories of pollution which they can now sell to
others who wish to continue this wholesome tradition.&nbsp; The
demonstration effect on those contemplating new and as yet unregulated
forms of pollution may be imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Those needing air to breathe?&nbsp; Well, according to the
modern philosophers they can enter the market, buy up offset rights and
retire them.&nbsp; Thus is fulfilled Robert Ingersoll's forecast a
century ago that if some corporation could bottle the air they would
charge us to breathe.&nbsp; It seems to confirm this dour warning from
a former Secretary of Labor:&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>"We soon&nbsp; discovered ...&nbsp; the danger of allowing
economic policy to be dominated by business or financial interests or,
which usually comes to the same thing, orthodox economic
analysis."&nbsp; (Marshall, p.ix) (emphasis added)</small><br>
<br>
<small>The public has learned what is being done to it, finally, and is
rebelling at the Coase logic, which only a Chicago economist could
love.&nbsp; Offset rights are on the ropes.&nbsp; To simplify,
therefore, I am not going to speculate how Coase might be applied to
nonpoint, but just ignore it.&nbsp; I will treat effluent charges, and
taxes on surrogates, as the conventional economic solution to
pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But before leaving this there
is a lesson in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holders of offset rights, whether
"ancient and honorable" or "innocent purchasers," are demanding
compensation.&nbsp; Never mind about asking them to pay the victims;
they demand payment to stop!&nbsp; (Polakovic, 1987)&nbsp; </span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">They will probably get it, for
if the system be changed, there will be a taking of something, which
they claim is property.&nbsp; Such is the force of the Great Secular
Superstition, that unearned gains are sacred, even those originating
with something as unworthy as dumping crud on other human beings.&nbsp;
This superstition is why effective control seems so expensive.&nbsp;</span>

Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

establish the taxability of capital gains, to show how to tax
unrealized gains as they accrue. It&#8217;s surprisingly easy: levy a
property tax based on the market value of appreciating land. That is
just what the property tax was, before the current movement to limit

      luck, but the money was as good as though I had earned it honestly:
      better, in fact, because 60% of the gain was not even reportable as
      taxable income. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but buyers

Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
industrialization and urbanization in the
second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The apostle of land taxation is Henry George. In his famous book
<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a> he develops
his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land. <br>
<br>
For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by taxing
land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have increased
tremendously during recent years. For instance <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in Los Angeles county the assessed value of
land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002 millions in 1962,
an increase of a little over 100%.</span> The assessed values, are
supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus the unearned increment in
land values during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions. </span>Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. While land values have risen by
about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land averaged about 1.5%.
Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land would have earned
about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from its proper use. </small><small><small><big><big><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We used to be confronted
constantly by the question: "Well,
after you have divided the land up, how do you propose to keep it
divided?" We don't meet that question now. The Single Tax has,
at least, this great merit: it suggests our method; it shows the way
we would travel &#8212; the simple way of abolishing all taxes, save one
tax upon land values. Now, mark: One tax upon land values. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We do not propose a tax upon land,
as people who misapprehend us
constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; we propose a tax
upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. A tax
that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
increment; that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes to
the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, the distinction between a
tax on land and a tax on land
values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
community. But a tax on land values cannot fall on all land, because
all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
valuable land in proportion to its value; therefore, it can no more
become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
privileges of any kind. It can merely take from the individual, not
the earnings of the individual, but <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">that premium which, as society
grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior
quality.&nbsp; </span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...If the railway makes greater
profits, it is usually because it carries more goods and more
passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a better practice, it is
because the doctor attends more patients and more exacting patients,
and because the lawyer pleads more suits in the courts and more
important suits. At every stage the doctor or the lawyer is giving
service in return for his fees, and if the service is too poor or the
fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can come freely into
competition. There is constant service, there is constant competition;
there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the public interest, there
is no impediment to the general progress.</small></div>

comparing these healthy processes with the enrichment which comes to
the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or at
the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy population
around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient, more famous
every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. Roads are
made, streets are made, railway services are improved, electric light
turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is
brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all
the while the landlord sits still.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To not one of those improvements does the
land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced. </span>He renders
no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called 'ripening' -- ripening at the
expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for the unearned
increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be diverted to avoid
this forbidden area. The merchant going to his office, the artisan
going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a tram fare to avoid
it. The citizens are losing their chance of developing the land, the
city is losing its rates, the State is losing its taxes which would
have accrued if the natural development had taken place; and that share
has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and
taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of
the world -- the hard and growing competition of the world -- both in
time and money. And all the while the land monopolist has only to sit
still and watch complacently his property multiplying in value,
sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on his part;
and that is justice!
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small> Every one of those improvements
  is effected by the labour and at the cost of other people. Many of the
  most important are effected at the cost of the municipality and of the
  ratepayers. </small></p>
  <p><small>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned increment
      reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
      follow the process a little further. The population of the
      city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
      poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
      thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
      120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
      present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale -- that means that
      the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
      not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
      twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
      alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
      the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
      sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
      been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
      strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
      when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact, you may say that the
      unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
      by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
      meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
      increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
  not to the service but to the disservice done. <strong>...</strong>  </small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let the Manchester Ship
Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling -- or an average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small>Now what had the landowner done for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for
making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy
bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in value.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The shareholders and the
ratepayers </span></small><small>I have told you what happened to the
landowners. Let us see what
happened to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">shareholders </span>and
the ratepayers who found the money. The ordinary shareholders, who
subscribed eight millions, have had no dividend yet. The Corporation
loan of five millions interest on which is borne on the rates each
year, had, until 1907, no return upon its capital. A return has come at
last, and no doubt the future prospects are good; but there was a long
interval -- even for the corporation. These are the men who did the
work. These are the men who put up the money. I want to ask you a
question. Do you think it would be very unfair if the owners of all
this automatically created land value due to the growth of the city, to
the enterprise of the community, and to the sacrifices made by the
shareholders -- do you think it would have been very unfair, if they
had been made to pay a proportion, at any rate, of the unearned
increment which they secured, back to the city and the community? ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
  <p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
    taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
    streams necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>
          2) upon our labor, or <br>
    3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
    of these parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is
    counted in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of
    capital (its liquid form) is in interest.</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of
    all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. To be sure many people have learned to position themselves in situations
    where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed these people
    come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</p>
  <p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
    principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. Land is classically taken
    to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space, in any
    medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
    the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms. One needs to return to 19th
    century classical economic definitions of the factors of production to appreciate
    the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.
    One should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical
    economic theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical
    economics. This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of
    academic economic history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one
    of the greatest, if very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Stuart Mill noted that</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of

should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today, on the other hand, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span

surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span

values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains

and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory &#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says

<blockquote>
  <p>    George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which
    every human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was fixed
    in
      supply, the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to
      enjoy exclusive rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer
      majority from land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners
      in order to access this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of
      rents by landowners allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing
      to the productive efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did
      the demand for land, forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition,
      increases in land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such
      as roads and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the
      expense of the community. Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged
      speculation in land, pushing prices even higher, while exposing the economy
      to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;.

  <p><br>
    Commons Rent</p>
  <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be, a money-free
    zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and the rest of us) to
    understand is commons rent.</p>
  <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord. In
    economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid because
    of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound puzzling, but
    consider this. A city has available a million apartments. In absolute terms,
    that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But the city is confined geographically
    and demand for apartments is intense. In this economic sense, apartments
    are scarce. Now think back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage
    you pay the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
    or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
    is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San Franciscans
    write such large checks to landlords and banks, while people in Nebraska
    don&#8217;t.</p>
  <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply. Rent
    due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can (and should)
    debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself arises automatically.
    And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because this helps the larger economy
    allocate scarce resources efficiently. Other methods of allocation are possible.
    We can distribute scarce things on a first come, first served basis, or by
    lottery, political power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though,
    that selling scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach,
    and such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
  <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam Smith, David
    Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because it constituted
    most of the money earned by landowners, and land was then a major cost of
    production. The supply of land, these economists noted, is limited, but demand
    for it steadily increases. So, therefore, does its rent. Thus, landowners
    benefit from what Mill called the unearned increment &#8212; the rise in
    land value attributable not to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially
    created increase in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
  <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further. Seeing
    both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked a logical question:
    Why does poverty persist despite economic growth? The answer, he believed,
    was the appropriation of rent by landowners. Even as the economy grew, the
    property rights system and the scarcity of land diverted almost all the gains
    to a landowning minority. Whereas competition limited the gains of working
    people, nothing kept down the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted,
    the value of their land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated
    a steep tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
    Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
    economists never took him seriously.</p>
  <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in rent;
    it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to capital and labor.
    But the twenty-first century ecological crisis brings rent back to center-stage.
    Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s scarce, but clean water, undisturbed
    habitat, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
  <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and allocation
    of property rights are the primary factors in determining who pays whom for
    what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution rights are given free
    to past polluters, the rent from the polluted ecosystem will also go to them.
    That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden products will rise as pollution
    is limited (remember, if demand is constant, a reduction in supply causes
    prices to go up), and those higher prices will flow to producers (which is
    to say, polluters).</p>
  <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
    and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
    the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If the
    trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures on
    public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
  <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting corporations
    are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts getting the
    rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers will pay commons
    rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves as beneficiaries
    of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will be the same, but his
    payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden products. The more
    he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back
    less than they put in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic
    incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
    incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s interest
    to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent for scarce things
    works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re
    a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake of argument) your
    responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations, you want to
    increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits you sell,
    or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you lower the number
    of permits. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
