<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial depression
      are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully solved, and the social
      phenomena which all over the civilized world appall the philanthropist and
      perplex the statesman, which hang with clouds the future of the most advanced
      races, and suggest doubts of the reality and ultimate goal of what we have
      fondly called progress, are now explained.</p>
  <p>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
      tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with increase
      in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
      constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.</p>
  <p>Land being necessary to labor, and being reduced to private ownership, every
      increase in the productive power of labor but increases rent &#8212; the
      price that labor must pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and
      thus all
      the advantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land,
      and wages do not increase.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">*Whatever be the fact as to wages, the reader will, of
            course, recognize that higher money wages which merely balance higher living
            costs, are not to be reckoned as real wage increases. H.G.B</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The simple theory which I have outlined (if indeed it can be called a theory
      which is but the recognition of the most obvious relations) explains this conjunction
      of poverty with wealth, of low wages with high productive power, of degradation
      amid enlightenment, of virtual slavery in political liberty.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It harmonizes, as results flowing from a general and inexorable law,
      facts otherwise most perplexing, and exhibits the sequence and relation
      between
          phenomena that without reference to it are diverse and contradictory.</li>
    <li> It explains why improvements which increase the productive power of
      labor and capital increase the reward of neither.</li>
    <li> It explains what is commonly called the conflict between labor and capital,
          while proving the real harmony of interest between them.</li>
    <li><strong> It cuts the last inch of ground from under the fallacies of protection,
          while showing why free trade fails to benefit permanently the working classes.</strong></li>
    <li> It explains why want increases with abundance, and wealth tends to greater
          and greater aggregations.</li>
    <li> It explains the vice and misery which show themselves amid dense population,
          without attributing to the laws of the All-Wise and All-Beneficent
      defects which belong only to the shortsighted and selfish enactments of
      men. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The truth is self-evident. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> LET us try to trace the genesis of civilization. Gifted alone with
  the power of relating cause and effect, man is among all animals the only producer
  in the true sense of the term. . . . But the same quality of reason which makes
  him the producer, also, wherever exchange becomes possible, makes him the exchanger.
  And it is along this line of exchanging that the body economic is evolved and
  develops, and that all the advances of civilization are primarily made. . .
  . With the beginning of exchange or trade among men this body economic begins
  to form, and in its beginning civilization begins. . . . To find an utterly
  uncivilized people, we must find a people among whom there is no exchange or
  trade. Such a people does not exist, and, as far as our knowledge goes, never
  did. To find a fully civilized people, we must find a people among whom exchange
  or trade is absolutely free, and has reached the fullest development to which
  human desires can carry it. There is, as yet, unfortunately, no such people. &#8212; <em>The

WHEN we, come to analyze production, we find it to fall into three modes, viz:: <br>
ADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so as to fit
them for the satisfaction of human desire. <br>
GROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising vegetables or
animals. <br>
EXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth, the higher
powers of those natural forces which vary with locality, or of those human forces
which vary with situation, occupation, or character. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html"> &#8212; Book
III, Chapter 3, The Laws of Distribution: of Interest and the Cause of Interest</a><br>
          <br>
THESE modes seem to appear and to assume importance, in the development of human
society, much in the order here given. They originate from the increase of the
desires of men with the increase of the means of satisfying them, under pressure
of the fundamental law of political economy, that men seek to satisfy their desires
with the least exertion. In the primitive stage of human life the readiest way
of satisfying desires is by adapting to human use what is found in existence.
In a later and more settled stage it is discovered that certain desires can be
more easily and more fully satisfied by utilizing the principle of growth and
reproduction, as by cultivating vegetables and breeding animals. And in a still
later period of development, it becomes obvious that certain desires can be better
and more easily satisfied by exchange, which brings out the principle of co-operation
more fully and powerfully than could obtain among unexchanging economic units. &#8212; <em>The

Part III, Chapter 2, The Production of Wealth: The Three Modes of Production</a></p>
  <p>ALL living things that we know of co-operate in some kind and to some degree.
    So far as we can see, nothing that lives can live in and for itself alone.
    But man is the only one who co-operates by exchanging, and he may be distinguished
    from all the numberless tribes that with him tenant the earth as the exchanging
    animal. . . . Exchange is the great agency by which what I have called the
    spontaneous or unconscious co-operation of men in the production of wealth
    is brought about, and economic units are welded into that social organism
    which is the Greater Leviathan. To this economic body, this Greater Leviathan,
    into which it builds the economic units, it is what the nerves or perhaps
    the ganglions are to the individual body. Or, to make use of another illustration,
    it is to our material desires and powers of satisfying them what the switchboard
    of a telegraph or telephone, or other electric system, is to that system,
    a means by which exertion of one kind in one place may be transmitted into
    satisfaction of another kind in another place, and thus the efforts of individual
    units be conjoined and correlated so as to yield satisfactions in most useful
    place and form, and to an amount enormously exceeding what otherwise would
    be possible. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

THE protection of the masses has in all times been the pretense of tyranny &#8212; the
plea of monarchy, of aristocracy, of special privilege of every kind. The slave
owners justified slavery as protecting the slaves. British misrule in Ireland
is upheld on the ground that it is for the protection of the Irish. But, whether
under a monarchy or under a republic, is there an instance in the history of
the world in which the "protection" of the laboring masses has not meant their
oppression? The protection that those who have got the law-making power into
their hands have given labor, has at best always been the protection that man
gives to cattle &#8212; he protects them that he may use and eat them. &#8212; <em>Protection

            <br>
IT is never intimated that the land-owner or the capitalist needs protection.
They, it is always assumed, can take care of themselves. It is only the poor
workingman who must be protected. What is labor that it should so need protection?
Is not labor the creator of capital, the producer of all wealth? Is it not the
men who labor that feed and clothe all others? Is it not true, as has been said,
that the three great orders of society are "workingmen, beggarmen, and thieves?" How,
then, does it come that workingmen alone need protection? &#8212; <em>Protection

WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a country which
should compel each family to keep constantly on their guard against every other
family, to expend a large part of their time and labor in preventing exchanges
with their neighbors, and to seek their own prosperity by opposing the natural
efforts of other families to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies
that laws such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families of
men who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws, as immutable
as the physical laws, each nation must stand jealously on guard against every
other nation and erect artificial obstacles to national intercourse.&#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 4: Protection as a Universal Need&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT4.html">econlib </a><br>
            <br>
TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying from other
nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make a man prosperous by preventing
him from buying from other men. How this operates in the case of the individual
we can see from that practice which, since its application in the Irish land
agitation, has come to be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has
been thrust the unenviable fame of having his name turned into a verb, was in
fact "protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind built
around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act of Parliament. No
one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk or bread or meat or any
service or commodity whatever. But instead of growing prosperous, this much-protected
man had to fly from a place where his own market was thus reserved for his own
productions. What protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home
market for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain Boycott.
They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

            <br>
WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to take a certain
course is proof that it ought to take that course, and restrictions are harmful
because they restrict, and in proportion as they restrict. To assert that the
way for men to become healthy and strong is for them to force into their stomachs
what nature tries to reject, to regulate the play of their lungs by bandages,
or to control the circulation of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit
more absurd than to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them
to restrict the natural tendency to trade. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

  <p>MEN of different nations trade with each other for the same reason that
    men of the same nation do &#8212; because they find it profitable; because
    they thus obtain what they want with less labor than they otherwise could. &#8212; <em>Protection

TRADE is not invasion. It does not involve aggression on one side and resistance
on the other, but mutual consent and gratification. There cannot be a trade unless
the parties to it agree, any more than there can be a quarrel unless the parties
to it differ. England, we say, forced trade with the outside world upon China
and the United States upon Japan. But, in both cases, what was done was not to
force the people to trade, but to force their governments to let them. If the
people had not wanted to trade, the opening of the ports would have been useless. &#8212; <em>Protection

&nbsp;<br>
TRADE does not require force. Free trade consists simply in letting people buy
and sell as they want to buy and sell.. It is protection that requires force,
for it consists in preventing people from doing what they want to do. &#8212; <em>Protection

IF all the material things needed by man could be produced equally well at all
points on the earth's surface, it might seem more convenient for man the animal,
but how would he have risen above the animal level? As we see in the history
of social development, commerce has been and is the great civilizer and educator.
The seemingly infinite diversities in the capacity of different parts of the
earth's surface lead to that exchange of productions which is the most powerful
agent in preventing isolation, in breaking down prejudice, in increasing knowledge
and widening thought. These diversities of nature, which seemingly increase with
our knowledge of nature's powers, like the diversities in the aptitudes of individuals
and communities, which similarly increase with social development, call forth
powers and give rise to pleasures which could never arise had man been placed
like an ox in a boundless field of clover. The "international law of God" which
we fight with our tariffs &#8212; so shortsighted are the selfish prejudices
of men &#8212; is the law which stimulates mental and moral progress; the law
to which civilization is due. &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social
Problems &#8212; Chapter 19: The First Great Reform. </a></p>
  <p>AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
    lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
    out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
    reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
    reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
    one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
    bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
    it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
    his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
    to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
    are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
    fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
    field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
    a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
    a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
    direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like the squirrel who buries
    his nuts and refrains from digging them up again. Lo! they sprout and grow
    into trees. In fine linen, steeped in costly spices, the mummy is laid away.
    Thousands and thousands of years thereafter, the Bedouin cooks his food by
    a fire of its encasings, it generates the steam by which the traveler is
    whirled on his way, or it passes into far-off lands to gratify the curiosity
    of another race. The bee fills the hollow tree with honey, and along comes
    the bear or the man. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>CONSIDER the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to
    the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for
    laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the
    labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment
    of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
    demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
    against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
    profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
    upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented

  <p><strong><font size="-1">2. THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
  <p>When considered in connection with primitive modes of production, the vital
    importance of this truth is self-evident. 55 If those modes prevailed, involuntary
    poverty would be readily traced either to direct enslavement through ownership
    of Labor, or to indirect enslavement through ownership of Land. 56 There
    could be no other cause. If both causes were absent, every individual might,
    if he wished, enjoy all the Wealth that his own powers were capable of producing
    in 'the primitive modes of production and under the limitations of common
    knowledge that belonged to his environment.57</p>
  <p>But in the civilized state this principle is so entangled in the complexities
    of division of labor and trade as to be almost lost in the maze. Many, even
    of those who recognize it, fail to grasp it as a fundamental truth. Yet it
    is no less vital in civilized than in primitive modes of production.</p>
  <p><strong><em>a. Division of Labor</em></strong></p>
  <p>The essential difference between primitive and civilized modes of production
    is not in the accumulation of capital which characterizes the latter, but
    in the greater scope and minuteness of its division of labor.58 Capital is
    an effect of division of labor rather than a cause. Division of labor, by
    enhancing labor power and relieving man from the perpetual pursuit of mere
    subsistence, utilizes capital and makes civilization possible.59</p>

        to do a mile to the east, and each has one to do a mile to the west.
        If each goes upon his own errand each will travel a mile out and a mile
        back in one direction and the same in the other, making four miles' travel
        apiece, or eight miles in all. But if one does both errands to the east
        and the other does both to the west, they will travel but two miles apiece,
        or four in all. By division of labor they free half their energy and
        half their time for devotion to other work, or to study, or to play,
        as their inclinations dictate.</font></p>

  <p>The productive power of division of labor may be illustrated by considering
    it as a means for utilizing differences of soil and climate. If, for example,
    the soil and the climate of two sections of a country, or of two different
    countries (for the effects of division of labor are not dependent upon political
    geography 60), differ inversely, one being better adapted to the production
    of corn than of sugar, and the other, on the contrary, being better adapted
    to the production of sugar than of corn, they will yield more wealth in corn
    and sugar with division of labor than without it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6o. No more than are the effects of a healthful climate.
        Protectionists who argue that there should be free trade between villages,
        cities, counties and states in the same nation, but protection for nations,
        thus making the effect of trade to depend upon the invisible political
        boundary line that separates communities, are like the colored woman
        who, when her house, without being physically removed, had been politically
        shifted from North Carolina to Virginia by a change of the boundary line,
        expressed her satisfaction in the remark that she was very glad of it,
        because she &quot;allus yearn tail dot dat yah Nof Kline was an a'mighty
        sickly State,&quot; and she was glad that she didn't &quot;live dyeah
        no me'!&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us imagine a Mainland and an Island, which, as to the adaptability of
    their soil and climate to the production of corn and sugar, so differ that
    if the people of each should raise their own corn and their own sugar they
    would produce, with a given unit of labor force, but 22 of Wealth &#8212; 11
    in corn and 11 in sugar. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Production in that manner would ignore the opportunities afforded by nature
    to man for utilizing differences of soil and climate; but by such a wise
    division as Labor would adopt in similar circumstances, if unrestrained,
    the same unit of labor force almost doubles the product. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Nor is it alone because it utilizes differences of soil and climate that
    division of labor is so effective. Its effectiveness is enhanced in still
    higher degree by its lessening of the labor force necessary to accomplish
    any industrial result, whether in mining, manufacturing, transporting, store-keeping,
    professional employments, agriculture, or the incidental occupations. Minute
    division of labor, instead of accounting for poverty in the civilized state,
    makes it all the more unaccountable. ...</p>
  <p><strong><em>b. Trade</em></strong></p>
  <p>But division of labor is dependent upon trade. If trade were wholly stopped
    there would be no division of labor; 61 if it be interfered with, division
    of labor is obstructed. 62 In the last preceding chart, which illustrates
    the effect of division of labor without trade, the Mainland gets 20 of corn,
    but no sugar, and the Island gets 20 of sugar, but no corn. Yet each wants
    both sugar and corn; and if they freely trade, their wants in these respects
    will be better satisfied than if each raises its own corn and sugar.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">61. Men who devoted themselves to specialties, unable to exchange their
        products for the objects of their desire, which alone would be the motive
        for their special labor, would abandon specialties and resort to less civilized
        methods of supplying their wants.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">62. Division of labor, whether adopted to take advantage of the different
        varieties of land or to secure the benefits of special skill in labor, cannot
        continue without trade; and to the degree that trade is impeded, to that
        degree division of labor will languish. It is only under absolute free trade
        between all people and in respect of all products that division of labor
        can flourish. Any interference with it is economically an enslavement of
        labor in a degree proportioned to the degree of interference.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Compare the first chart of this series with the following: 63 [chart]</p>
  <p>The comparison 64 illustrates the advantage to each individual, community
    and country, of division of labor and trade over more primitive modes of
    production. It is like the difference between raising weights by direct application
    of power, and by means of block and tackle.65</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">63. It will be seen from this chart that the people of
        the two places, by dividing their given expenditure of labor in such
        a manner as to utilize
        the natural advantage peculiar to each place, secure a clear profit of
      18.
        And this is a substantial profit, consisting not merely of figures upon
      paper, but of real wealth &#8212; artificial external objects which serve
      to satisfy human desires.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">64. The people of the Mainland have now sent 10 of their corn to the Island,
        and the people of the Island have paid for it by sending 10 of their sugar
        to the Mainland.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For simplicity. the cost of effecting the trade is omitted. It does not
        affect the principle. If the cost were so high that more sugar and corn could
        be got without division of labor than with, division of labor would be abandoned
        as unprofitable; if low enough to admit of any profit at all, the trading
        would go on, unless restrained, precisely as if it involved no cost. It may
        be well to state, however, that the nearer we get to no cost in trading,
        the better are we off. Hence, any tariff on trading, whether domestic or
        foreign, like railroad and shipping rates for freight, is prejudicial; for
        tariffs add to the cost of trading just as freight rates do. Protection has
        that for its object. When it does not add enough to the price of a foreign
        product to prevent importation it fails of its purpose. And though revenue
        tariffs have no such object they produce the same effect, only in minor degree.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">65. If every man were obliged, unassisted by the co-operation of others,
            to supply his own needs directly by his own labor, few could more than meagerly
            satisfy even the simplest of those desires which we have in common with lower
            animals. Though each labored diligently the aggregate of wealth would be
            exceedingly small compared with the necessities of those who wished to consume
            it, while in variety it would be very limited and in quality of the poorest
            kind. But by division of labor, which has been carried to marvelous lengths
            and is still developing, productive power is so enormously increased that
            the annual wealth products of the present time, in quantity and quality,
            in variety, usefulness and beauty, almost appear to be the work of giants
          and fairies.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And what this series of charts illustrates regarding two places and two
    forms of wealth, is true in principle of all places and all forms of wealth.
    That every one is better served when each does for others what relatively
    he does best, in exchange for what relatively they do best, is as true of
    communities and nations as it is of individuals. Indeed, it is true of communities
    and nations because it is true of individuals; for it is individuals that
    trade, and not communities or nations as such.66</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">66. Mankind as a whole may be likened to a great man, with
          eyes to see, brain to invent and direct, nerves for intercommunication,
          and various muscles
        for various actions. As different parts of the bodies of men do different
        things, each part contributing co-operatively to a general result, so it
        is with the body politic, whose different parts &#8212; individual men &#8212; contribute
        in different ways to the common good. Trade is to the body politic what digestion
        is to the physical body. To prohibit it is to deprive the great man of his
        stomach; to restrict it is to give him dyspepsia.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Says Emerson in the &quot;American Scholar,&quot; an oration delivered at
        Cambridge in 1837: &quot;It is one of those fables which out of an unknown
        antiquity convey an unlocked-for wisdom, that the gods, in the beginning,
        divided man into men, that he might be more helpful to himself; just as the
        hand was divided into fingers, the better to answer its ends.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Reflection upon the labor-saving power of trade makes it
          clear that the notion of protectionists that free trade is prejudicial
          to home industry
        has no foundation. It would interfere with &quot;home industries&quot; that
        could be better conducted elsewhere; but by that very fact it would strengthen
        the industries that belonged at home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">When we decide to buy foreign goods we do not thereby decide to employ foreign
        labor instead of American labor; we decide that the American labor shall

        the things that we buy. And we get a better net result or we wouldn't do
        it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Free trade and labor-saving machinery, which belong in the same industrial
        category, increase the aggregate wealth of the country where they flourish.
        Whether or not they tend to impoverish individuals or classes, depends upon
        the manner in which the increased wealth is distributed. If they do so tend,
        the remedy surely does not lie in the direction of obstructing trade and
        smashing machines so that less wealth may be produced with given labor, but
        in altering the conditions that promote unjust distribution.</font></p>

  <p><strong><em>c. The Law of Division of Labor and Trade</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is it that leads men to conform their conduct to the principle
    illustrated by the last chart? Why do they divide their labor, and trade
    its products? A simple, universal and familiar law of human nature moves
    them. Whether men be isolated, or be living in primitive communities, or
    in advanced states of civilization, their demand for consumption determines
    the direction of Labor in production.67 That is the law. Considered in connection
    with a solitary individual, like Robinson Crusoe upon his island, it is obvious.
    What he demanded for consumption he was obliged to produce. Even as to the
    goods he collected from stranded ships &#8212; desiring to consume them,
    he was obliged to labor to produce them to places of safety. His demand for
    consumption always determined the direction of his labor in production.68
    And when we remember that what Robinson Crusoe was to his island in the sea,
    civilized man as a whole is to this island in space, we may readily understand
    the application of the same simple law to the great body of labor in the
    civilized world.69 Nevertheless, the complexities of civilized life are so
    likely to obscure its operation and disguise its relations to social questions
    like that of the persistence of poverty as to make illustration desirable.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">67. The term &quot; production&quot; means not creation
        but adaptation. Man cannot add an atom to the universe of matter; but
        he can so modify
      the condition of matter, both in respect of form and of place, as to adapt
      it
        to the satisfaction of human desires. To do this is to produce wealth.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Consumption&quot; is the ultimate object of all
        production. We produce because we desire to consume. But consumption
        does not mean destruction.
        Man has no more power to destroy than to create. His power in consumption,
        like his power in production, is limited to changing the condition of
      things. As by production man changes things from natural to artificial
      conditions
        to satisfy his desires, so by consumption he changes things from artificial
        to natural conditions in the process of satisfying his desires.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Production is the drawing forth of desired things, of Wealth, from the Land;
        consumption is the returning back of those things to the Land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;All labor is but the movement of particles of matter from one place
        to another.&quot; &#8212; Dick's Outlines, p. 25.</font></p>

        Intro., part ii, ch. i; Mill's Prin., book i, ch. i, sec. 2.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;As man creates no new matter but only utilities, so he destroys no
        matter, but only utilities. Consumption means the destruction of a utility.&quot; &#8212; Ely's
        Intro., part v. ch. i., p. 268.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Production means &quot;drawing forth.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 17.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Man cannot create material things. . . His efforts and sacrifices
        result in changing the form or arrangement of matter to adapt it better for
        the satisfaction of wants.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book ii, ch.
        iii, sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is sometimes said that traders do not produce; that while the cabinet
        maker produces furniture, the furniture dealer merely sells what is already
        produced. But there is no scientific foundation for this distinction.&quot; &#8212; Id.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;As his [man's] production of material products is really nothing more
        than a rearrangement of matter which gives it new utilities, so his consumption
        of them is nothing more than a disarrangement of matter which diminishes
        or destroys its utilities.&quot; &#8212; Id.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;In like manner as by production is meant the creation not of substance
        but of utility, so by consumption is meant the destruction of utility and
        not of substance or matter.&quot; &#8212; Say's Trea., book ii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;All that man can do is to reproduce existing materials under another
        form, which may give them a utility they did not before possess, or merely
        enlarge one they may have before presented. So that in fact there is a creation
        not of matter but of utility ; and this I call production of wealth. . .
        There is no actual production of wealth without a creation or augmentation
        of utility.&quot;&#8212; Say's Trea., book i, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">68. It is highly significant that while Robinson Crusoe had unsatisfied
        wants he was never out of a job.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">69. Demand for consumption is satisfied not from hoards of accumulated wealth,
        but from the stream of current production. Broadly speaking there can be
        no accumulation of wealth in the sense of saving up wealth from generation
        to generation. Imagine a man's satisfying his demand for eggs from the accumulated
        stores of his ancestors! Yet eggs do not differ in this respect from other
        forms of wealth, except that some other forms will keep a little longer,
        and some not so long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The notion that a saving instinct must be aroused before
        the great and more lasting forms of wealth can be brought forth is a
        mistake. Houses and locomotives,
        for example, are built not because of any desire to accumulate wealth,
        but because we need houses to live in and locomotives to transport us
        and our
        goods. It is not the saving, but the serving, instinct that induces the
        production of these things; the same instinct that induces the production
        of a loaf of bread.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Artificial things do not save. No sooner are the processes of production
        from land complete than the products are on their way back to the land. If
        man does not return them by means of consumption, then through decay they
        return themselves. Mankind as a whole lives literally from hand to mouth.
        What is demanded for consumption in the present must be produced by the labor
        of the present. From current production, and from that alone, can current
        consumption be satisfied.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Accumulated wealth&quot; is, in fact, not wealth
        at all in any great degree. It is merely titles to wealth yet to be produced.
        A share in
      a mining company, for example, is but a certificate that the owner is legally
      entitled
        to a proportion of the wealth to be produced in the future from a certain
        mine.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Titles to future wealth may be both morally and legally valid. This is so
        when they represent past labor or its products loaned in free contract for
        future labor or its products; for example, a contract for the delivery of
        goods of any kind today to be paid for next week. or next month, or next
        year, or in ten years, or later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">They may be legally but not morally valid. This is so when they represent
        the product of a franchise (whether paid for in labor or not) to exact tribute
        from future labor; for example, a franchise to confiscate a man's labor through
        ownership of his body, as in slavery, or a franchise to confiscate the products
        of labor in general through ownership of land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Or they may be both legally and morally invalid, as when
        they are obtained by illegal force or fraud from the rightful owner.

  <p>The poverty of Food-makers as to clothing is thus removed. They are working
    all they care to at food-making, their own chosen employment, and they are
    paid in clothing, their own chosen compensation. So long as Personal Servants
    withdraw food and Clothing-makers supply clothing, Food-makers cannot be
    poor. With them business will be brisk, labor will be in demand, and wages
    will be high. That all the other workers may enjoy the same prosperity we
    shall see in a moment. Clothing-makers pour clothing into the commercial
    reservoir because they wish to take something out, and know that in this
    way they can get a larger quantity and better quality of what they require
    than if they undertake to make it themselves. They are skilled in making
    clothing; they are not skilled in other ways. Accordingly they utilize the
    claim against Personal Servants, which has passed to their credit in exchange
    for clothing, by drawing from the commercial reservoir the particular commodity
    they desire. Suppose it to be shelter. They proceed as Personal Servants
    and Food-makers have already done, and so set Shelter-makers at work. Shelter-makers
    in turn utilize the claim against Personal Servants which has now been credited
    to them, by taking luxuries out of the reservoir. This sets Luxury-makers
    at work. Luxury-makers then pass the claim over in exchange for services,
    and Personal Servants redeem it by rendering such services as Luxury-makers
    demand.72 Everybody is now paid for his own products with the products of
    others; and by demanding more food, Personal Servants may perpetuate the
    interchange indefinitely.73 And Personal Servants will continue to demand
    more food until their wants as to food are wholly and finally satisfied.74</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">72. The mechanism of these exchanges should be explained.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Personal Servants upon demanding food may pay money for
        it. The retailers might thereupon pass the money along, and it would
        ultimately return to Personal Servants. Or the Personal Servants may
        give notes payable at a future time, which being endorsed over would
        at last be redeemed by them in services. Or they may give checks on banks,
        which assumes previous work done by them or the discounting of their
        notes by the banks. As the world's exchanges are almost wholly adjusted
        by means of checks, and other commercial paper which is in economic effect
        the same as checks, let us illustrate that mode by a series of charts
        adapted from Jevons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">We will begin with two traders, A and B. They have no
        money, but every time that one demands anything of the other he must
        offer in exchange something that the other wants. There must be what
        is called &quot;a double coincidence&quot; of demand and supply; each
        must want what the other has. This is primitive barter. It may be represented
        by the following chart :</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In the civilized state, even in its beginnings, primitive
        barter must be obstructive to trade, and it gives way to the use of currency &#8212; some
        common medium which is taken for goods not because the taker wants it
        but because he knows that be can readily exchange it for the goods that
        he does want. With currency in use, when A wants anything of B he is
        not obliged to find something that B wants. All he needs is currency.
        Thus currency reduces the friction of trading.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But as the volume of trade augments, demand for currency
        increases; and because it is scarce, or troublesome or dangerous to transmit,
        or all together, easier means of exchange are resorted to, and bookkeeping
        takes the place of currency as currency took the place of primitive barter.
        At this stage, when A wants anything of B, B charges him; and when B
        wants anything of A, A charges him. Their mutual accounts being adjusted,
        the small balance is paid with currency. Thus the demand for currency
        is greatly lowered by bookkeeping, and the friction of trading is correspondingly
        reduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now let us bring in two more traders, C and D:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Though all four of these traders keep mutual accounts,
        the settlement of balances requires more currency than before, and scarcity
        of currency, together with the danger and expense of transmission, evolves
        an extension of bookkeeping. A common bookkeeper, called a &quot;Bank,&quot; is
        employed, and all need for currency disappears:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Balances are now settled by checks, and all accounts are
        adjusted in the central ledger at the bank.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But the introduction of another group of traders, another
        community, renews the demand for currency, and another bank appears.
        Thus:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And now the two banks are in the same position that A
        and B were in before any bank came. They keep mutual accounts, but they
        must have currency to settle their balances. And if we bring in more
        communities the demand for currency further increases. Thus:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now the four banks are in the same situation that A, B,
        C and D were in before there were any banks. This evolves a bank of banks &#8212; a
        clearing-house.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">All necessity for currency once more disappears.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">These charts illustrate the principle by which mutual
        trading is effected. In practice, the need of currency is never wholly
        done away with, but the tendency is constantly in the direction of doing
        away with it. And it is said that over ninety per cent of the trading
        transactions of the world are adjusted in this manner, and less than
        ten per cent by means of currency.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The clearing-house principle extends over the civilized
        world. In illustration of this, observe the following chart:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"><br>
    These five cities are like the five banks. The bookkeeping of each city is
        conducted by local banks and clearing-houses, and the central bookkeeping
        by those of the market town of the world, which at present is London.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In this way the mobility of labor is in effect enormously
        increased. Labor in every corner of the world is brought into close trading

        Clothing-makers demand more shelter, which keeps Shelter-makers at work;
        Shelter-makers demand more luxuries, which keeps Luxury-makers at work;

        poverty upon the increase, instead of being harried by periodical &quot;hard
        times,&quot; we shall find business brisk and every one becoming richer
        and richer. That is to say, though all labor less than before, each obtains
        better results from others while giving better results in exchange.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And should we improve the verisimilitude of the illustration
        by bringing in the fact that all workers in civilized society are specialists
        in a much more minute degree than the division into Clothing-makers,
        Food-makers, etc., would imply &#8212; that every one who works does
        over and over some one thing in one of these branches, as the making
        of shoes or the baking of bread, or even only part of a thing, as the
        cutting of shoe soles, and that while giving out a great deal of his
        own product he demands in pay a little of every other kind of product &#8212; the
        same effect would naturally result.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Every man who demands anything for consumption thereby
        determines the direction of labor toward the production not only of that
        thing, but also of all the artificial materials and implements, from
        the simplest tool to the most expensive and complex machine, that are
        used in its production. The actual process is much more intricate than
        that of the charts, but the charts illustrate the principle so that any
        intelligent person who understands them can apply &#8212; it to the most
        complex affairs of industrial life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This principle is so simple and obvious that it
        needs no further illustration, yet in its light all the complexities
        of our subject disappear, and we thus reach the same view of the real
        objects and rewards of labor in the intricacies of modern production
        that we rained by observing in the first beginnings of society the simpler
        forms of production and exchange. We see that now, as then, each laborer
        is endeavoring to obtain by his exertions the satisfaction of his own
        desires; we see that although the minute division of labor assigns to
        each producer the production of but a small part, or perhaps nothing
        at all, of the particular things he labors to get, yet, in aiding in
        the production of what other producers want, he is directing other labor
        to the production of the things he wants &#8212; in effect, producing
        them himself. And thus, if he makes jackknives and eats wheat, the wheat
        is really as much the produce of his labor as if he had grown it for
        himself and left wheat-growers to make their own jackknives.&quot; &#8212; Progress

        but adornment; the rude shelter becomes a house; the undiscriminating
        sexual attraction begins to transmute itself into subtle influences,

  <p>Let us now complete this chart. When we began it a distinction was noted
    between Personal Servants, who render mere intangible services, and the other
    classes, who produce tangible wealth. But essentially there is no difference.
    By referring to the chart and observing the course of the arrows, Food-makers
    are seen working for Personal Servants precisely as Personal Servants work
    for Luxury-makers. We may therefore abandon the distinction. This makes it
    no longer necessary to mention particular classes of products in the chart;
    it is enough to distinguish the different kinds of labor.76 Thus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">76. &quot;This, then, we may say is the great law which
        binds society &#8212; 'service for service.' &quot;&#8212; Dick's Outlines,
        p. 9.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For simplicity the workers have been divided into great classes, and each
    class has been supposed to serve only one other class. But the actual currents
    of trade are much more complex. It would be practically impossible to follow
    them in detail, or to illustrate their particular movements in any simple
    way. And it is unnecessary. The principle illustrated in the chart is the
    principle of all division of labor and trade, however minute the details
    and intricate the movement; and any person of ordinary intelligence who wishes
    to understand will need only to grasp the principle as illustrated by the
    chart to be able to apply it to the experiences of everyday industrial life.
    All legitimate trade is the interchange of Labor for Labor.77</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">77. In the light of this principle how absurd are some
        of the explanations of hard times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Overproduction! when an infinite variety of wants are
        unsatisfied which those who are in want are anxious and able to satisfy
        for one another. Hatters want bread, and bakers want hats, and farmers
        want both, and they all want machines, and machinists want bread and
        hats and machines, and so on without end. Yet while men are against their
        will in partial or complete idleness, their wants go unsatisfied! Since
        producers are also consumers, and production is governed by demand for
        consumption, there can be no real overproduction until demand ceases.
        The apparent overproduction which we see &#8212; overproduction relatively
        to &quot;effective demand&quot; &#8212; is in fact a congestion of some
        things due to an abnormal underproduction of other things, the underproduction
        being caused by obstructions in the way of labor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Scarcity of capital! when makers of capital in all its
        forms are involuntarily idle. Scarcity of capital, like scarcity of money,
        is only an expression for lack of employment. But why should there be
        any lack of employment while men have unsatisfied wants which they can
        reciprocally satisfy?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Too much competition! when competition and freedom are
        the same. It is not freedom but restraint, not competition but protection,
        that obstructs the action and reaction of demand and supply which we

Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, what is the effect on
production of taxes levied on
products and of taxes levied on the value of land? </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of taxes levied on products,
George said: "The present method of
taxation operates upon exchange like artificial deserts and
mountains; it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it
does to carry them around the world. It operates upon energy, and
industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities. If
I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me
more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while
you are exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his
temerity, as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad
be opened, down comes the taxcollector upon it, as though it were a
public nuisance; if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an
annual sum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say
we want capital, but if anyone accumulate it, or bring it among us,
we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We
punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
grain, we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.
How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have
attempted to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications,
for, as I have before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that
which falls in increased prices" (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 434). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turning to taxation levied on the
value of land, George went on to
say: </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For this simple device of placing
all taxes on the value of land
would be in effect putting up the land at auction to whosoever would
pay the highest rent to the state. The demand for land fixes its
value, and hence, if taxes were placed so as very nearly to consume
that value, the man who wished to hold land without using it would
have to pay very nearly what it would be worth to anyone who wanted
to use it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And it must be remembered that
this would apply, not merely to
agricultural land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open
to use, just as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one
could afford to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the
outskirts to demand more for it than the use to which it could at the
time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had attained a value,
taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
would operate to force improvement (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 437). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A few pages before this he had
told us that, "It is sufficiently
evident that with regard to production, the tax upon the value of
land is the best tax that can be imposed. Tax manufactures, and the
effect is to check manufacturing; tax improvements, and the effect is
to lessen improvement; tax commerce, and the effect is to prevent
exchange; tax capital, and the effect is to drive it away. But the
whole value of land may be taken in taxation, and the only effect
will be to stimulate industry, to open new opportunities to capital,
and to increase the production of wealth" (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 414).
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In other words, according to
George, taxation of products checks
production, whereas taxation of land values stimulates
production.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">FREE
TRADE OR PROTECTION?</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"That's
free enterprise, friends: freedom to gamble, freedom to lose. And the
great thing -- the truly democratic thing about it -- is that you don't
even have to be a player to lose." </span>- Barbara Ehrenreich (1941-
), American author and columnist
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Lots of provisos can be added later, but this is the basic
position: we
believe in free trade only if it's fair trade. Today it's is hardly
ever fair and it's far from free, since it is dominated by ruling
monopolies in all the larger economies such as the US, Japan, Germany,
the UK, etc - but it can be.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The great advantages of free trade were never more eloquently
spelt out
than by Henry George himself, but these benefits have been overshadowed
and confused by the way the threatening aspects of globalisation have
spread in recent years. Globalisation has appeared all the more
menacing because of the way the plutocrats who control transnational
organisations have been calling for the last barriers to free trade to
be removed. The trouble is, they don't give a damn about freedom!
Instead of allowing real free trade, the big boys seek to further
strengthen their monopoly privileges and political influence in order
to produce greater disparities in wealth.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">MANY DISADVANTAGES OF FREE TRADE</span></small><br>
<small>Cultural diversity is one of the things that undoubtedly makes
life
more interesting, and its erosion by unrestrained free trade would be
an irretrievable loss. Who wants McDonald's and other global chain
stores in every shopping centre? This evaluation obviously requires
difficult value judgments to be weighed against the possible economic
benefits. But cultural heritage and diversity have been grossly
undervalued by the bean counters who ignore it for not having a $ tag
on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>National independence and security can be threatened by free
trade, in
that a country can become too dependent on trading partners to provide
essential goods and services up to basic foodstuffs.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are often hidden environmental costs to free trade,
especially
when goods are transported over vast distances and exporters are not
paying the full costs of using scarce resources and of polluting the
global commons. Furthermore, recent trade agreements have been based on
environmental standards coming down to the lowest common denominator
when they could just as easily have been based on the highest.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Perhaps the loudest outcry against free trade and globalisation
has
been against the increasing exploitation by transnationals of "factory
fodder" in developing nations. Even the threat of the physical transfer
of industrial plant to low wage countries further erodes the bargaining
power and wages of workers in the West.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And transnationals can bully their way and dominate markets with
monopoly or cartel powers, often playing off nations against each other
to extract all sorts of tax concessions. But, when the time comes to
pay what little tax is owed, transfer pricing allows them to shift
their profits to low-taxing offshore locations. Furthermore, the rapid
movement of capital in and out of nations exacerbates economic
uncertainty and instability.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BUT DON'T DISCOUNT ECONOMIC
PROSPERITY!</span></small><br>
<small>Having made these admissions, we must hasten to add that free
trade has
given rise to enormous economic prosperity. The efficiencies from fully
utilising each nation's natural advantages are evident in any
supermarket or electrical goods store. Self-sufficiency has enormous
costs, keeping people working far longer than they need to. Those who
cry loudest for protectionist policies are often the most wasteful and
inept domestic producers, who are effectively subsidised by the public.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But will Geonomics address the current problems of free trade,
and
bring about fair trade? Let's examine the problems one by one.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW GEONOMICS FITS IN</span></small><br>
<small>Concerning the erosion of cultural diversity, Geonomics can help
a
little. The LVT assessment process can assist in quantifying the
intangible cultural benefits of, say, retaining a traditional inn
rather than replacing it with a global-franchise motel. In the end each
community, knowing the cultural costs of certain moves towards free
trade, would decide how badly it wants to preserve its culture and how
far to cash in on it without underselling its cultural heritage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Geonomics would easily solve the rest of the problems arising
from free
trade. The collection of full resource rentals would prevent any
underselling of the environment. Exploitation of Third World factory
fodder could never continue after addressing the root cause of
unemployment. The way Geonomics opens up a multitude of domestic
investment opportunities in both the public and private sectors would
no longer coerce developing countries to beg for investment by
transnational monopolies. And transnational tax avoidance would most
clearly end - no one can hide land or evade the tax assessed on it!</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Bring almost any article of
wealth to this country from a foreign
country, and you are confronted at once with a tax. Is it not from a
common sense standpoint a stupid thing, if we want more
wealth &#8212; if the prosperous country is the country that increases
in wealth, why in Heaven's name should we put up a barrier against
the men who want to bring wealth into this country? We want more
dry-goods (if you don't know, your wives surely will tell you). We
want more clothing; more sugar; more of all sorts of the good things
that are called "goods;" and yet by this system of taxation
we virtually put up a high fence around the country to keep out these
very things. We tax that convenient man who brings goods into the

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>During the late 19th century,
the burden of various direct taxes was
not so large that many common people felt their acute impact. It was,
however, a time of extreme disparities between the poor and the
wealthy, and the single tax was a means by which to redress some of
those disparities. It would also foster the availability of employment
by making labor more attractive relative to land and capital
investment. In a word, people would more likely have to earn their
money. The fruits of land wealth, distributed among people equally in
the form of government services, would go far toward both enhancing
economic opportunity and correcting inequality. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Georgists today adhere to much the same points of view, although
there
are some significant differences. <span style="font-weight: bold;">George
himself was an ardent free
trader, mainly because he believed that the single tax should supplant
tariffs</span>. After Ricardo, he accepted the idea of comparative
advantage
that arose from trade, but only after land (resource) rents were
collected so as to preclude the raping of the natural environments of
countries rich in such resources. He also believed that population
growth was good &#8212; the more the better, and took special pains to refute
Malthus. But one should also recall that he was living at a time when
the expanse of the American continent was still open to any homesteader
who chose to do so. Population growth was not a problem at that time.
These elements of George&#8217;s thought are inconsequential to his
followers today. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet it is important
to note that Georgists are not socialists; they do not
subscribe to the view that society should own the means of production.
These should remain privately owned by and large (except perhaps as
today&#8217;s economic theory would call for, i.e., natural monopolies,
public goods, and other government instruments). They are, rather,
free-marketers in the full sense of the world, even more ardently than
many contemporary American conservatives.</span> He believed that
removing the
accretion of economic rent from landsites would restore self-regulating
equilibrium of the marketplace, thus obviating the need for the heavy
hand of government controls. ... <a

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
    upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... The second principle to which I wish to refer is Henry George's advocacy
      of freedom of trade among the nations &#8212; not free trade introduced overnight,
      but freedom of trade as an end toward which the nations should move. When he
      wrote his great work on &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; he demolished
      the protectionist argument and in chapter after chapter he showed the absurdities
      to which the protectionist principle led if carried to its logical conclusion.
      But even he, penetrating as his vision was, could not foresee that mankind
      was heading for a world order of economic nationalism and isolation, based
      upon the principle of protection carried to its utmost extreme. And yet
      that it is precisely the doctrine which is now currently accepted. If it
      becomes
      general, it can serve only to sow the seeds of destruction of that measure
      of civilization which we now have and force a lowering of the standard
      of living throughout the world.</p>
  <p>There are two ways by which the people of one nation can acquire the property
      or goods of the people of another nation. These are by war and by trade. There
      are no other methods. The present tendency among civilized people to outlaw
      trade must drive the states which prescribe such outlawry to acquire the property
      and goods of other peoples by war. Early in man's struggle for existence the
      resort to war was the common method adopted. With the advancement of civilization
      men resorted to trade as a practical substitute for war. The masses of men
      wish to trade with one another. The action of the states alone prevents them
      from so doing. In prohibiting trade, the state gives an importance to territorial
      boundaries which would not exist if freedom of trade existed. In accentuating
      the importance of mere boundary disputes, rather than assuring the right of
      peoples to trade with one another, the nations put the emphasis upon the precise
      issue which is, itself, one of the most prolific causes of war.</p>
  <p>All the great modern states are turning away from freedom of trade, and indeed,
      from trade itself, and forbidding their people the right to earn their own
      livelihood and to associate freely with one another in industry. In order to
      accomplish this end they are compelled to regiment the lives of their people
      under state bureaucracies and this can be accomplished only by a despotic state.
      If the powers of the modern states are to be augmented by conferring upon them
      the right to run all industry, despotism is inevitable. A dictator may, by
      reducing the standard of living and regimenting the people, run all industry
      within the state over which he rules, but a democracy, which, if it is to be
      true to itself, must preserve individual initiative, can not do so without
      transforming itself into a dictatorship. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p>George was moreover the terror of the political routineer. When the Republicans
      suddenly raised the tariff issue in 1880 the Democratic committee asked him
      to go on the stump. They arranged a long list of engagements for him, but after
      he made one speech they begged him by telegraph not to make any more. The nub
      of his speech was that he had heard of high-tariff Democrats and revenue-tariff
      Democrats, but he was a no-tariff Democrat who wanted real free trade, and
      he was out for that or nothing; and naturally no good bi-partisan national
      committee could put up with such talk as that, especially from a man who really
      meant it.</p>
  <p>Yet, on the other hand, when the official free-traders of the Atlantic seaboard,
      led by Sumner, Godkin, Beecher, Curtis, Lowell, and Hewitt, opened their
    arms to George, he refused to fall in. His free-trade speeches during Cleveland&#8217;s
      second campaign were really devoted to showing by implication that they were
      a hollow lot, and that their idea of free trade was nothing more or less than
      a humbug. His speeches hurt Cleveland more than they helped him, and some of
      George&#8217;s closest associates split with him at this point. In George&#8217;s
      view, freedom of exchange would not benefit the masses of the people a
      particle unless it were correlated with freedom of production; if it would,
      how was
      it that the people of free-trade England, for example, were no better off
      than the people of protectionist Germany! None of the official free-traders
      could
      answer that question, of course, for there was no answer. George had already
      developed his full doctrine of trade in a book, published in 1886, called <em>Protection
      or Free Trade</em> &#8212; a book which, incidentally, gives a reader the
      best possible introduction to <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a><br>
