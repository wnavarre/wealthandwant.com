<blockquote>
  <p>As a young person, I couldn't imagine a drearier topic than public
    finance. But I've come to realize that how we finance our public spending
    is of vital
    importance. If we tax the <em>wrong</em> things, we throw a wet blanket on
    our economy and we steal from those who work the fruits of their labor. Equally
    important,
    if we <em>fail to tax</em> the right things, we allow some of us to enrich
    themselves unjustly at the expense of others.</p>
  <p>A significant portion of our extremely skewed distribution of income and our
    even more skewed distribution of wealth can be attributed to these two failures.</p>
  <p>And yet, when Americans discuss tax &quot;reform,&quot; it is usually either
    (a) a discussion of income tax brackets or (b) a discussion of so-called &quot;double
    taxation.&quot; Occasionally
      it veers into a suggestion that the poor aren't paying their &quot;fair
      share.&quot;</p>
  <p>There has been talk about budgets being moral documents. Usually the reference
    is to the <em><strong>spending</strong></em> side of the budget, but it is equally true of the <em><strong>revenue</strong></em>    side of the budget: there are things we shouldn't tax at all, or should only
    tax when we've already taxed those things that <em>should</em> be taxed,
    and, conversely, there are things that we must tax, if we want a just society.
    But few of our college economics curricula even mention this.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed in using
    the rent of land to finance public activities applies to certain other sources
    of public revenue as well:</small>
    <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such as
        the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for radio
        and TV broadcasts. </small>
        <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such payments
            should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible revenue
            of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
            pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the estimated
            cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution on the
            rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its cost.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental value
            of surrounding land.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in crowded
            streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for others.
            The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it is
            not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be handled
            sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent that
            they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
            which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water, electricity,
            sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to make every
            service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable is that
            each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service he
            receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
            increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs
            not covered by user charges.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land, at
            a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
            tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
            to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements).
            He pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who
            wishes to may take over possession at that price. The value of such
            a tax is that it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment,
            and to identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
            purposes.</small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
          of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be collected
          even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any excess can
          be returned to the population on an equal per capita basis. </span>If
          these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to finance necessary
          public expenditures, then the least damaging additional tax would probably
          be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on all residents. If some residents
          are regarded to be incapable of paying such a tax, then the next most
          efficient tax is a proportional tax on income up to some specified
          amount. Then there is no disincentive effect for all persons who reach
          the tax limit. The next most efficient tax is a proportional tax on
          all income.</small></p>
    <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax the
          profits of corporations</span>. Capital moves from where it is taxed
          to where it is not, until the same rate of return is earned everywhere.

    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The optimal timing of development is an important allocative function that
      can be either enhanced or degraded by the impact of land taxes on land
    speculation. This paper discusses four types of
    taxes on land: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>taxes on the rental value of land, </li>
    <li>taxes on the sale value of land, </li>
    <li>taxes on realized income from land, and </li>
    <li>taxes on realized gains from the sale of land. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All four taxes reduce incentives for speculation in land, which is generally
    beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with respect to incentives
    to develop land, while the first and second do not. All four taxes have some
    beneficial effect of mitigating imperfections in capital markets. All permit
    reduction or elimination of taxes with significant dead-weight losses, such
    as those on improvements. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
