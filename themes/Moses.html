  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE HONOR LIBERTY in name and in
form. We set up her statues and sound
her praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so
grow her demands. She will have no half service! Liberty! it is a word
to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings. For Liberty
means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law of health and
symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small> They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission
when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the
ballot, who think of her as having no further relations to the
everyday affairs of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to
them the poets who have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her
martyrs fools!&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small> It is not for an abstraction that men have
toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty have
stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have suffered. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth,
knowledge, invention, national strength and national independence as
other things. But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother,
the necessary condition. </span>She is to virtue what light is to
color; to
wealth what sunshine is to grain; to knowledge what eyes are to
sight. She is the genius of invention, the brawn of national
strength, the spirit of national independence. Where Liberty rises,
there virtue grows, wealth increases, knowledge expands, invention
multiplies human powers, and in strength and spirit the freer nation
rises among her neighbors as Saul amid his brethren &#8212; taller and
fairer. Where Liberty sinks, there virtue fades, wealth diminishes,
knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and empires once mighty in
arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer barbarians! </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Liberty came to a race of
slaves crouching under Egyptian whips,
and led them forth from the House of Bondage. She hardened them in
the desert and made of them a race of conquerors. The free spirit of
the Mosaic law took their thinkers up to heights where they beheld
the unity of God, and inspired their poets with strains that yet
phrase the highest exaltations of thought. ... <a

  Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/Moses.html">Moses,
Apostle of Freedom</a>&nbsp; (1878 speech)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/Moses_apostle_of_freedom.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a>
    <small> Each recurring year brings a day
        on which, in every land, there
        are men who, gathering about them their families, and attired as if
        for a journey, eat with solemnity a hurried meal. Before the walls of
        Rome were traced, before Homer sung, this feast was kept, and the
    event to which it points was even then centuries old. </small>
  </p>
  </p>
  <small>That event signals the entrance
upon the historic stage of a
people on many accounts remarkable &#8211; a people: </small></blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><small>who, though they
    never founded a great empire nor built a great metropolis, have
    exercised upon a large portion of humankind an influence, widespread,
    potent, and continuous; 
      </small></li>
  <li><small>who have for nearly two thousand years been
    without country or organised nationality, yet have preserved their
    identity and faith through all vicissitudes of time and fortune; 
      </small></li>
  <li><small>who
    have been overthrown, crushed, scattered; who have been ground, as it
    were, to very dust, and flung to the four winds of heaven; 
      </small></li>
  <li><small>yet who,
    though thrones have fallen, and empires have perished, and creeds
    have changed, and living tongues have become dead, still exist with a
    vitality seemingly unimpaired. 
      </small></li>
  <li><small>They are a people who unite the
    strangest contradictions; and whose annals now blaze with glory, now
    sound the depths of shame and woe. </small>
      <p>
</ul>
      <small> The advent of such a people marks
      an epoch in the history of the
      world. But it is not of that advent as much as of the central and
      colossal figure around which its traditions cluster that I propose to
      speak. </small>
      </p>
      </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Three great religions place the leader of the Exodus upon the
      highest plane they allot to humankind.</span> To Christendom and to
      Islam,
      as well as to Judaism, Moses is the mouthpiece and lawgiver of the
      Most High; the medium, clothed with supernatural powers, through
  which the divine will has spoken.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> No matter how clearly the
descendants of the kinsfolk, who came
into Egypt, at the invitation of the boy-slave become prime minister,
maintained the distinction of race and the traditions of a freer
life, they must have been powerfully affected by such a civilisation;
and just as the Hebrews of today are Polish in Poland, German in
Germany, and American in the United States, so, but far more clearly
and strongly, the Hebrews of the Exodus must have been essentially
Egyptian. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is not remarkable, therefore,
that the ancient Hebrew
institutions show in so many points the influence of Egyptian ideas
and customs. What is remarkable is the dissimilarity. To the
unreflecting nothing may seem more natural than that a people, in
turning their backs upon a land where they had been long oppressed,
should discard its ideas and institutions. But the student of
history, the observer of politics, knows that nothing is more
unnatural. Habits of thought are even more tyrannous than habits of
the body. They make for the masses of people a mental atmosphere out
of which they can no more rise than out of the physical atmosphere. A
people long used to despotism may rebel against a tyrant; they may
break his statutes and repeal his laws, cover with odium that which
he loved, and honour that which he hated; but they will hasten to set
up another tyrant in his place. A people used to superstition may
embrace a purer faith, but it will be only to degrade it to their old
ideas. A people used to persecution may flee from it, but only to
persecute in their turn when they get power.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The outlines that the record
gives us of the character of Moses
&#8211; the brief relations that wherever the Hebrew scriptures are
read have hung the chambers of the imagination with vivid pictures
&#8211; are in every way consistent with this idea. What we know of
the life illustrates what we know of the work. What we know of the
work illumines the life. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It was not an empire such as had
reached full development in
Egypt, or existed in rudimentary patriarchal form in the tribes
around, that Moses aimed to found. Nor was it a republic where the
freedom of the citizen rested on the servitude of the helot, and the
individual was sacrificed to the state. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
was a commonwealth based upon the individual</span> &#8211; a
commonwealth whose ideal it was that every man should sit under his
own vine and fig tree, with none to vex him or make him afraid. It
was a commonwealth: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>in which none should be condemned to ceaseless
toil; in which, for even the bond slave, there should be hope; and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>in
which, for even the beast of burden, there should be rest. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A
commonwealth in which, in the absence of deep poverty, the many
virtues that spring from personal independence should harden into a
national character&#8211;    </small></li>
  <li><small>a commonwealth in which the family
affections might knit their tendrils around each member, binding with
links stronger than steel the various parts into the living whole. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It is not the protection of property, but the protection of
humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code.</span> Its sanctions are
not
directed to securing the strong in heaping up wealth as much as to
preventing the weak from being crowded to the wall. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">At every point
it
interposes its barriers to the selfish greed that, if left unchecked,
will surely differentiate men into landlord and serf, capitalist and
working person, millionaire and tramp, ruler and ruled. </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Its Sabbath
day and Sabbath year secure, even to the lowliest, rest and leisure. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>With the blast of the Jubilee trumpets the slave goes
free, the debt
that cannot be paid is cancelled, and a re-division of the land
secures again to the poorest their fair share in the bounty of the
common Creator. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The reaper must leave something for the gleaner; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>even
the ox cannot be muzzled as he treadeth out the corn. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Everywhere, in
everything, the dominant idea is that of our homely phrase: "Live and
let live!"... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Its lessons have never tended to the essential selfishness of
asceticism, which is so prominent a feature in Brahmanism and
Buddhism, and from which Christianity and Islamism have not been
exempt. Its injunction has never been "Leave the world to itself that
you may save your own soul" but rather: "Do your duty in the world
that you may be happier and the world be better." It has disdained no
sanitary regulation that might secure the health of the body. Its
promise has been of peace and plenty and length of days, of stalwart
sons and comely daughters.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In the full blaze of the
nineteenth century, when every child in
our schools may know as common truths things of which the Egyptian
sages never dreamed; when the earth has been mapped and the stars
have been weighed; when steam and electricity have been pressed into
our service, and science is wresting from nature secret after secret
&#8211; it is but natural to look back upon the wisdom of three
thousand years ago as an adult looks back upon the learning of a
child. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And yet, for all this wonderful
increase of knowledge, for all
this enormous gain of productive power, where is the country in the
civilised world in which today there is not want and suffering &#8211;
where the masses are not condemned to toil that gives no leisure, and
all classes are not pursued by a greed of gain that makes life an
ignoble struggle to get and to keep? Three thousands years of
advances, and still the moan goes up: "They have made our lives
bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner
of service!" Three thousand years of advances! and the piteous voices
of little children are in the moan.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Over ocean wastes far wider than
the Syrian desert we have sought
our promised land &#8211; no narrow strip between the mountains and
the sea, but a wide and virgin continent. Here, in greater freedom,
with vaster knowledge and fuller experience, we are building up a
nation that leads the van of modern progress. And yet while we prate
of the rights of humanity there are already many among us thousands
who find it difficult to assert the first of natural rights &#8211;
the right to earn an honest living; thousands who from time to time
must accept of degrading charity or starve. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We boast of equality before the
law; yet notoriously justice is
deaf to the call of those who have no gold and blind to the sin of
those who have. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We pride ourselves upon our
common schools; yet after our boys
and girls are educated we vainly ask: "What shall we do with them?"
And about our colleges children are growing up in vice and crime,
because from their homes poverty has driven all refining influences.
We pin our faith to universal suffrage; yet with all power in the
hands of the people, the control of public affairs is passing into
the hands of a class of professional politicians, and our governments
are, in many cases, becoming but a means for robbery of the people.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We have prohibited hereditary
distinctions, we have forbidden
titles of nobility; yet there is growing up an aristocracy of wealth
as powerful and merciless as any that ever held sway. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We progress and we progress; we
girdle continents with iron roads
and knit cities together with the mesh of telegraph wires; each day
brings some new invention, each year marks a fresh advance &#8211; the
power of production increased, and the avenues of exchange cleared
and broadened. Yet the complaint of "hard times" is louder and
louder; everywhere are people harassed by care, and haunted by the
fear of want. With swift, steady strides and prodigious leaps, the
power of human hands to satisfy human wants advances and advances, is
multiplied and multiplied. Yet the struggle for mere existence is
more and more intense, and human labour is becoming the cheapest of
commodities. Beside glutted warehouses human beings grow faint with
hunger and shiver with cold; under the shadow of churches festers the
vice that is born of want. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Trace to its roots the cause that
is producing want in the midst
of plenty, ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in
democracy, weakness in strength &#8211; that is giving to our
civilisation a one-sided and unstable development &#8211; and you will
find it something which this Hebrew statesman three thousand years
ago perceived and guarded against. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Moses
saw that the real cause of the enslavement of the masses of
Egypt was &#8211; what has everywhere produced enslavement &#8211; the
possession by a class of land upon which and from which the whole
people must live.</span> He saw that to permit in land the same
unqualified
private ownership that by natural right attaches to the things
produced by labour, would be inevitably to separate the people into
the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave labour &#8211;
to make the few the masters of the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation no matter what the religion.&nbsp;
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The life of Moses, like
the institutions of Moses, is a protest against that blasphemous
doctrine current now as it was three thousand years ago, preached oft
times even from Christian pulpits &#8211; that the want and suffering
of the masses of humankind flow from a mysterious dispensation of
providence, which we may lament, but can neither quarrel with nor
alter. Let those who hug that doctrine themselves, those to whom it
seems that the squalor and brutishness with which the very centres of
our civilisation abound are not their affair, turn to the example of
that life. For to them who will look, yet burns the bush; and to them
who will hear, again comes the voice: "The people suffer: who will
lead them forth?" </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Adopted into the immediate family
of the supreme monarch and
earthly god; standing almost at the apex of the social pyramid which

that life could offer to gratify the senses or engage the intellect
was open to him. </small></p>

   <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
       of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
       Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
   <blockquote>
     <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
       of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
       meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But
       reading it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
       property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
       property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for
       private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation.
       You urge:</p>
     <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
       paragraph 5) ...<br>
       2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
       (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
       3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
       paragraph 8.) ...<br>
       4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
       (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
       5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
       of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
       sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
       6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
       in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.)
       ...<br>
       7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
       and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.)
       ...<br>
       8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
       not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take
       the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the
       private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
       of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
       sanctioned by Divine Law. (11.)</p>
     <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
       property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
       practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
     <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace
       them the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality
       of right to land, and that when individual possession became necessary
       to secure the right of ownership in things produced by labor some method
       of securing equality, sufficient in the existing state of social development,
       was adopted. Thus, among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically
       divided, land used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among
       others, every family was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling
       and for cultivation, but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped
       any one else could step in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature
       were the land laws of the Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided
       among the people, was made inalienable by the provision of the jubilee,
       under which, if sold, it reverted every fiftieth year to the children
       of its original possessors.</p>
     <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the
       same right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor,
       has never grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery,
       it is the result of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your
       ancestors, the Romans, whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire
       it destroyed.</p>
     <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination
       of the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for
       equality, there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common
       rights in land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some
       obligation. The sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was
       the only owner of land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants,
       whose possession involved duties or payments, which, though rudely and
       imperfectly, embodied the idea that we would carry out in the single tax,
       of taking land values for public uses. The crown lands maintained the
       sovereign and the civil list; the church lands defrayed the cost of public
       worship and instruction, of the relief of the sick, the destitute and
       the wayworn; while the military tenures provided for public defense and
       bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion of the land remained
       in common, the people of the neighborhood being free to pasture it, cut
       wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
     <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land
       is to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were
       rude, wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time
       unthought of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding
       poverty which despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England,
       the highest authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers,
       declares that in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so
       helpless, so pressed and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our
       boasted nineteenth century; and that, save in times of actual famine,
       there was no laborer so poor as to fear that his wife and children might
       come to want even were he taken from them. Dark and rude in many respects
       as they were, these were the times when the cathedrals and churches and
       religious houses whose ruins yet excite our admiration were built; the
       times when England had no national debt, no poor law, no standing army,
       no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands of human beings rising
       in the morning without knowing where they might lay their heads at night.</p>
     <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in
       land that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly
       be said that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites;
       that the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII.,
       and in Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally
       remitted in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted;
       and that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own
       time all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater
       landowners; while the same private ownership of land was extended over
       Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by
       bribery of the chiefs. Even the military dues, had they been commuted,
       not remitted, would today have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses
       without one penny of other taxation.</p>
     <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it
       is only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts
       is due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the
       large plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence
       of slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
       English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
       manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret
       of the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that
       land was to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established
       in English thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so
       treated by the United States and by the several States. And though land
       was at first sold cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also
       sold in large quantities to speculators, given away in great tracts for
       railroads and other purposes, until now the public domain of the United
       States, which a generation ago seemed illimitable, has practically gone.
       And this, as the experience of other countries shows, is the natural result
       in a growing community of making land private property. When the possession
       of land means the gain of unearned wealth, the strong and unscrupulous
       will secure it. But when, as we propose, economic rent, the &#8220;unearned
       increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by the state for the use of the community,
       then land will pass into the hands of users and remain there, since no
       matter how great its value, its possession will be profitable only to
       users.</p>
     <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
       of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious
       fact that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and
       of lawsuits, while it is the poverty engendered by private property in
       land that makes the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes
       of what we call Christian civilization.</p>
     <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the
       private ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt
       not covet thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor
       his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything
       which is his.&#8221;</p>
     <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor
       his field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land
       as it exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
       man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel
       slavery; for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that
       these terms referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual
       slaves. But the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and
       improvement, to which the right of possession and ownership does attach
       without recognition of property in the land itself.<strong> And that this
       reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is not a sanction of private property in land
       as it exists today is proved by the fact that the Mosaic code expressly
       denied such unqualified ownership in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the
       land also shall not be sold forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers
       and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided for its reversion every fiftieth
       year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive industrial conditions of
       the time, securing to all of the chosen people a foothold in the soil.</strong></p>
     <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
       be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that
       justly attaches to the things produced by labor.<strong> Everywhere is
       it treated as the free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth
       thee.&#8221; </strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

   <p>    Robert Andelson and James Dawsey: <a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
        Wasteland to Promised Land</a> (synopsis) </p>
      </blockquote>
 <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the book of Joshua, we find that although the
  Promised Land is a gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even
  before the actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed
  a method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's sight.
  The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with human sacrifice
  and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive, monopolistic social order.
  By contrast, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel, to make good its claim, had to institute
  a social order that would guard against the desecration, pollution, and injustices
  of which its predecessors were guilty, and would secure to each family and
  to every generation within the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use
  of the land, of
which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner.</span><br>
<br>
They began with a census of the tribes and families before the conquest (Num.
26:1-51). Every tribe, excepting Levi, and within each tribe every family, was
to receive its proportionate share, according to size (Num. 26:55-56), and ultimately,
to ensure fairness, by lot (Num. 34:16-29). The actual distribution, according
to these provisions, was
concluded at Shiloh (Josh. 19:51). <span style="font-weight: bold;">According
to ancient historian Josephus, the territory was not divided into shares of equal
size but of equal agricultural value. The landmarks that protected these allotments
were protected by the public and solemn denunciation of a curse against anyone
who should dishonestly tamper
with them</span> (Deut. 27:11-16; 19:14).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As discovered again in our own century, it is
easier to devise a one-time fair apportionment of land that it is to keep the
system from falling apart. This is why the ancient law established the Jubilee
year. At the end of every fifty years, any alienated lands -- given away, sold,
or lost from unpaid
debts -- would be restored to the original families.</span> Temporary possessors
were to be compensated for any unexhausted improvements they may have made on
the land. Concentrated landownership, and the division of society into landed
and landless classes, was thereby prevented from
creeping into the system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Jubilee
effectively took the profit out of landholding as such, leaving no incentive
for speculation. When it was observed -- and historical records indicate that
it was observed for long periods -- the Jubilee system successfully removed the
root cause of poverty from the Jewish
society.</span><br>
<br>
The influence of the Jubilee idea upon <span style="font-weight: bold;">early
Pennsylvania colonists</span> is evidenced by the inscription on the Liberty
Bell of the biblical words enjoining the Jubilee year: "Proclaim Liberty throughout
all the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof." (Lev. 25:10) The founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn, advocated that
all men be "tenants to the public", and to defray public expenses instituted
a tax on land.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmental concern also goes back to biblical
land laws. </span>To prevent the exhaustion of the soil, a periodic fallow was
ordered. "During one year in every seven, the soil, left to the influences of
sun and frost, wind and rain, was to be allowed to 're-create' itself after six
years' cropping, exactly as the tiller of the soil renewed his strength, after
six days' work, by his
Sabbath day's rest."<br>
<br>
As noted, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the tribe of Levi did not share in
the equal division of the land, since it was charged with carrying out religious
and public duties</span>. Its members were entitled to an indemnity from the
eleven tribes who received the land
that otherwise would have gone to them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This indemnity was the tithe -- one-tenth of the
product from the land occupied by the eleven other tribes.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, in principle, is the formula for a just
land system in almost any time or place. The compensation to the Levites maintained
the substance of equal rights to land, alongside of and compatible with unequal
physical division of the land itself.</span> As Frederick Verinder pointed out
in his book <span
 style="font-style: italic;">My Neighbour's Landmark</span>, joint heirs of a
house may share it equally by occupying it equally or
unequally but "paying the rental into a common fund, from which each draws an
equal share; or they may let the whole house to someone else and divide the rent
equally."<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> So it is with land.
Sharing equally in the economic rent or value of land through the application
of that value to common uses from which all benefit, renders private ownership
and unequal partition of land morally and
pragmatically benign.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The modern equivalent of removing one's neighbor's
landmark is thus not the private ownership of land per se, but rather the private
appropriation of land value.</span> "The
profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic, to assure
everyone the same natural opportunity, asserts that all people have an equal
right to economic rent, and the Levite tithe demonstrates that the socialization
of rent offsets the ethical and practical harm resulting from private land ownership.
But there is
another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent should
be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises in large measure
from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of population, and community activity
in a particular area. </span>More people means more demand for space on which
to live and work. Community activities such as roads, schools, protection, parks,
sewage, utilities and other public services, as well as the totality of private
commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive or desirable.
It follows that a community which funds such improvements out of its rent fund
will be provided with a stable and growing fund with which to maintain and improve
them. And unlike conventional taxes, the collection of this fund will enhance,
not penalize, the production
of wealth.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare capacity as landowners,
do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from use, whether for
speculation or for other reasons, they may generate scarcity, artificially inflating
rent, but this does not reflect any positive contribution to production on the
part of landowners.</span> ... <a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">read the whole synopsis</a><br>

 <p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
     the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
     argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity,
     and are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained
     them from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
     resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
     N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth
     of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God
     wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his
     own fig tree.</p>
   <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
     land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
     of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
     Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
     use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
     years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
     owner.</p>
   <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
     of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
     expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
     owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
     a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
     am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
     in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
   <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
     of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on
     it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
     sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
     share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal
     to his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is
     meant land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the
     country.</p>
   <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
     as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
     more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
     to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
     the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
   <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
     at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
     feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
     of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
     of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
     enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
     land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course,
     they may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the
     situation from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot
     of ground from which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back,
     and any deviation from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed
     to by the parties directly involved, who judge themselves to be better off
     as the result of the exchanges.</p>
   <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
     conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
     land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
     or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
     uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
     (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
     of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
     means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the
     people. Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
     term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
     landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
     for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
     other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
     the land that is being seized.</p>
   <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
     support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
     Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
     Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
     F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
     Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
     Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
     Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
     of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
     1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
     James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
     S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
   <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
     cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
     tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
     to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
     and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real
     estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the
     two assessments separately, and a parcel of land in the business district
     of a large city very often has a different owner from the building on it.)
     Many cities have moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements,
     and most have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are
     more likely to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that
     of the public -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve
     their land by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
   <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
     proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental
     and reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results
     of a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
     in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
     the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
     of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
     work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators
     seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole
