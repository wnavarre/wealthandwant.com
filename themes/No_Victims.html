  <p>AND while in the nature of things any change from wrong-doing to right-doing
    must entail loss upon those who profit by the wrong-doing, and this can no
    more be prevented than can parallel lines be made to meet; yet it must also
    be remembered that in the nature of things the loss is merely relative, the
    gain absolute. Whoever will examine the subject will see that in the abandonment
    of the present unnatural and unjust method of raising public revenues and
    the adoption of the natural and just method even those who relatively lose
    will be enormous gainers. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would be hard to
find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while the
general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the capitalist. So
true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to put
all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely reduce all great
fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest landowner
in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation would largely reduce his
enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income from
them, and doubtless much personal property in various other shapes. He would
still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

THE existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
society at large suffers and of which the very rich and the very poor are alike
victims, though at the opposite extremes. <br>
            <br>
Seeing this, it seems to us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of
the rich as though they individually were responsible for the sufferings of the
poor. Yet, while you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and
degrading poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and
dangerous excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove
it. Another insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds
up the poor victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right- ? &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

<p>a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
    Wasteland to Promised land:
  Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The Promised
Land and the Kingdom of God</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Promised Land, like Eden,
is a
place of unhindered scope in which to glorify God and manifest his
will. But it is not the Kingdom of God. It represents liberation from
external bondage -- from oppression and restricted access to material
opportunity.</span> It is the temporal matrix within which the Kingdom
may find full expression. But it is not itself the Kingdom. Although it
is a heresy that locates this Kingdom exclusively in the afterlife or
an ethereal paradise, Jesus declared it to be "not of this world" (John
18:36) but "within" (Luke 17:21). It is no reproach to Henry George
that he lost sight of this distinction between the Promised Land and
the Kingdom of God, enraptured by his vision of a just society:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">With
want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of jealousy and
fear that now array men against each other; with mental power loosed by
conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure; and who shall
measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? Words fail the
thought! It is the Golden Age.... It is the culmination of Christianity
-- the City of God on earth, with walls of jasper and gates of pearl!
It is the reign of the Prince of Peace!</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">By equalizing opportunity,
political
and economic liberation tend to draw both poor and rich into the middle
class. As an expression of social justice, this constitutes a genuine
advance, ethical as well as material. But it is no easy guarantee of
spiritual gain.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">conscientization</span>"
(roughly, consciousness-raising through social commitment), emphasized
and refined by liberation theology, must continue although in a
different vein. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Kingdom of God
will flourish only when outward liberation gives rise to inward
liberation</span>, a victory over the limitations of the bourgeois
ethos.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The Earth Is the Lord's"
(Psalm
24:1). This statement tells us something about God. </span>He is
attached to the land and loves it. He is not a spiritual abstraction
oblivious to the Wasteland in which we live. God is the maker of the
world of eating and sleeping, working and begetting. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It also tells us something of our place in
this world.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">With God as the
true owner of the earth, every person has a right to the produce which
equitable usufruct yields to his or her efforts.</span></small><br>
<br>
Middle-class traits include virtues such as
industry, thrift, restraint, commercial and professional rectitude,
but, on the other hand, low prudentialism, self-satisfaction, and an
inclination to regard material well-being as a sign of righteousness.
Hence, even in the Promised Land, what Paulo Freire calls "
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the same God
who established communities has also in his providence ordained for
them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue. Yet, in the
Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into the pockets
of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by extorting
individuals the fruits of their honest toil. </span><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If ever there were any doubt that
structural sin exists, our present system of taxation is the proof.
Everywhere we see governments penalizing individuals for their industry
and creativity, while the socially produced value of land is reaped by
speculators in exact proportion to the land which they withhold. The
greater the Wasteland, the greater the reward. Does this comport with
any divine plan, or notion of justice and human rights? Or does it not,
rather, perpetuate the Wasteland and prevent the realization of the
Promised Land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
have a
corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh
universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more sinful
than are people at large, except to the degree that they knowingly
obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation. Many
abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system, it is
better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
does. The
profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially desirable as
well as in ways that are socially destructive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let us give testimony to our faith that the
earth is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no
victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let me make this clear:
Acquisitiveness, or the "profit motive,"
if you will, is a well-nigh universal fact of human nature, and I
have no wish to suggest that the land monopolist or speculator has
any corner on it. Even when I speak of him as a parasite, this is not
to single him out for personal moral condemnation. He is not
necessarily any more greedy than the average run of people. As my
late friend, Sidney G. Evans, used to say: "if you have to live under
a corrupt system, it's better to be a beneficiary than a victim of
it." But the profit motive can be channeled in ways which are
socially desirable as well as in ways which are socially destructive.
Is it not our duty to do everything we can to build an order without
victims one in which the profit motive is put to use in such a way
that everybody benefits?</small>  <a href="../docs/Andelson_TEITL.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read
