<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The Land for the
    People</a> (1889 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Now, rent is a natural and just thing. For instance, if we in this
      room were to go together to a new country and we were to agree that we
      should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we divide the
      land up in such a way as to insure and to continue equality? If it were
      proposed that we should divide it up into equal pieces, there would be
      in the first place this objection, that in our division we would not fully
      know the character of the land; one man would get a more valuable piece
      than the other. Then as time passed the value of different pieces of land
      would change, and further than that if we were once to make a division
      and then allow full and absolute ownership of the land, inequality would
      come up in the succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another
      man, on the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one
      man would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In
      a little while many of these people would have parted with their land to
      others, so that their children coming after them into the world would have
      no land. The only fair way would be this-- that any man among us should
      be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use it, that no one else
      wanted to use; that where more than one man wanted to use the same piece
      of land, the man who did use it should pay a premium which, going into
      a common fund and being used for the benefit of all, would put everybody
      upon a plane of equality. That would be the ideal way of dividing up the
      land of a new country.</small> </p>
  <p><small>THE problem is how to apply that to an old country. True we are confronted
      with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain class have got
      possession of the land, and want to hold it. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Now one of your distinguished leaders, Mr.
      Parnell in his Drogheda speech some years ago, said <span style="font-weight: bold;">there
      were only two ways of getting the land for the people. One way was to buy
      it; the other was to fight for it. </span>I do not think that is true.
      I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at that time a most important </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">third way</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">, and that is the way we advocate.</span></small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what we call
      the single tax. We propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of
      all the taxes that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a

      not upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the exercise
      of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the individual;
      but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of the improvements,
      so that an acre of land that has not been improved will pay as much tax
      as an acre of like land that has been improved. So that in a town a house
      site on which there is no building shall be called upon to pay just as
      much tax as a house site on which there is a house.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Karl Williams:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Williams_ImK.html">Social
Justice In Australia: INTERMEDIATE KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Certainly there have been
endless attempts at land reform. "<span style="font-style: italic;">Viva
la revoluci&oacute;n!</span>"
has been the cry all through Latin America, for instance, but the lot
of the average peasant has changed little, even with the best will in
the world behind land reform.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here's the problem. So-called land reform has always been seen
as land
redistribution, based on the same form of outright land ownership. But
there are three cogent reasons why land redistribution, as remarked
above, does not work and never will.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firstly, to redistribute
land means to divide it up. But land is so vastly different as to make
this task utterly impractical,</span>
what with wilderness, marginal agricultural land, good agricultural
land, outer suburban land and prime real estate in the heart of the
cities. Where's Solomon to wisely divide it all up, with the added
problem of buildings and improvements that some people have built and
others haven't? Would A have to get 100 square kilometres of desert to
match B's parcel of two square metres opposite the GPO?</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondly, even if the
different
values were measured at a given moment, they would immediately begin to
change, and would continue to do so.</span> Even if everyone might
start with a parcel of land equal in value to everyone else's, those
values would at once begin to shift. In the first year a dam is built
here, a school is closed down there, and roads are built everywhere.
Appreciation and depreciation would continue year after year, and in no
time everyone's "equal" parcels would have ceased to be such. A great
way to operate a casino, but what sort of way to run a society?</small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Thirdly, even if you could wave
a
magic wand and somehow take into account the different and
ever-changing values of land, what about new entrants like the newborn
of the next and future generations? And what do immigrants get?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the Big Three reasons
above, there are two minor ones worth mentioning.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>After the land "reform," would
selling, speculating and profiteering go on as before, or would all
have to stick to their allocated plots for the rest of their lives?</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It would require a really
squeaky-clean government for the "casino" of changing land values not
to turn into a den of political influence and corruption.</span> Most
likely, development would be skewed towards the land of the politically
empowered. Or maybe the kleptocracy would get the tip-off to buy land
where development is going to take place.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">REAL
REFORM, NOT REVOLUTION</span></small><br>
<small>None of the problems above would exist with LVT, the
implementation of
which would be far less revolutionary than that of historical land
reforms. We need land reform here in Australia, of course - but in the
Third World where poverty is so great, matters are urgent. What good
has foreign aid done over all these years, when you look at the
disparities of wealth in recipient countries? Why do governments even
today (as in Zimbabwe) still go down the path of land reform whereby
land is doled out to a handful of government supporters?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We all know the proverb: Give a man a fish and he'll be fed for
a day,
but teach a man to fish and he'll feed himself for a lifetime. One
would assume that Western governments, the World Bank and the IMF also
knew it, but they continue to hand out fish instead. ... <span

of Production</a><span

 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The initial distribution of land
- the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land. What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles(e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, radio, landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money. Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.&nbsp;<big> </big></small><small><a

 Land Question</a> (1881)<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"><br>
</a>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A little Island or a little World</span><br>
    IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming
    in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Let them divide
    the land, share and share alike, as individual property.</span> At
    first,
    while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
    primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
  <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and
    look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
    multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
    even supposing there have been no important inventions or
    improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
    causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
    During this time some of these people will have been careless,
    generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
    of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
    they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
    inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
    their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
    pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
    trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
    fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
    things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
    happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
    again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
    possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
    treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
    equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
    than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
    many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
    our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
    no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
    taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
    imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
    utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
    produced poverty and virtual slavery.</p>
  <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to
    say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
    live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
    make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
    to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
    have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
    land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
    rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
    absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
    only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
    land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
    his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
    everything as he wills.</p>
  <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so
    far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
    land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
    competition between them as well as between those who have only their
    labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
    will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
    Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
    produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
    factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
    factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
    as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
    these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
    very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
    his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
    labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
    it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
    laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
    making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
    over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
    pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
    urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
    the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
    are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
    larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
    produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
    steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
    of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
    effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
    constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
    give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
    same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
    work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
    little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
    of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
    the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
    would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
  <p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
    suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
    steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
    reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
    are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
  <p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is
    to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
    same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
    amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
    the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
    something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
    to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
    invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
    this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
    being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
    proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
    the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
    inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
    dependent.</p>
  <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving
    inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
    perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
    away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
    to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
    else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
    continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
    the landowners!
