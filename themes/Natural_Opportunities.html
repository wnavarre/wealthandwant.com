    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
    is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This
    is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land,
    are in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community,
        then will the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have
        an advantage
      over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
      get its full reward, and capital its natural return. </strong>... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p><strong>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men,
        and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely offers
      to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice </strong>&#8212; for,
      so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
      to be
      the supreme law of the universe. <strong>But by sweeping away this injustice
      and asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
      ourselves
      to the law </strong>&#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. </strong>This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
      abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of
    her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have
    not seen
      her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
      rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as
      well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support
      all growth,
      supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and
      inert mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty
      to mankind.
      It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every
      age the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty
      have
      suffered.</p>
  <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
      national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
  <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
      among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
  <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. <strong>It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
      Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! </strong>Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. </strong>This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p><strong>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. </strong>It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe
        forbid it.</strong> Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that
        is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something grander
        than Benevolence, something more
      august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
        to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
        come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays
        on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. </strong>We
        degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would
        have better ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such
        an ulcerous
        ant-hill! It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the
        vice and misery that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers
        upon us
        his gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
        food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while
        we tear and rend each other!</p>
  <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
        enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
        nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
        the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into
        being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air;
        fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
        spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold!
        Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit
        would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the
        material universe could be utilized only through land.</p>
  <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
        know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under our
        very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that
        Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which
        maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made, has
        increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
        of nature had been increased. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
          of mankind. </li>
    <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels the
      lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
    <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
    <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
      of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
      the
          same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
        with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings
        while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few
        are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every page may be read
        the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that
        follows
        injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state
        of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After us the deluge!&quot; Nay;
        the pillars of the State are trembling even now, and the very foundations
        of
        society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The
        struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand,
        if it be
        not already begun.</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying
          the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
      gather for the strife!</p>
  <p><strong>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,
        if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear,<em> the
        forces that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation.</em> </strong>Think
        of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored;
        of the possibilities of which the wondrous inventions of this century give
        us but a hint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> With want destroyed;</li>
    <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
    <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
      jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
    <li> with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
    <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Words fail the thought! <strong>It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
        and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which
        has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw
        whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the

    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with <strong>the
    equality of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural
    rights</strong>.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
    of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the <em>only</em> possible remedy.</strong></p>
  <p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations to
    the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say, the immutable
    laws of God are such, that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise
    any way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
    can be removed otherwise than by doing justice, by opening to all the bounty
    that God has provided for all.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it,
    what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
    deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p><strong>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes.
      The existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from
      which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched.</strong> Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights we do not
    seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all.</p>
  <p>Nor do we seek any &#8220;futile and ridiculous equality.&#8221; We recognize,
    with you, that there must always be differences and inequalities. In so far
    as these are in conformity with the moral law, in so far as they do not violate
    the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221; we are content. We do not
    seek to better God&#8217;s work; we seek only to do his will. The equality
    we would bring about is not the equality of fortune, but the equality of
    natural opportunity; the equality that reason and religion alike proclaim &#8212;<strong> the
    equality in usufruct of all his children to the bounty of Our Father who
    art in Heaven. ...</strong></p>
  <p>Hence, short of what wages may be earned when all restrictions on labor
    are removed and access to natural opportunities on equal terms secured to
    all, it is impossible to fix any rate of wages that will be deemed just,
    or any rate of wages that can prevent working-men striving to get more. So
    far from it making working-men more contented to improve their condition
    a little, it is certain to make them more discontented.</p>
  <p>Nor are you asking justice when you ask employers to pay their working-men
    more than they are compelled to pay &#8212; more than they could get others
    to do the work for. You are asking charity. For the surplus that the rich
    employer thus gives is not in reality wages, it is essentially alms. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

  <p>Our little local politics may differ; our greater politics are one and the
      same. We have the same evils to redress, the same truth to propagate, the same
      end to seek.</p>
  <p>And that end, what is it but liberty? (Hear, hear) He who listens to the voice
      of Freedom, she will lead and lead him on. Before I was born, before our friend
      there was born, there was in a southern city of the United States a young printer
      bearing the name William Lloyd Garrison. (Cheers) He saw around him the iniquity
      of negro slavery. (Hear, hear) The voice of the oppressed cried to him and
      would not let him rest, and he took up the cross. He became the great apostle
      of human liberty, and today in American cities that once hooted and stoned
      him there are now statues raised to William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
  <p>He began as a protectionist. As he moved on he saw that liberty meant something
      more than simply the abolition of chattel slavery. He saw that liberty also
      meant, not merely the right to freely labor for oneself, but the right to freely
      exchange one's production, and, from a protectionist, William Lloyd Garrison
      became a free trader. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>And now, when the first is gone, the second comes forward, to take one further
      step to realize that <strong>for perfect freedom there must also be freedom
      in the use of natural opportunities</strong>. (Hear, hear, and cheers)</p>
  <p>We have come . . . to the same point by converging lines. Why is freedom
    of trade good? Simply that trade &#8212; exchange &#8212; is but a mode of production.
      Therefore, to secure full free trade we must also secure freedom to the natural
      opportunities of production. (Hear, hear) Our production&#8212;what is it?
      We produce from what? From land. All human production consists but in working
      up the raw materials that we find in nature &#8212; consists simply in changing
      in place, or in form, that matter which we call land. To free production there
      must be no monopoly of the natural element. Even in our methods we agree primarily
      on this essential point &#8212; that everyone ought to be free to exert
      his labor, to retain or to exchange its fruits, unhampered by restrictions,
      unvexed
      by the tax gatherer. (Hear, hear) . . .</p>
  <p>Chattel slavery, thank God, is abolished at last. Nowhere, where the American
      flag flies, can one man be bought, or sold, or held by another. (Cheers) But
      a great struggle still lies before us now. Chattel slavery is gone; industrial
      slavery remains. The effort, the aim of the abolitionists of this time is to
      abolish industrial slavery. (Cheers) ... <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders" who
have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the full
sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax, they proposed
the only means by which the free trade principle can ever be carried to its logical
conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade but of all other forms and
modes of production, with full freedom of access to the natural element which
is essential to all production. They were the authors of the motto that in the
English use of the phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez aller!" "Clear
the ways and let things alone." This is said to come from the cry that in medieval
tournaments gave the signal for combat, The English motto which I take to come
closest to the spirit of the French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The

HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound, blindfolded, and
gagged. Shall we stand in a knot about him and discuss whether to put a piece
of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on his coat, or shall we dispute
with each other as to what road he ought to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle,
a horse and wagon, or a railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather
postpone such discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for
himself, speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
a torn coat, he may get on his feet, and if he cannot find a conveyance to suit
him, he will at least be free to walk. <br>

            </span>WE talk about the supply of labor, and the demand for labor,
            but, evidently, these are only relative terms. The supply of labor
            is everywhere the same &#8212; two hands always come into the world
            with one mouth, twenty-one boys to every twenty girls; and the demand
            for labor must always exist as long as men want things which labor
            alone can procure. We talk about the "want of work," but, evidently
            it is not work that is short while want continues; evidently, the
            supply of labor cannot be too great, nor the demand for labor too
            small, when people suffer for the lack of things that labor produces.
            The real trouble must be that the supply is somehow prevented from
            satisfying demand, that somewhere there is an obstacle which prevents
            labor from producing the things that laborers want. <br>
            <br>
Take the case of anyone of these vast masses of unemployed men, to whom, though
he never heard of Malthus, it today seems that there are too many people in the
world. In his own wants, in the needs of his anxious wife, in the demands for
his half cared for, perhaps even hungry and shivering, children, there is demand
enough for labor, Heaven knows! In his own willing hands is the supply. Put him
on a solitary island, and though cut off from all the enormous advantages which
the co-operation, combination, and machinery of a civilized community give to
the productive powers of man, yet his two hands can fill the mouths and keep
warm the backs that depend upon them. <strong>Yet where productive power is at
its highest development, he cannot. Why? Is it not because in the one case he
has access
to the material and forces of nature, and in the other this access is denied?</strong> &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html"> Book

  to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those

  <p>  AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
    the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
    the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
    reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
  reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one
  can keep
    to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
    enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
    advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
    the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a
  gain to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
    supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
    it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
    rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
    else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits

      FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q26. Hasn't every man who needs it a right to be employed by the government?</em><br>
A. No. But he has a right to have government secure him in the enjoyment of his
  equal right to the opportunities for employment that nature and social growth
  supply. When government secures him in that respect, if he cannot get work
  it is because (1) he does not offer the kind of service that people want; or
  (2) he is incapable. His remedy, if he does not offer the kind of service that
  people want, is either to make people see that they are mistaken, or go to
  work at something else; if he is incapable, his remedy is to improve himself.
  In no case has he a right to government interference in his behalf, either
  through schemes to make work, or by bounties or tariffs.</p>
  <p><em>Q30. What effect would the single tax have on immigration? Would it
      cause an influx of foreigners from different nations?</em><br>
    A. If adopted in one country of great natural opportunities, and not in others,
    its tendency would not only be to cause an influx of foreigners, but also
    to make their coming highly desirable. Our own experience in the United States,
    when we had an abundance of free land and were begging the populations of
    the world to come to us, offers a faint suggestion of what might be expected.</p>
  <p><em>Q34. Would the single tax benefit the debtor class? If so, how?</em><br>
A. It would. By abolishing the monopoly of opportunities to work, and thus enabling
  debtors to earn enough, while decently supporting themselves, to honestly pay
  their debts. The debtor class deserves sympathy, not because it is in debt,
  but because it is forced by existing institutions to go into debt in order
  to work, and is then so hampered and harried by the same institutions as to
  make orderly repayment impossible and bankruptcy inevitable. </p>
  <p><em>Q52. Is not the right of ownership of a gold ring the same as the ownership
      of a gold mine? and if the latter is wrong is not the former also wrong?</em><br>
A. If it be wrong for you to own the spring of water which you and your fellows
use, is it therefore wrong for you to own the water that you lift from the spring
to drink? If so how do you propose to slake your thirst? If you argue in reply
that it is not wrong for you to own the spring, then how shall your fellows slake
their thirst when you treat them, as you would have a right to, as trespassers
upon your property? To own the source of labor products is to own the labor of
others; to own what you produce from that source is to own only your own labor.
Nature furnishes gold mines, but men fashion gold rings. The right of ownership
is radically different.... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q30. How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion of the current wealth that
  now flows to privilege. In other words, it would widen and deepen the channel
  of wages by enlarging opportunities for labor, and by increasing the purchasing
  power of nominal wages through reduction of prices. On the other hand it would
  narrow the channel of privilege by making the man who has a privilege pay for
  it.</p>
  <p><em>Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
  A. By the taxation of privilege.</p>
  <p><em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
  A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.</p>
  <p><em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
  A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages undiminished by taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q58. What expected result of the single tax needs studious emphasis?</em><br>
A. That it would unlock the land to labor at its present value for use, instead
  of locking out labor from the land by a prohibitive price based upon the future

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much more credible is a
statement of the form, "<b>We will share
equally the value of natural opportunities that might be

provide a framework in which the value of natural opportunities will
be shared equally, both as an expression of the idea that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities, and as a formula whose
potential to remove the motive for future aggression is greater than
that of enshrining the status quo of any particular year. And in
addition, land value taxation is one way of achieving allocative
efficiency with respect to a wide variety of public issues. </small><small><b>...

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">The
Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The
Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of the factors that makes
the case for secession difficult is
the problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the
people who called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria
in the 1960s, the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact
that, if they had succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate
oil resources from the rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the
efforts of the Chechins to separate from Russia is explained in part
by the understanding that, even though the Chechins have been abused
by Russians for centuries and have never fully acceded to their
incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya were allowed to separate from
Russia, that would create a precedent that would make it difficult to
oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely populated Yakutsia
region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds, to insist that
they too have a right to be a separate nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps, a general recognition of
a right of secession will need
to wait for another component of moral evolution: a recognition that
all persons have equal claims on the value of natural opportunities.
If this were recognized, then any nation or region with
disproportionately great natural resources would be seen to have an
obligation to share the value from using those resources with those
parts of the world that have less than average resources per capita.
This would eliminate the desire to appropriate natural resources as a
reason for secession and as a reason for opposing secession. Signs of
a recognition of the equal claims of all persons on the use of
natural opportunities are slim. One can point to John Locke: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>Whether we consider natural Reason, which tells
us, the Men, being once born, have a right to their Preservation, and
consequently to Meat and Drink, and such other things, as Nature
affords for their Subsistence: Or Revelation, which gives us an account
of those Grants God made of the World to Adam, and to Noah, and his
Sons, 'tis very clear, that God, as King David says, Psal. CXV. xvi.
has given the Earth to the Children of Men, given it to Mankind in
common.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke goes on to say that every
person has a right to himself, and
therefore to the things of value that are created by combining his
efforts with natural opportunities, "at least where there is as much
and as good left in common for others." He then argues that with so
much unclaimed land in America, no one can justly complain if all of
Europe is privately appropriated. Locke does not address the question
of how rights to land should be handled if there is no unclaimed
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thomas Jefferson, writing on the
subject of patents, said, But
while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of
property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit
a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by
those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual
has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for
instance.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George said,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The equal right of all
men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the
air--it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence. For we
cannot suppose that some men have the right to be in this world and
others no right. </small>
  <p><small>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator,
we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty--with an equal right to the use of all that nature so
impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable;
it is a right which vests in every human being as he enters the world,
and which during his continuance in the world can be limited only by
the equal rights of others.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>4</i></b></small></font></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>General recognition of the equal
rights of all to the use of land
and other natural opportunities is hard to find. When the powerful
nations of the world got together to eject Iraq from Kuwait, very
little was heard of the bizarreness of supposing that Emir of Kuwait
and his relatives had a right to all the oil that lay under Kuwait.
Some recognition of equal rights to the use of natural opportunities
can be found in the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty, which would have
had all nations benefiting from the granting of franchises to extract
minerals from the sea. From an economic perspective, the treaty was
flawed by the fact that it would have created an artificial scarcity
of seabed mining activities in order to raise revenue, and it was
opposed by the U.S. and not implemented. But it did suggest general
recognition of global equal rights to at least those natural
opportunities that no one has yet begun to use.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One impediment to the recognition
of equal rights to the use of
natural opportunities is that some system of assessment would be
needed to identify the transfers that would compensate for unequal
access to natural opportunities. Another impediment is that a system
of rewards for those who discover new opportunities would be needed.
But if there were a will to address them, these technical
difficulties could be solved adequately, as they are in jurisdictions
such as Alberta, Canada, that claim all mineral rights for the
government. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">Read

Case for Taxing Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1)
every person has a right to himself or herself, and <br>
2) all persons have
equal rights to the natural opportunities that are not embodied in
persons. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The first premise leads to the
conclusion that taxing
people according to the products of their efforts or the products of
their saving can only be just if people voluntarily agree,
individually, to be subject to such taxes.&nbsp; Taxing land, on the
other hand, does not involve such an intrusion on individual
rights.&nbsp; In fact, taxing land is a way equalizing the advantages
of access to land, as required by the second premise.</small><small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.<br>
<br>
After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
<br>
Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
<br>
Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong><br>
.<br>
Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
<br>
But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss what land
is.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Ethical Case for Taxing Land<br>
</span>The ethical case for taxing land is based on two premises.&nbsp;
The
first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
controversial since the end of slavery, so I will simply assume that
this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed.<br>
<br>
Natural opportunities include not only land, but also water, fish in
oceans and rivers, the frequency spectrum, minerals, virgin forests,
and geosynchronous orbits.&nbsp; Some natural opportunities, such as
the opportunity to use the oceans for transport, are most valuable to
people when all are allowed to use them as they wish.&nbsp; (This does
not imply that their value is greatest when all can pollute as they
wish.)&nbsp; Other natural opportunities, such as most plots of land,
are most valuable when one person has exclusive use of them.<br>
<br>
The processes that humans employ to determine who shall have exclusive
use of natural opportunities are complex.&nbsp; To some extent,
opportunities are assigned to those who first make use of them.&nbsp;
However, another important component of the
natural-opportunity-assignment process is the ability and willingness
to use deadly force to exclude others.&nbsp; Americans from Europe
undertook some negotiations with the native American Indians, but
primarily they threatened to kill the Indians if they did not agree to
move into smaller territories.&nbsp; All over the world, nations
emerged when war-minded leaders imposed their rule where they
could.&nbsp; We have built a relatively humane world on this violent
foundation, but the origins of the assignment of natural opportunities
cannot be characterized as just.<br>
<br>
Nor would have been just (or efficient) to adhere to a rule of initial
assignment based on first use.&nbsp; It would not be just because a
person who arrives later than another is not inherently less
deserving.&nbsp; (It would not be efficient because a rule of
assignment based on first use promotes inefficient, excessive
investment in being first.&nbsp; Still, to motivate efficient
discov&shy;ery, it pays to provide some reward for discoverers.) <br>
<br>
Justice requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all persons to
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; At the level of relations among nations,
this requires every nation to determine whether it is using more than
its share of natural opportunities, and if it is using more than its
share, to compensate other nations that therefore have less than their
shares. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An additional ethical reason for
recognizing equal rights to natural
opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;
Nations have arisen through violence.&nbsp; While the world condemns
violence among nations, it has persistently acquiesced to regimes
established by violence.&nbsp; The greater the natural resources of a
nation, the greater is the attraction to potential tyrants of the
possibility of taking over the nation.&nbsp; If the world is able to
establish an understanding, backed up by the threat of economic
boycotts, that nations have an obligation to share the value of natural
opportunities in proportion to population, and that people are free to
leave nations that they find unacceptable, then the return to violent
appropriation of power will be removed.&nbsp; As long as we accept the
continued exercise of disproportionate power over natural opportunities
by those who acquired that power through violence, we will have
difficulty persuading potential usurpers of power that we will not
accept their conquests.

 href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace,
Justice
and Economic Reform</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the
classical liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his statement
that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One tradition in classical
liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
as exemplified by Murray
Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any
excess in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental problems
with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
rectified.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
another lecture.)</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice is thus a regime in
which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities. </small><small>...</small> <small><small>&nbsp; <big><a

Capitalism and Geoism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But
the term "socialism" does mean
something, and it is often
identified with the quest for economic justice. The basic assumption
underlying it is that the market place, under conditions of pure
laissez-faire competition, is incapable of securing to society an
equitable distribution of wealth.</span> Socialists assert that if the
market
is left alone to decide who is to get how much of the world's goods,
the result is a division of society into classes and the emergence of a
struggle between the exploiting class and the enslaved working class.
Competition becomes &#8220;cutthroat competition,&#8221; fostering trusts, cartels
and monopolies. Instead of making earnings proportional to service
rendered, the market place gives the highest rewards to the most
unscrupulous exploiters.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">However, many are proud to
rally
behind the banner of &#8220;capitalism.&#8221;They contend that free competition makes the fullest possible use of
the gifts of nature and human ingenuity. When the admirable equilibrium
of the market is upset by do-gooders trying to secure their idea of
fairness, the result is unemployment, stagnation and corruption.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capitalists and socialists may
appear
to disagree about everything --
but on one crucial point of political economy their views are uncannily
similar.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both tend to
lump land and capital under the single heading of
&#8220;capital,&#8221; and many even include money as capital. </span>This
confusion
prevents socialists from seeing the possibility of a beneficial free
market without the element of monopoly. And it prevents capitalists
from seeing the fundamental role of the public sector in a just and
prosperous market economy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It may seem odd that both "capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
(Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
universal standard of justice
upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer lies in clarifying
the
question of the rightful basis (if
there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Henry George, however, the
principle was clear. The value of
natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
the
community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
go to the
community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character of
natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
life</small>

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city
    very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have
    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely
    to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the public
    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land
    by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom
    resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  Ethical Land Tenure</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I want to tell you the story of
Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the Judaic tradition, and the Talmudic tradition, how much of
the
Jubilee justice was actually implemented is a subject of discussion.
Some say it was a good idea but not put in place. Others say it was
substantially put into place.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists
because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. For better soil, richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The other thing was some lands were closer to the market. Some
land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market. How do you have an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In this, then, we see affirmed
the doctrine that natural advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain.</span>
Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge</small>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of maximum individual liberty
        does not address the question of how the rights to natural opportunities
        (land, water, ocean fish, minerals, the frequency spectrum, etc.) should
        be
  assigned.</span> There are at least three approaches within the classical liberal
  tradition as to how these returns should be divided.</p>
  <p>George Reisman advocates what might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conservative classical liberalism</span>." This position
      is that certainty in property rights is so valuable that one should never
      ask whether unjustifiable violence was used in establishing the existing
    pattern of control over natural opportunities.</p>
  <p>Every natural opportunity belongs to whoever most recently succeeded in
    establishing control over it.</p>
  <p>Murray Rothbard, by contrast, took what might be called the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading
        libertarian</span>" position. This is the position that when we can know
        who first used a natural opportunity, it belongs to that person, or to
        his or her successor in title through gift and exchange. All thefts from
        victims with identifiable successors should be undone. When we cannot identify
        the proper successor of the first user, the a thing belongs to whoever
        is using it now, unless that person stole it, in which case it properly
      belongs to whoever brings the thief to justice.</p>
  <p>The third position, which might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoliberalism</span>" emerges from the work of Henry
      George. This is the position that all persons have equal rights to natural
      opportunities, which rights should be secured by having the public treasury
      collect the rental value of exclusive access to land and other natural opportunities,
    with the revenue used for public purposes and guaranteed incomes.</p>
  <p>Of these three approaches, I find geoliberalism most attractive. It fits
      my sense of justice that all persons should have equal rights to natural
      opportunities. In addition, by providing funding for guaranteed incomes,
      geoliberalism offers a greater prospect for removing more of the distorting
    taxes that finance the welfare state. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
        do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
        must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
        society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must
        ask the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
        when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about
        the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you
        ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And
        I'm simply saying that more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions
        about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars
        in life's market place. But one day we must come to see that an edifice
        which produces beggars needs restructuring. It means that questions must
        be raised. You see, my friends, when you deal with this,</p>
      <p> * you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;<br>
  * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;<br>
  * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay water
