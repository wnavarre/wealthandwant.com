  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
    100% Location</span></div>
  <p>    The 100% location is the point in a town, in the middle of the Central
    Business District, where rents are the highest.&nbsp; It also is used
  to describe certain sites in more rural areas. (The best waterfront
    properties might also be 100% locations, too.)</p>
  <p>I've heard several descriptions of situations where a group of people who
    know a specific town or city well are asked to sit down together with a large-scale
    local
    map, and are first asked to choose the best location in town for business
    purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very
    quickly, they will
    reach a consensus that a particular intersection or site is the 100% location.&nbsp; The
    moderator then points out a nearby site and asks them to value it compared
    to the 100% location.&nbsp; Again, they will discuss it and reach a concensus
    rather quickly.&nbsp; Other key locations in the town or city are handled
    the same way.&nbsp; Then neighboring locations are valued relative to each
    of those sites.&nbsp; Within a few hours, relative land values for the entire
  city can be generated with a fair degree of reliability. </p>
  <p>Such an analysis does not &#8212;  and should not &#8212; take into account
    how the site is currently used.&nbsp; It is simply about how much the site itself
        is worth, as a result of its natural qualities and the presence of taxpayer-provided
        amenities and services and presence of its neighbors. <br>
    <br>
    Do you know the toddler's stacking toy, which has a series of colored disks
    in primary colors? It makes a good analogy for land values in a healthy city,
    with the highest values in the center, and reasonably smooth concentric rings
    around it.
  </p>
  <p>At the 100% location, a business has access to consumers and employees from
    a 360&deg; degree radius. Existing infrastructure, be it the grid of streets
    in a small town or the complex system of highways and public transportation,
    bring people who live on far less expensive land to the sites where wages
    are the highest. But even there, wages may not be as high as they could be,
    were rent not being privatized. Explore the website for more on this.</p>

    A. All products are due wholly to the union of land and labor. Labor is the
    active force, land is the passive material; and without both there can be
    no product at all. But the part of a man's product that he individually earns,
    as distinguished from the part that he obtains by virtue of advantageous
    location, is determined by the law of rent &#8212; by what his location is
    worth. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world -- an
    artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes. For
    the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently

    by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>

<p>Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
    Capacity of Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The question I am
      assigned is whether the taxable capacity of land without buildings is
      up to the job of financing cities, counties, and schools. Will the
      revenue be enough? The answer is "yes."</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;The universal state and local revenue problem today is
      whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
      exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
      California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
      and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
      figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
  one of them.)</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based on
      land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
      driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
      certainly will not drive away the land. However high the tax rate, not
      one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of town. The
      only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is that it
      stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people think that is
  bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I have here data ... worked up in Milwaukee from 1969 data
      indicating that, if land were assessed correctly, the land fraction of
      the real estate tax base would be over twice what the City Assessor
  reported. His fraction was 31%; it should have been 70%.&nbsp; </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>How does one come to so startling a finding? Wisconsin is not a
      backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
      administration. What I did was study sites on the eve of demolition.
      When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace with a new
      building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that the building
      has no residual value. All the value is then in the land. However, in
      Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the building was worth about
      three times as much as the land, just before tear-down. That is a good
  way to measure to what extent land is underassessed.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When the visitor first gapes at its
      skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you poke
      around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the exception.
      Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of it tumbledown,
  commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State Building. Old as it is, it is still
      nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is in a
      so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
      location (57th Street, I would guess). Even so, when the site and the
      building sold in separate transactions a few years ago, the site
      represented 1/3 of the total value. What does that say about the land
      fraction on neighboring parcels, covered only with the remains of
      ordinary old structures? What does that say about the land fraction
  nearer the 100% location?&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a

Capacity of Land </a></p>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature
            of land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic
            base of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee
            owners harder than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
            land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any
            city, so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold.
            They like the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
            surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land
            is what yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
            by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,
            the absentee owners consist of former residents, or their heirs,
            who grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.</b></small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
          balance of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees, money
          that used to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your
          local treasury to pay your local teachers and city workers, and relieve
          your builders and building managers. In this way taxing land actually
          acts to undergird the value of its own base.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font
