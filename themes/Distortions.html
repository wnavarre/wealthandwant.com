<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Q: I want to follow-up on what you had said some months ago about land reform:</p>
  <p>JES: &quot;The main, underlying idea of Henry George is the taxation of
    land <em>and other natural resources</em>. At the time, people thought, &quot;<em>not
    really that too</em>,&quot; but what was underlying his ideas is rent associated
    with things that are inelastically supplied, which are land <em>and natural
    resources</em>.
    <strong>And using natural resource extraction and using land rents as the basis of
    taxation is an argument that I think makes an awful lot of sense because
    it is a non-distortionary source of income and wealth.</strong> <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Q: A former Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation was given a grant
    recently to research the adequacy of land as a tax base. He's a professor
    at the University of California, Riverside, named Mason Gaffney, and he wrote
    a book titled, &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; Are you familiar
    with his work?</p>
  <p>JES: No.</p>
  <p>Q: I'll send you a copy of the book. Basically, he argues that the founders
    of neo-classical economics, which, as you know, is the paradigm taught in
    schools such as the University of Chicago, distorted the science of economics
    to protect vested interests. For example, Rockefeller money was spent to
    hire professors of economics with a view to their discrediting the ideas
    of Henry George. Did that happen?</p>
  <p>JES: My general impression is that most donors that give money to universities
    don't take a very strong view of [who should be on] the faculty. Sometimes
    it ends up on one side, sometimes on the other. It would have been unusual
    [at Chicago], but it could have happened there. What is striking about Chicago
    as a school of economic theory is that it's very conservative. One would
    have thought that Henry George was someone who would have been liked by &quot;Conservatives.&quot;</p>
  <p>Q: In that George wanted to reduce tax on the fruits of one's own labor?</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. <strong>And you want non-distortionary taxes, so I would have
      thought that every &quot;Conservative&quot; would be in Henry George's camp. </strong>Now,
    as far as I know, I'm one of the few people who keeps emphasizing that you
    ought to view Henry George in a broader way, to include natural resources.
    I didn't think that people thought about that a hundred years ago. But if
    they had, and maybe Rockefeller was smart &#8212; he realized that he obviously
    didn't want a tax on natural resources.</p>
  <p>Q: He wouldn't have wanted rents flowing from natural resources to go to
    the people rather than to him.</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, he obviously wouldn't like that perspective. But I don't know
    if that view was at that time recognized, and I just don't know whether he
    actively intervened at Chicago. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

    Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
    </a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The next important step in
understanding Georgist economics is
recognition that each factor of production has its economic price: the
price of labor is wages, the price of capital is interest, and the
price of land is rent. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When any of
these prices are unpaid,
distortions
result in the economic equilibrium and problems become manifest in
other realms of nature and society. </span>In neoclassical economics
compensation for the use of labor and capital continue to be important
in the formulas and calculations employed to explain the economy. But
for neoclassical economics, David Ricardo&#8217;s &#8220;law of rent&#8221; is
essentially ignored and has be come for all practical purposes an
artifact in the history of economics. Rent continues to exist of
course; it is simply uncollected, left in the hands of those who
maintain monopoly control of certain services of nature, adding to
their market value in ways that distort the balance of markets. Failure
to recognize the importance of land rent (sometimes called economic
rent) is for Georgists critical to an understanding of the problems of
contemporary economies and economic analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14 ...</span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Rent
becomes critically important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgists
today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent.</span> Although there are many differences
about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Any failure to pay back that increment to society, or of
government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s
an honest graft, and I&#8217;m an example of how it works. I might sum up the
whole thing by sayin&#8217;: &#8220;I seen my opportunities and I took &#8216;em.&#8221;<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Just let me explain by
examples. My party&#8217;s in power in the city, and it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to undertake

going to lay out a new park in a certain place.</span><span

I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all
the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that
makes its plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody
cared particularly for before.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><small></small>All society needed to do was to collect the
economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>During the late 19th century, the burden of various direct taxes
was
not so large that many common people felt their acute impact. It was,
however, a time of extreme disparities between the poor and the
wealthy, and the single tax was a means by which to redress some of
those disparities. It would also foster the availability of employment
by making labor more attractive relative to land and capital
investment. In a word, people would more likely have to earn their
money. The fruits of land wealth, distributed among people equally in
the form of government services, would go far toward both enhancing
economic opportunity and correcting inequality. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Georgists today adhere to much the same points of view, although
there
are some significant differences. George himself was an ardent free
trader, mainly because he believed that the single tax should supplant
tariffs. After Ricardo, he accepted the idea of comparative advantage
that arose from trade, but only after land (resource) rents were
collected so as to preclude the raping of the natural environments of
countries rich in such resources. He also believed that population
growth was good &#8212; the more the better, and took special pains to refute
Malthus. But one should also recall that he was living at a time when
the expanse of the American continent was still open to any homesteader
who chose to do so. Population growth was not a problem at that time.
These elements of George&#8217;s thought are inconsequential to his
followers today. Yet it is important
to note that Georgists are not socialists; they do not
subscribe to the view that society should own the means of production.
These should remain privately owned by and large (except perhaps as
today&#8217;s economic theory would call for, i.e., natural monopolies,
public goods, and other government instruments). They are, rather,
free-marketers in the full sense of the world, even more ardently than
many contemporary American conservatives<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He believed that
removing the
accretion of economic rent from landsites would restore self-regulating
equilibrium of the marketplace, thus obviating the need for the heavy
hand of government controls. ...</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>A tax that is neutral is one that in no way alters the behavior
of the markets by its imposition; that is people perform and make
choices in the same way as if there was no tax at all.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small>
Because a tax on &#8220;land&#8221; broadly defined is inelastic, i.e., has a fixed
supply, any tax on this base is completely capitalized in the market
price of the land itself. It is, in effect, a tax on the land rent, or
a recapture of the land rent by government in the name of society, just
as the rent is a creation of that society.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>39"The striking result is
that a
tax on rent will lead to no
distortions or economic inefficiencies. Why not?&nbsp; Because a tax on
pure
economic rent does not change anyone's economic behavior. Demanders are
unaffected because their price is unchanged. The behavior of suppliers
is unaffected because the supply of land is fixed and cannot react.
Hence, the economy operates after the tax exactly as it did before the
tax--with no distortions or inefficiencies arising as a result of the
land tax." P. Samuelson and W. D. Nordhaus, Economics, 16th ed., p. 250.
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A land tax is efficient because
there is no economic distortion of
market choices as a consequence of its neutrality.</span> This means
that
there is no wasted economic behavior in the form of excess burden or
deadweight loss typically associated with other tax designs. As an
example of the inefficiencies of other taxes, for example, one might
consider the altered behavior that occurs in consequence of the
presence of the income tax or the sales tax. This deadweight loss in
American and British economies has been estimated to be roughly 20% of
the national domestic product in each nation. Put differently, were
there no deadweight loss as a result of the tax structure, the society
would essentially be 20% more productive &#8212; and 20% richer in the

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax neutrality</strong> refers to the influence (or absence of such)
    that any particular design has on economic behavior. Typically taxes are
    perceived as a damp on economic activity &#8212; taxing income reduces the
    incentive to work, taxing sales discourages retail transactions, and taxing
    savings reduces the propensity to save. The more a tax is perceived to be
    neutral the less the identifiable distortions it imposes on the economy.
    The common assumption of most tax theorists is that all taxes impose distortions;
    it's simply a matter of which ones are least burdensome to economic health.
    A tax which imposes no distortions is ideally best. ...</p>
  <p>The conventional wisdom of most contemporary tax designers, despite lip
    service to the enumerated principles above, is that the best tax regime relies
    essentially upon three tax bases &#8212; property, sales, and income &#8212; perhaps
    ideally in equal weight.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> But
    it is very questionable why, given the measurable and demonstrable virtues
    of taxes upon land bases, one would resort to any other revenue stream. When
    it becomes clear that taxes imposed upon other factors of production effectively
    work their way through the economy to settle ultimately upon land in any
    case, one sees that it simply hamstrings the economy, distorts its natural
    equilibrium, and fosters resentment and challenges to political legitimacy
    every step of the way.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A New Tax Ethic</strong></p>
  <p>Beyond the greater conformity to sound tax principles as noted earlier,
    the taxation of economic rent that accretes as a surplus upon land can offer
    two additional advantages. <strong>The first of these is the removal of the
    distortions wrought upon urban land use configurations and the negative environmental
    impacts which are presently apparent. The greatest of these effects is in
    the form of suburban sprawl, a phenomenon viewed with increasing alarm not
    only by its degradation of life quality but in the increased expenditures
    of time and resources (especially energy). Land use patterns, as intractable
    as they tend to be, will have to modify simply on account of the evolving
    limitations of future life. There are likely to be changes also in the way
    by which air, water, and other public goods are exploited. </strong>Treatment of these
    resources as &quot;free goods&quot; or as captive property of private parties
    will end if it is realized how generous the rental flow to public treasuries
    can be.</p>

    Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Up to recently we have proceeded from a premise that poverty is a consequence
      of multiple evils:</p>
  <p> * lack of education restricting job opportunities;<br>
      * poor housing which stultified home life and suppressed initiative;<br>
      * fragile family relationships which distorted personality development.</p>
  <p>The logic of this approach suggested that each of these causes be attacked
      one by one. Hence a housing program to transform living conditions, improved
      educational facilities to furnish tools for better job opportunities, and family
      counseling to create better personal adjustments were designed. In combination
      these measures were intended to remove the causes of poverty.</p>
  <p>While none of these remedies in itself is unsound, all have a fatal disadvantage.
      ...</p>
  <p>We have come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the
      blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in
      the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust
      people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against
      their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience today by
      being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also know that no matter how
      dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate all poverty.
      ... </p>
  <p>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity,
      which has vanished, and to compress our abundance into the overfed mouths of
      the middle and upper classes until they gag with superfluity. If democracy
      is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this inequity. It
      is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading
      human life by clinging to archaic thinking.</p>
  <p>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel
      and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when
      men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil
      or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us
      to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.
      [end of speech] ... </p>
  <p>[excerpt from book] ... We must develop a program that will drive the nation
      to a guaranteed annual income. Now, early in this century this proposal would
      have been greeted with
        ridicule and denunciation, as destructive of initiative and responsibility.
        At that time economic status was considered the measure of the individual's
        ability and talents. And, in the thinking of that day, the absence of worldly
        goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber. We've come
      a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation
        of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operations
        of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people into idleness
        and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against their will. Today
        the poor are less often dismissed, I hope, from our consciences by being
      branded
        as inferior or incompetent. We also know that no matter how dynamically the
        economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all poverty. ...</p>
  <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
      do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
      must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
      society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
      the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
      when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
      economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
      question,
      you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
      more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
      We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
      But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars
      needs restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my
      friends,
      when you deal with this,</p>
  <ul>
    <li> you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;</li>
    <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;</li>
    <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
              water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are questions that must be asked. </p>
  <p>Now, don't think that you have me in a &quot;bind&quot; today. I'm not talking
      about Communism.</p>
  <p>What I'm saying to you this morning is that Communism forgets that life
    is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of
    Brotherhood
      is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism
      but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines
      the truths of both. Now, when I say question the whole society, it means
    ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic
    exploitation,
      and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils
    that are interrelated. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book excerpt

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b>
</small><br>
<small>Society pays a price for not adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html"><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly many other
problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and

all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome
plight into which we have been led increasingly over the recent years
must be the adoption of land value taxation. </small><small>... <a

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the law of human
progress?&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George saw ours alone among the
civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it."... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Another error made even by academic economists is to confuse the supply of
      land for a particular use, such as housing, with the overall supply of land.
      Of course the supply for a particular use can vary, since, for example, we
      can convert farmland to housing land. But the total area available for all
      uses does not change, and that is the relevant supply.</p>
  <p>The relevance for taxation is that if a plot of land used for a factory is
      taxed, the owner will not suddenly want to convert it into a farm unless its
      use as a factory was suboptimal. If the plot was already being used to maximize
      the rent, taxing it will not change the use. Taxing the site will also not
      make the boundary lines move to the west. Taxing the site will also not affect
      the demand by tenants to use the site. ...</p>
  <p>Impact on behavior</p>
  <p>Income taxes impose on the economy a large administrative cost by government
      and a cost to payers of filling out forms, paying lawyers and accountants,
      and trying to comprehend the complex requirements. The compliance cost of lost
      time in the U.S. is 5 billion hours per year, the equivalent of two million
      people working full time just to process the income tax. In dollar terms, the
      compliance cost is estimated to be more than $200 billion per year.29</p>
  <p>Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware of
      the substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed, is often
      why such reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to discourage borrowing,
      reduce consumption, or encourage savings, for example. But moving to a national
      retail sales tax results in little improvement.</p>
  <p>Most people use their wage income to pay for goods and services and sales
      taxes. Switching from an income to a sales tax is like taxing you when you
      leave a room instead of when you enter the room.</p>
  <p>Income taxes punish savings, but sales taxes punish borrowing. If you borrow
      $10,000 to buy a car and there is a 20 percent sales tax, you need to borrow
      an extra $2,000 to pay the tax. Some folks might decide to not buy the car,
      spending the $10,000 on something else, without borrowing $2,000.</p>
  <p>There is no good economic reason to tax-punish consumption or borrowing. The
      purpose of production is consumption! If we punish consumption, we punish production.
      Consumption is not an evil to be thwarted, but the very benefit we get from
      the economy. We may as well also tax fun and joy! Those seeking to tax consumption
      act as though they have a Puritan streak that considers enjoying goods to be
      evil and working and saving to be good for their own sake.</p>
  <p>Tapping rent or land value, by contrast, avoids the manipulation of an individual&#8217;s
      choice to save or borrow, consume or invest. A well-constructed land value
      levy has no distortive effect at all on human action or decisions, since
    it taps a pure surplus, what is left over after paying for the economic costs
      of production. The effect of shifting public revenue from labor and capital
      to land would be to liberate human action from the disincentives currently
      imposed by other taxes. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
      is Land Rent?</span></small><br>
  <small>John Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor Kingsfield
  in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became the pitchman for
  Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was "We make money the old-fashioned
  way -- we earn it."</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts of others
  seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its cogency in
  contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John Stuart Mill noted
  that</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
      grow richer in their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The
      increase in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an
      entire community, should belong to the community and not to the individual
      who might hold title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1) </span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the unearned
    surplus which classical economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly
    titles -- largely the scarce goods and services of nature like locational
    sites, and has totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the
    primary vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
    recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that comes
    from the investment of the collective community, we could eliminate other
    taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on the economy that makes
    us all poorer. There are many websites that explain how this can be done,
    ways that not only beget greater economic efficiency but also bring about
    economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The surplus
    economic rent that derives from community effort is its rightful entitlement.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of cities
  where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments -- such as
  railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings, hotels and conference
  centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in personal or market exchanges.
  The land value in New York City is higher than all the rest of the New York
  state combined, even though it is only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre
  site south of the United Nations Building was recently sold to a developer
  intent on building luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold
  for $680 million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
  obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land values in any given area tend to rise and fall
  together, and tend also to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical
  survey map. In a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to
  a mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in direct
  proportion to the value of their use, made more or less attractive by whatever
  social attributes are provided in the proximate areas. </span>Two illustrations
  from small and medium sized cities in the United States illustrate the point.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case 1:
      Ithaca, New York:</span> Tompkins County, where the city of Ithaca sits
      at the center, has land values many times those within a short walk. Dividing
      the county land parcels into quintiles, the highest fifth have values of
      $56,000 per acre and above. The lowest fifth have a value of less than
      $3,000 per acre. The high value area collectively constitutes only a minute
      proportion of the total number of square miles because most of it is farm
      or forest land. [see map]</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case
      2: Des Moines, Iowa:</span> Polk County, where Des Moines sits near the
      center, has land values even more disparate between urban and rural locations.
      The highest quartile there are those $97,400 per acre and above, the single
      highest parcel of all worth an astonishing $31.4 million per acre. Yet,
      the lowest quartile, a roughly equal number of far larger parcels, all
      have a value of less than $30,000 per acre. [see map]</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The failure to collect site rent leads
    to a distortion in land use configurations. If patterns unfolded along the
    lines of both social preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites
    would tend to have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend
    to be vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban centers
    sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded by lower-value
    residential land uses, and still further out would be farms and forests.
    The ratio of building to land value, land to total value (or for that matter
    any other ratio between buildings, land, and total values) would be relatively
    constant throughout a region. Instead, the ratio of land value to total value
    consistently tends to reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient
    settlement of land sites is what we know as sprawl. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html"><span
