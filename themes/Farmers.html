<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Farmers
and LVT</strong></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>When people first learn about Land Value Taxation, one of their first reactions
        is often &quot;wouldn't it be extremely tough on farmers?&quot; It turns
        out that this is not the case, for a couple of reasons.</p>
  <p>First, farm land is not particularly valuable land relative to urban land
      or even land in the center of a small town. </p>
  <p>Second, compared to residential and commercial property, it turns out that
      farms tend to have a lower share of their total value in land, because (a)
      farming requires a number of different kinds of buildings; and (b) farming
      requires a lot of equipment, which may be subject to property taxes.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation asks us each to pay our share of taxes based on our land
      value's share of total land value within the taxing entity. It says that the
      value of the improvements we or previous owners have made to the land are inherently
      private, but that the land value, which the individual owner can't claim credit
      for, is fair game for taxation. </p>
  <p>Land value taxation is good for farmers in another important way: it acts
      to slow, and even reverse, urban sprawl. By providing the incentives to put
      centrally located land to its highest and best use, land value taxation prevents
      the premature development of land on the fringe. Farmland stays farmland. Wilderness
      stays wilderness. We don't end up with checkerboard development and long commutes. </p>

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    12. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3. Of the effect upon individuals
    and classes</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital. ... </li>
  </ul>
  <p>And so with the farmer. I speak not now of the farmers who never touch the
      handles of a plow, but of the working farmers who constitute such a large class
      in the United States -- men who own small farms, which they cultivate with
      the aid of their boys, and perhaps some hired help, and who in Europe would
      be called peasant proprietors. Paradoxical as it may appear to these men until
      they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of all classes above
      that of the mere laborer they have most to gain by placing all taxes upon the
      value of land. That they do not now get as good a living as their hard work
      ought to give them, they generally feel, though they may not be able to trace
      the cause. The fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls on them with peculiar
      severity. They are taxed on all their improvements -- houses, barns, fences,
      crops, stock. The personal property which they have cannot be as readily concealed
      or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are concentrated in the
      cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and improvements, which
      the owners of unused land escape, but their land is generally taxed at a higher
      rate than land held on speculation, simply because it is improved. But further
      than this, all taxes imposed on commodities, and especially the taxes which,
      like our protective duties, are imposed with a view of raising the prices of
      commodities, fall on the farmer without mitigation.</p>
  <p>The farmer would be a great gainer by the substitution of a single tax upon
      the value of land for all these taxes, for the taxation of land values would
      fall with greatest weight, not upon the agricultural districts, where land
      values are comparatively small, but upon the towns and cities where land values
      are high; whereas taxes upon personal property and improvements fall as heavily
      in the country as in the city. And in sparsely settled districts there would
      be hardly any taxes at all for the farmer to pay. For taxes, being levied upon
      the value of the bare land, would fall as heavily upon unimproved as upon improved
      land. Acre for acre, the improved and cultivated farm, with its buildings,
      fences, orchard, crops, and stock, could be taxed no more than unused land
      of equal quality. The result would be that speculative values would be kept
      down, and that cultivated and improved farms would have no taxes to pay until
      the country around them had been well settled. In fact, paradoxical as it may
      at first seem to them, the effect of putting all taxation upon the value of
      land would be to relieve the harder working farmers of all taxation.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">*Let us remember that fertility elements put into the soil
            -- or maintained through constant renewal -- are in the economic sense,
            capital rather than land, and under Henry George's plan would not be taxed.
            The farmer who builds up, or maintains, the fertility of his land, would
            not have to pay any higher tax than if he kept it in run-down condition
            and with no buildings, orchards or other improvements on it. H.G.B</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But the great gain of the working farmer can be seen only when the effect
      upon the distribution of population is considered. ...</p>
  <p>...In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
      as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
      His loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
      is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
      or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
      a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
      but it would impoverish no one. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A meticulous study conducted by
Dr. Mason Gaffney entitled "<a href="../docs/Gaffney_RIaFPTR.html">Rising
Inequality and Falling Property Tax Rates</a>"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[31]</span></small>
refutes the common belief that property tax relief would be good for
farmers. His research showed that property tax relief for agricultural
land increases the likelihood that it will attract those looking
primarily for tax shelters and speculative investments. Such
nonproductive incentives ultimately inflate land values overall, making
it increasingly difficult for working farmers to access and maintain
acreage for viable agricultural enterprise.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The high price of land means that the modern food and
agriculture
system provides no options for those who cannot find a paying job other
than subsistence on charity or government supports. Those with minimum
wage incomes are finding it increasingly difficult to afford decent
housing. These social problems and pressures are bound to increase with
the cut-off of welfare and other government subsidies to the poor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Intensively managed small farms and well-designed ecological
villages
could produce a diverse range of food, fiber, livestock, and energy
products for local markets. Bio-intensive farming methods depending on
renewable energy sources can yield both social and environmental
stability. The establishment of labor and bio-intensive small farming
operations can be greatly furthered by land value tax policies which
remove taxes on labor and productive capital while promoting affordable
land access.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A shift to land value taxation
will likely have the following benefits in the rural area:</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; 1. Discourage speculation in land</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 2. Reduce the price of land to equate with its value for
production</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 3. Enable new entrants to more easily obtain land</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 4. Limit farm sizes to those of the most productive units</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 5. Enable the reduction of taxation on earnings and
capital</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 6. Reduce interest rates as land became more affordable</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 7. Prevent rural depopulation</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 8. Encourage owner-occupation rather than absentee
ownership</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; 9. Promote more responsible use of land</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;10. Promote a rural renaissance.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[32]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The success of the Wright Act
is an example of how properly implemented land based taxes can promote
a rural renaissance. </span>This
legislation, passed by California in 1887, allowed communities to vote
to create irrigation districts for the building of dams and canals and
to pay for them by taxing the increase in land value. Once irrigated,
land was too valuable for grazing and too costly for hoarding. So
cattlemen sold fields to farmers at prices the farmers could afford. In
ten years the Central Valley was transformed into over 7,000
independent farms. Over the next few decades, vast tracts of treeless,
semi-arid plains became the "bread basket of America" and one of the
most productive areas on earth. It is a prime example of how land value
taxation can promote and enhance the viability of both an efficient and
equitable agricultural base - without government subsidy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This equitable and successful public finance approach was
eventually
undermined by private banking institutions. Now taxpayers nationwide
subsidize the irrigation needs of agribusiness. Self-financing
development projects reduce the necessity for debt finance, so do not
contribute to the profits of rent-seeking institutions. These
exploitative institutions which concentrate wealth in the hands of the
few will continue to sabotage this policy approach until sufficient
numbers of people have a better understanding of the land ethic of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">koinonia </span>and this fundamental
approach to securing the human right to the earth.</small><br>
<small>One of the best examples of the beneficial results of an ethic
of koinonia in natural resources is to be found in the state of <a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/themes/Alaska.html">Alaska</a>
where an "earth rights" constitution gives ownership of the oil and
other natural resources of the state to the citizens of Alaska on an
equal basis. The Alaska Permanent Fund invests the state's oil resource
rents, the interest from which funds cash dividend payments directly to
all adults and children resident in the state at least one year.</small>

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Forest land yields cash only
once in decades.&nbsp; Some land is valued
mainly for ancillary benefits like the preferential access it gives to
adjoining lands for grazing, recreation, water rights, waste disposal,
information gleaned from mining, etc.&nbsp; Other land is held for its
contingency value, for example for possible future expansion.&nbsp;
Some
is held preemptively to freeze out competition, and some is used (under
current US income tax laws) to yield non-cash tax shelter
benefits.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Part of farmland value is an amenity, especially of course in
pleasant
places. The value of lands held for the owner's recreational pleasure
is
non-cash.&nbsp; Part of the value of media ownership -- spectrum or
newspaper sites -- is power and prestige.&nbsp; Business
sites in Newport Beach give access to water recreation; in Cambridge,
Mass., to intellectual stimulus and hobnobbing.&nbsp; The list of
non-cash service flows from land is much longer and is limited only by
one's observation and insight. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_2RiR.html">Two-Rate in Reverse</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the
rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let
tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small></small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong></small><small><small></small></small></div>

years ago, American
Georgists made a big point that city land
outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands.

standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span

Inequality and Falling Property Tax Rates</a>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.

CONCLUSION</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
... <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><small><i>(11)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms. ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To sum up,
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior wealth can no longer buy in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a given number of farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gamma factors mean the higher quality land is
moving into bigger farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland
and irrigated land in vast farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising P/C ratios reflect a higher LSREV, and they mean it
is harder for a newcomer to acquire any farm acres.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been pulled up.
Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987
Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong><br>
<br>
<b>Concentration of
irrigated land</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Comparing different crops,
high values of GR go with crops

acres and 14 percent of silage corn are irrigated. For tomatoes, GR =

For tomatoes, the top acreage bracket contains 1.1 percent of the
farms, 45 percent of the harvested acres, and 52 percent of the
irrigated acres in tomatoes. For silage corn, the top bracket contains
1.0 percent of the farms, 11.3 percent of the harvested acres, and 26
percent of the irrigated acres in silage corn. ...</font><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The 1940 Census of Agriculture was
the last to separate $L from
$B, overall. In 1940 the <b>building share of real estate value
($B/[$L+B], or <a name="BSREV"></a>BSREV)</b> was .69 in the
lowest acreage bracket, .31 for all farms, and .12 for farms of 1,000

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AELOS (1988) gives no comparable
comprehensive data, but it does
give two series that test the point and have the advantage of
disaggregation. One is for "owner-operators" and one for "landlords

was .63 for farms under 10 acres; .29 for all farms; and .12 for

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small><font
 size="-2"></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. </small><small><a

Common Property in Land is Compatible with the Market
Economy.</span></small><br>
<small>You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources. </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small>To keep land common
while shifting to a market economy,
you simply use the tax system.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can you have both
common land and free markets, you can't have one without the other.
They go together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices
to help identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems.&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The very people who gave us
the term
laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to
measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as recovering the costs of transportation service equilibrates costs
      and benefits on one side of the equation, recovering the economic rent accruing
      to land value facilitates efficient space configurations on the other side.
      Figure 10.2, again conceptually, portrays how the collection of various transportation
      user fees as well as the recovery of land rent corrects the economic distortions
      that today result in sprawl development. The shaded area indicates the pricing
      correctives necessary to ensure that neither urban nor rural land sites are
      disadvantaged in travel or location choices that individuals make for either
      residential or commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>As it happens, collecting land rent is a relatively simple operation: It involves
      a small computer adjustment in the assessment base of what is now the local
      real property tax. The real property tax to an economist is really two separate
      taxes: that put on land value and that put on improvement values. A gradual
      phaseout of the tax on the improvement component, shifting totally to a tax
      on the land, recovers economic rent in a way that satisfies all the principles
      of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[35]</em></strong></font> It
      is efficient, neutral, equitable, administrate, stable, and simple. It is also
      absolutely foolproof: One cannot hide land or take it to a remote tax haven.
      It relieves poor households (who typically own no land) of any tax burden and
      rewards those titleholders who use their sites efficiently. High-value sites
      are induced to construct high-value improvements, and low-value sites are left
      alone. <strong>In this way, central locations, where commercial enterprises
      typically locate, pay according to their intensity; home owners, who typically
      locate
      at the periphery of a neighborhood community, pay moderately; and agricultural
      land and forestlands pay little if anything</strong>. By an automatic and natural
      process, the centrifugal forces of sprawl development are reversed, and investment
      is
      encouraged in core locales. The higher density resulting affords the necessary
      ten to twelve households per acre (or the commercial equivalent) that makes
      public transportation service economically viable, lessening the prospect of
      automobile dependency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[36] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Under the normal system which this article advocates, the user of land would
      pay substantially the same economic rent as now, for the reason that economic
      rent is fixed by the payer and not by the payee; but it would be paid to the
      credit of the community instead of for the benefit of the individual landowner.
      And the economic rent is all the land user would have to pay; no taxes on industry
      or personal product and no other forced contribution for governmental purposes.</p>
  <p>It follows that, under the normal system, the holder of unimproved land would
      usually contribute more than at present toward the expenses of government,
      while the holder of well improved property would contribute, in most instances,
      less than the total of his present taxes.</p>
  <p>To illustrate simply, let us suppose a state which has never parted with its
      natural income but is supported by its own economic rent. A farmer wishes to
      take up a tract or [sic] government land in this state and offers an economic
      rent of fifty cents per year per acre in its raw condition. The government
      (i.e., the community) accepts this rent, subject to re-adjustment every five
      years. The farmer then gets his deed without other cost than that of drawing
      and recording the instrument, or a nominal price of, say, one dollar an acre.<br>
        <br>
        He works his new property vigorously, clears, fences, drains and plants it,
        and puts up his buildings and stocks them. He has no taxes to pay, and at
        the end of his first five-year period he is making $10 per acre per year.
        Will his economic rent for the next five-year period be raised because he
        has prospered or because he has invested money in buildings and improvements?
        Not a penny. All the results of his own capital and labor belong to him and
        not to the community. If the neighborhood has not grown much, and fifty cents
        an acre is still all that is bid as economic rent for the same kind of raw
        ground as our farmer originally took, then his rent for the second five years
        will be the same as the first.</p>
  <p>      But suppose that during the second five years something of a boom has set in,
        and a community is growing up. Land is in demand, and for the lessening area
        in the hands of the government two dollars per acre is freely offered as
        economic rent. Now our typical farmer must come up to the market price and
        pay two dollars an acre for his third five years, irrespective of whether
        he is making more or less out of his place.</p>
  <p>In his third five years the boom continues, and the community grows so fast
      that before the close of that period one corner of our friend's farm finds
      itself near the middle of a flourishing town. Five acres of it are needed for
      a public park, and five acres adjoining are wanted to cut up into building
      lots. As building lots, this part of the land will command a voluntary offer
      of a hundred dollars per year per acre of economic rent; and this fact establishes
      the land-value of the adjoining five acres needed for park purposes.</p>
  <p>In this situation what shall our farmer do?</p>
  <p>He has two courses open to him. If he doesn't want to relinquish his land,
      and can afford to withhold it from further improvement, he can pay the hundred
      dollars per acre per year of economic rent which these ten acres will now command,
      and keep his farm intact. If this appears to him too costly a luxury, he can
      signify his willingness to sell to the town the five acres wanted for the park,
      and the other five to individual builders.</p>
  <p>Now, what price should he get for it? He did not pay the government much for
      his title deed, but he has worked on this land for fifteen years, and deserves
      some compensation when he transfers it. By his labor and also, in part, by
      reason of his clearing, draining and fencing, he has been able to make twelve
      dollars an acre from his ground, while his economic rent had not until now
      gone above five dollars an acre. Furthermore, he has built on these parcels
      a barn and two storehouses.</p>
  <p>The method of computing the proper selling price under such circumstances
      would have to be the result of experience, but that price would certainly include
      the present value of the improvements and probably some lump sum besides, as
      compensation for loss of farming opportunity. But just as certainly it would
      not include, (as it would do under our present conditions), the increased location
      value which the town itself has created by its own growth and public works,
      and which in all justice belongs to the town or community and not to the individual.
