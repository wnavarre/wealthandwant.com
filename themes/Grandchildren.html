          I found moving: <em><strong>how do we love all the children -- our children,
          our grandchildren, everyone's grandchildren, and future generations? </strong></em>How do we design our systems

<blockquote>
  <p>The real estate boom is a familiar phenomenon. Most people are predicting
    that it will, if not burst, at least wilt. But the basic components aren't
    going to change, not unless we have a catastrophe of sorts, something economists
  don't feel obliged to integrate into their speculations.</p>
  <p>The components are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> a relatively wealthy community;</li>
    <li> the hard desire to own one's own house, along with the ambition to make
          it more and more comfortable and pleasing;</li>
    <li> the dependence of building sites on immediate amenities (sewage, power);
          and</li>
    <li> strategic sources of nourishment (jobs).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The convenience of infinitely available land faded as urbanization brought
    on heavy dependence on elements that weren't always available to homes on the
    range. Schools and hospitals are not only useful for educating children and
    curing the infirm. They are necessary to attract affluent home buyers.</p>
  <p>Jon Gertner, writing for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, gives a useful
    account of the home-building industry. Here are some basic indices. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have 34 million rented apartments at this point and 74 million owner-occupied
          homes. </li>
    <li>The pool is being fed
        <ul>
          <li>by immigrants seeking houses, </li>
          <li>by children growing and seeking their own homes, and </li>
          <li>by the elderly wanting a second house in which to vacation or retire. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The home-building industry has constructed about 13.5 million single-family
        homes since the mid-1990s.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
  <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
      The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my
      kids are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready
      to buy.</p>
  <p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
    matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
    kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that house
    will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot; ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read

  Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html">A Bill of
    Economic Rights and Obligations</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Preamble</b>
</small><br>
<small>Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created
equal,
that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights,
and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In living, expressing our liberty,
and pursuing happiness we
sometimes conflict with one another, so we need a shared
understanding of the extent of the sphere of equal rights given to
every person, and beyond that sphere our obligation to respect the
rights of others. This Bill is concerned with the economic aspects of
these rights and obligations. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In fulfilling its obligation to
ensure that future generations had
opportunities at least as great as those of the present generation,
people would want to take account of:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. The amount of land per
capita, adjusted for the quality of land;<br>
2. The level of technology that will be available;<br>
3. The education and any initial wealth that is provided to all
children;<br>
4. The level of public infrastructure;<br>
5. The level of public debt;<br>
6. Environmental quality;<br>
7. The price of depletable natural resources.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Decreases in some items could be
offset by increases in others. If
people wanted to have more children than could be provided with
opportunities equal to those of the present generation, Congress and
state legislatures would have an obligation to tax those who wanted
to have children, so that people would have fewer children, and so
that all children could be provided with an initial endowment upon
attaining maturity, to compensate for reductions in other items on
the list.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html"><span

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In general, young
persons will benefit more than older persons from a move to site
value rating, because they tend to own less expensive plots of land
if they own land at all, and they have many years ahead of them to
benefit from reduction in other taxes. Those who are yet unborn will
benefit most of all, because their birthrights to equal shares of the
provenance of nature, as well as to the product of their labour, will
be recognized. Net financial losses will tend to be greatest for
older persons. Their houses will fall in sale value. They will be
required to pay annually the rental value of the land on which their
houses sit, without as much in reductions of their income taxes, and
with fewer years ahead of them to reap tax savings. On the other
hand, they will have less concern about providing for their children,
because houses will be much easier for their children to acquire.
Further offsetting any claim to compensation would be any past
unearned profits that potential claimants had made on ownership of
land. ... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span
