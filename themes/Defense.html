<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WOULD THERE be enough revenue for
the public sector? To address
this question, one should consider different types of public
activities separately. The type of public activity that can most
readily be financed by charges for exclusive access to natural
opportunities is local public services. When these are desired by
voters and provided efficiently, they tend to raise the rental value
of land by enough to pay for themselves, since a local public service
provides a benefit in a limited region, and people will bid up the
rental value of that land by the value of access to the
service.<font size="-2"><small><i>2 </i></small></font> Thus local
services can be
financed without even beginning to draw on the value of opportunities
provided by nature.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another broad area of public
spending is national <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense</span>.
While
defense increases the value of land in a dangerous world, one might
reasonably hope that the need for defense spending would be greatly
reduced in a world that had adopted a general norm of acknowledging
the equal rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To the extent that defense costs
are raised when a nation becomes
a more attractive target-- because of increases in its stock of
capital or in the productivity of its citizens--it would be efficient
and not unreasonable to have an annual charge on capital and on
talent (an asset protection fee) to defray these costs. Such a fee
could be collected by a self-assessed tax. For capital, the tax
could be enforced by an obligation to sell the capital at the
self-assessed price. For talent, the tax could be enforced by a rule
that if a person was injured in an accident and wished to sue for
loss of earning power, the self-assessed value of the person's talent
would be the upper limit on the damages that could be claimed. It is
likely that a tax rate of two or three tenths of one percent per year
would suffice to fund the current level of U.S. defense spending. But I
would hope and expect that defense spending would fall
substantially. Between the reduced need for defense spending and an
efficient asset protection fee for the extra defense costs generated
by increases in capital and talent, it should be possible to finance
defense without exhausting the rental value of exclusive access to
natural opportunities.</small></p>

  <p><small>The next major area of
          government spending to consider is social

    <p>What, then, about public goods that have benefits over greater areas?
      If only a few localities are involved, one might expect them to negotiate
      voluntary
        compacts with reasonable efficiency. "Pork
    barrel" projects--all projects with benefits for only a small region of the
    country--should not be paid for with national taxes. The practice leads to
    the approval of inefficient
    projects as a result of the politicking of those who benefit, and it unjustly
    exploits those
    who do not benefit.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For truly national public goods, other
          ideas must be explored.</span> One of the major national public goods is
          defense. In a perfectly just world, everyone would be so respectful of
          the rights of others, and everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending
          would be desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want
          public defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?</p>
    <p>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
        can be provided by a Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital,
        which makes a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S.
        requires a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it
        is because the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a more
        attractive target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital might reasonably
        be charged for the increase in the defense budget that is needed to make
        other citizens as safe as they would be if that one person's capital were
        not adding to the attractiveness of nation as a target. It would be interesting
        to know how much of the defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per
        year on the value of all assets and contractual rights, to pay the costs
        of defense. The owner assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and
        if anyone wants to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There
        could be a personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption
        for personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of local
        police and courts.</p>
    <p>An even greater share of the federal budget is used for various programs
        that provide help for people with special needs--welfare, Medicare, Medicaid,
        Social Security, unemployment insurance, disaster assistance, etc. Some of
        these programs (social security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation)
        are funded in part by payments by prospective beneficiaries. But all incorporate
        substantial elements of deliberate redistribution. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>
