Tax Relief</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of local candidates and state candidates get elected on  platforms of
      &quot;property tax relief.&quot; Targeted property tax relief is sometimes
      used as an incentive to attract corporations that promise to be good corporate
      citizens
      or create jobs. Targeted property tax relief is used to encourage the development
      of downtown areas that are blighted, relieving the developer and the purchaser
      of downtown properties from paying property taxes for 10 or so years.</p>
  <p>But platforms calling for property tax relief seldom talk about reducing spending
      in an amount equal to the property tax relief, so they are either talking about
      property tax relief for some small group, to be paid for by other groups of
      property owners, or they are talking about increasing other taxes: taxes on
      sales, or on wages. When we tax sales, we burden the poor and we decrease the
      deman for the products we tax. When we tax wages, we discourage job creation
      and steal from those who work the product of their labor. </p>
  <p>But when we tax land value, we collect for the commons a portion of the value
      of land. That value doesn't result from anything the individual landholder
      does, but from factors beyond his reach: population growth, natural amenities,
      common investment in infrastructure and services.</p>

Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
State law allows the SID to contract with the landowner as follows.<small>
<small><small>You don't have to pay your annual charge
in
cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></small></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a
good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;We also hear, sometimes,
that "it's never been done," or
it's only been done by our drab neighbor Pennsylvania, for whom
familiarity may have bred contempt? Only "far kine have long horns."
Or, whatever progress ensued there was happening anyway. We are
destiny's tots in the grip of cosmic forces. We rise and fall with
the tide. We cannot control Fate; relax and accept what the gods dish
out. Fatalism: it's a sure recipe for milling around ineffectually
while life passes us by.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Domain and Government Giveaways<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... But if the properties had
been reassessed on a regular basis, with
market-based values assigned first to the land and the residual being
assigned to the existing buildings, the homeowners themselves would
have been in a position to make their own rational decisions on whether
it was worth it to them to continue to occupy extremely valuable land
(and pay the taxes on it), or more to their advantage to accept an
offer from someone who was prepared to put it to a higher and better
use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I am sympathetic to those who want to occupy their homes
forever, but
if those homes are located on land that is valuable (because of its
views or water access or transportation services, for example) or
becomes valuable because of surrounding development, it seems fair that
they compensate the rest of us for holding up progress, for continuing
to occupy as single-family residences, land which it is now time to
develop into something that produces good results for the entire
community.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or
something else
that was a highly appropriate use for its site -- and typical of the
neighborhood -- 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial
buildings. The home or diner is something everyone else has to walk
around, drive around. If that site were well developed, it could
prevent the premature development of far less desirable sites on the
fringe of town -- an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
acres on the fringe.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Should we protect the right of elderly people to stay in their
homes,
at the expense of the rest of the community? Should we protect the
right of a young person who shares that home to stay there for an
entire lifetime, at the expense of the community? I'm comfortable with
the idea of allowing the elderly person to defer payment of the
property taxes, with interest-bearing debt accruing against the
property until it is sold or transferred. It seems to me to be an
acceptable tradeoff, even if it creates potholes in the redevelopment.
But his heirs should not inherit it until the lien is satisfied, which
will usually mean that at last it will be developed consistent with the
neighborhood.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed,
land
first and buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which
tell us when it might be time to move on. ... <a
