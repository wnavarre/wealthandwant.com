<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>A lot of land that <em>shouldn't</em> be built
  on is being used because the more choice land is being held off the
  market, unused or underused.&nbsp; Owners are speculating on it, or underusing
  it, forcing others onto slippery hillsides, riverbanks, etc.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Generally it is poor people who live on the land that shouldn't be built
    on, but sometimes it is the  wealthiest members of our society, as in the
  case of barrier islands and hurricane-prone beaches.</p>
  <p>Our wetlands need to be kept as wetlands, and not privatized as the object
    of land speculation or development which benefits the few and endangers many
  more.</p>
  <p>If we fix the perverse incentives which cause good land to be underused
    and force some of us onto land that shouldn't be used, we will remove the
    distortions that cause many of our serious problems, including sprawl and
    poverty and the huge range of problems they cause.        </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Looking for Mr.
Goodbar</b>
</small><br>
<small>Here is how we get urban sprawl with leapfrogging. Remember the
last time you moved and went househunting? You saw some mouthwatering
homes, but they were not for sale. You had to find motivated sellers,
and pick from what they offered. It's the same with builders. They
scour the exurbs seeking motivated sellers. Ideally the most
motivated sellers would line up by distance from the existing city,
but the market is not ideal. Each seller is moved by his personal
circumstances, not the geographical location.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Potential builders are little
concerned with the social costs they
might impose, so long as others are to bear them. Thus, they
sometimes settle for and build

with flammable brush and erosion problems,</small></li>
  <li><small>on flood plains (like
Victoria Woods subdivision in Riverside), 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on soils subject to
liquefaction in quakes (like Northridge),

  <li><small>in canyons and arroyos,

  <li><small>on

lands without water supply, even in arid southern California, then

rejected a recent move to ban development in areas with no assured
water supply.... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Hammer's Law</b></p>
  <p>At the same time, in both countries you find something I will call Hammer's
    Law. This is not a carpenter's tool but again the name of a man, an economist
    in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that <b>if you compared population to land
    values in the different counties of his State (in the very poor counties of
    the Ozarks the land was hard scrabble land of very little value, with the very
    rich lands in the north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you
    found that the population density was much greater on the very poor land of
    the Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest.</b> He took
    this to be a sign of market failure. Three years later the Establishment got
    to him and he said, well maybe I can rationalise this after all. But actually
    it's the American counterpart of the familiar pattern in the less developed
    countries where the flat land, the good flat land, is used for grazing cattle
    at a very low level of productivity, and the mass of the people in their minafundia
    are found on the hard scrabble land on the steep hill sides. I call it <b>Hammer's
    Law of Market Failure</b> where, because of the operation of the land market,
    whose evils we are so familiar with, you do not get the population distributed
    over the land in an economically rational manner, because of the tendency of
    the better land to be agglomerated into large holdings which are not optimumly
    developed. Comparing States, this results in the fact that a poor State like
    West Virginia has large numbers of people living on very poor land, and a wealthy
    State like Iowa (speaking now just of farming) has a small number of people
    on very good land. And this results in inter-jurisdictional equalisation problems.
    In Canada this takes the form of the Maritime provinces in the east being densely
    populated like the Ozarks and the wealthier, in a sense, western provinces
    being underpopulated. ... <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">read the whole
