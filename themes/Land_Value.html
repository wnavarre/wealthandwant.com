      <p>As society becomes more complex, as population increases,
        as technology advances, as local, state and federal government invests
        in infrastructure, in education, in hospitals, in libraries, in public
        transportation and highways and airports, land values rise. The individual
        landowner (residential or commercial) doesn't have to lift a finger!
         Those who have title to the best-located land get the biggest benefit.
        And when
        they pay their property tax, they pay back 1% or 2% (often less, particularly
        in California and Florida, due to perverse laws) of the increase in land
        value each year, but keep the other 98% as if it
        was
        something
        they
        were entitled to! Further, when they sell the property, they get to keep
        the first $250,000 or $500,000 of gain (after deducting every expense
        they can think of), and then are taxed rather lightly on the remainder.
        Finally,
        when a landholder dies, his basis in the property is &quot;stepped up&quot; to
        its value on the date of his death, and most of that value never gets
        taxed, because fewer than 2% of estates pay any tax at all. </p>
      <p>Talk about
          privatizing
          something that the public creates! Talk about a free lunch for some,
          at the expense of others!  There's no such thing as a free lunch &#8212;          it
          comes from somewhere. It comes from our young people, our tenants,
          our posterity. It is theft of the labor of some to subsidize the ease
          of others.</p>

    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>        God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
        altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold
        when men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations
        and complex industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores
        of millions, in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so
        far that large numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users,
        it still remains true that we are all land animals and can live only
        on land, and that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one
        can be deprived without being murdered, and for which no one can be compelled
        to pay another without being robbed. But even in a state of society where
        the elaboration of industry and the increase of permanent improvements
        have made the need for private possession of land wide-spread, there
        is no difficulty in conforming individual possession with the equal right
        to land. For as soon as any piece of land will yield to the possessor
        a larger return than is had by similar labor on other land a value attaches
        to it which is shown when it is sold or rented. Thus, the value of the
        land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements in or on it,
        always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all are entitled
        in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer or successor
        of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
      <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of
        common ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses
        what value attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on
        it. The principle is the same as in the case referred to, where a human
        father leaves equally to his children things not susceptible of specific
        division or common use. In that case such things would be sold or rented
        and the value equally applied.</p>
      <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
        men, would have the community act.</p>
      <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
        letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the
        task, impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in
        equal shares; still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so
        divided.</p>
      <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
        with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
        to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value
        of the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements
        on it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues,
        we would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes
        now levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes,
        since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements
        of the right of property.</p>
      <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as
        a conforming of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
      <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that
        clash.</p>
      <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
        is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each
        one has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
      <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has
        intended all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
      <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there
        must be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry
        may be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
      <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those
        socialists referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation
        of men in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right
        of private property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical
        seem to argue, that to secure the right of private property we must ignore
        the equality of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say
        the one thing or the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s
        laws.</p>
      <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
        of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
        both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
        and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

      <p>Place one hundred men on an island from which there is no escape, and
        whether you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine,
        or the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference
        either to him or to them. In the one case, as the other, the one will
        be the absolute master of the ninety-nine &#8212; his power extending
        even to life and death, for simply to refuse them permission to live
        upon the island would be to force them into the sea.</p>
      <p>Upon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause
        must operate in the same way and to the same end &#8212; the ultimate
        result, the enslavement of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure
        increases which compels them to live on and from land which is treated
        as the exclusive property of others.</p>
      <p>Yet, it will be said: As every man has a right to the use and enjoyment
        of nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the exclusive
        right to its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his labor.
        But there is no difficulty in determining where the individual right
        ends and the common right begins. A delicate and exact test is supplied
        by value, and with its aid there is no difficulty, no matter how dense
        population may become, in determining and securing the exact rights of
        each, the equal rights of all.</p>
      <p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is
        not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines
        its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is
        no better than other land which may be had for the using can have no
        value. And the value of land always measures the difference between it
        and the best land that may be had for the using. Thus, the value of land
        expresses in exact and tangible form the right of the community in land
        held by an individual; and rent expresses the exact amount which the
        individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal rights of
        all other members of the community. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/06_The_Remedy.htm">read

    some other human creature for the privilege.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>I do not mean to say that even after you had set right this
    fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this I
    do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of all

    reform as you may, you never can get rid of wide-spread poverty so long
    as the element on which and from which all men must live is made the
    private property of some men. It is utterly impossible. Reform

    co-operative stores; divide profits, if you choose, between employers
    and employed -- and what will be the result? <span

    shows this<span style="font-weight: bold;">. Do not all improvements
    simply increase the value of land &#8212; the price that some must pay others
    for the privilege of living?</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Consider the matter, I say it with all reverence, and I merely
    say it because I wish to impress a truth upon your minds &#8212; it is
    utterly impossible, so long as His laws are what they are, that God
    himself could relieve poverty &#8212; utterly impossible. Think of it and you
    will see. Men pray to the Almighty to relieve poverty. But poverty
    comes not from God's laws &#8212; it is blasphemy of the worst kind to say
    that; it comes from man's injustice to his fellows. Supposing the
    Almighty were to hear the prayer, how could He carry out the request so
    long as His laws are what they are?</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Consider &#8212; the Almighty gives us nothing of the things that
    constitute wealth; He merely gives us the raw material, which must be
    utilised by man to produce wealth. Does He not give us enough of that
    now? How could He relieve poverty even if He were to give us more?
    Supposing in answer to these prayers He were to increase the power of
    the sun; or the virtue of the soil? Supposing He were to make plants
    more prolific, or animals to produce after their kind more abundantly?
    Who would get the benefit of it? Take a country where land is
    completely monopolised, as it is in most of the civilised countries&#8212;who
    would get the benefit of it? Simply the landowners. And even if God in
    answer to prayer were to send down out of the heavens those things that
    men require, who would get the benefit?&nbsp; ... <a

Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal&nbsp;</a>
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in
this world, and in our civilization. There is a provision made by the
laws of the Creator which would secure to the helpless all that they
require, which would give enough and more than enough for all social
purposes. These little children that are dying in our crowded districts
for want of room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a
great estate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Did you ever consider the full meaning of the significant fact
that as progress goes on, as population increases and civilization
develops, the one thing that ever increases in value is land?
Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever there
is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a great
city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the bounty
of the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or an oil
well, or a gas deposit, there the speculator jumps in, land rises in
value, and a great boom takes place, and people find themselves
enormously rich without ever having done a single thing to produce
wealth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that land steadily
increases in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to
it; that the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s
goodness in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use
adds to the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This
natural fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law
of the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is the intent of this natural law of increasing land
values? Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land
values grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to society as a whole, with which we
may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with which we may meet
public expenses, and do all the things that an advancing civilization
makes more and more necessary for society to do on behalf of its
members?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Today the value of land in New York city is over a hundred
million annually. Who has created that value? Is it because a few
landowners are here that that land is worth a hundred million a year?
Is it not because the whole population of New York is here? Is it not
because this great city is the center of exchanges for a large portion
of the continent? Does not every child that is born, every one that
comes to settle in New York, does it not add to the value of this land?
Ought it not, therefore, get some portion of the benefit? And is it not
wronged when, instead of being used for that purpose, certain favored
individuals are allowed to appropriate the fund of land values?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

must always pay the owner for it in rent; while if the user be also the

the Object -- Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We do not propose a tax upon land,
as people who misapprehend us
constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">we propose a tax
upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax
that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
increment;</span> that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes
to
the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, the distinction between a
tax on land and a tax on land
values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But a tax on land values
cannot fall on all land, because
all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
valuable land in proportion to its value;</span> therefore, it can no
more
become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
privileges of any kind. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It can merely
take from the individual, not
the earnings of the individual, but that premium which, as society
grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior quality. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Tax buildings, and you will have
fewer or poorer buildings; tax
farms, and you will have fewer farms and more wilderness; tax ships,
there will be fewer and poorer ships; and tax capital, and there will
be less capital; but you may tax land values all you please and there
will not he a square inch the less land. Tax land values all you
please up to the point of taking the full annual value &#8212; up to the
point of making mere ownership in land utterly unprofitable, so that
no one will want merely to own land &#8212; what will be the result?
Simply that land will be the easier had by the user. Simply that the
land will become valueless to the mere speculator &#8212; to the dog in
the manger, who wants merely to hold and not to use; to the
forestaller, who wants merely to reap where others have sown, to
gather to himself the products of labour, without doing labour. Tax
land values, and you leave to production its full rewards, and you
open to producers natural opportunities. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What is the reason that land in
San Francisco today is worth so
much more than it was in 1860 or 1850? Why is it that barren sand,
then worth nothing, has now become so enormously valuable? On account
of what the owners have done? No. It is because of the growth of the
whole people. It is because San Francisco is a larger city; it is
because you all are here. Every child that is born; every family that
comes and settles; every man that does anything to improve the city,
adds to the value of land. It is a value that springs from the growth
of the community. Therefore, for the very same reason of justice, the
very same respect for the rights of property which induces us to
leave to the individual all that individual effort produces, we
should take for the community that value which arises by the growth
and improvement of the community. </small><small><a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The Single
  Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What we propose is not a tax on
real estate, for real estate
includes improvements. Nor is it a tax on land, for we would not tax
all land, but only land having a value irrespective of its
improvements, and would tax that in proportion to that value. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think about what the value of land
is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. Justice therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider the difference between
the value of a building and the
value of land</b>. The value of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community. It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is thus a violation of justice
to tax labor, or the things
produced by labor, and it is also a violation of justice not to tax
land values.&nbsp; <strong>...&nbsp;</strong> <a style="font-weight: bold;"

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
  Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of
Taxation </b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It was but a short step from the
ethics of property to the ethics
of taxation. George's position here was that as labor and capital
rightfully and unconditionally own what they produce, no one can
rightfully appropriate any of their earnings; nor can the State. On
the other hand, land value is always a socially created value, never
the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this is a
value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs.
Furthermore, to charge the owner for this value, in the form of
taxation, is only to collect from him the precise value of the
benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on
products, George spoke of "...all
taxes now levied on the products and processes of industry -- which
taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be
infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of
the justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith
speaks of incomes as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and
this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
property is commonly insisted upon -- that it is equally protected by
the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of
property is made possible by the state -- that there is a value
created and maintained by the community, which is justly called upon
to meet community expenses. Now of what values is this true? Only of
the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a
community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the
growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists.
Scatter again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would
have no value at all. With every increase of population the value of
land rises; with every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is,
therefore, the most just and equal
of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a
peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the
benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use
of the community, that value which is the creation of the community.
It is the application the common property to common uses."... <a

features that
give value to a plot of land.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">None

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The size of the plot, its natural resources
and natural fertility are gifts of nature.

  <li><small>To the extent that value

is governments that give value to land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>To the extent that value

the users of those nearby sites that give value to land.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The unimproved value of land is
in no way attributable to actions
of the person who holds title to the land.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Of course, when land is
used, people add improvements, and the
value resulting from the addition of improvements to land is value to
which a user of land can have a respectable claim. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the fee that
the public can properly require of the user of improved land is the
rent that the land would command if it were unimproved. This fee
should not be higher for land that is extensively improved than for
similarly situated land that is less highly improved. </span>The art
of
assessment, discussed in a later section, deals with the estimation
of such values.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Replacing Existing
Taxes</b>
</small><br>
<small>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the
public
treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing
sources of public revenue.</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><small>Those who contribute
labor to productive processes should be allowed to keep the wages that
result from their labor.</small></li>
<li><small>Those whose saving makes the creation of capital possible
should be allowed to keep the interest that accrues from the use of
capital.</small></li>
<li><small>But there is no one who has a corresponding claim to the
return to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and
other opportunities assigned by government ought to be the primary
source of government revenue.</small></li>
</div>
<small>While one might call such fees "taxes," we consider that
designation inappropriate, because the word "tax" connotes an
exaction from someone of something to which he or she has a just
claim, and we deny that there are such just claims with respect to
land. We expect that the collection of fees for the full value of
opportunities assigned by governments would provide adequate revenue
for all necessary government expenditures.</small>&nbsp;

Ethics of Coercion in Public Finance</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If land were uniform in its
economic potential and there were no
depletable natural resources, the application of such a rule would be
straightforward. But land is not economically uniform and there are
depletable natural resources, so the problem of equal access is
conceptually more difficult.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To consider a simple case first,
suppose that there is no
disagreement about the relative value of land in different places and
that there are no depletable natural resources. Equal access to
natural opportunities is satisfied if the ratio of aggregate land
rent to population is the same in all jurisdictions. Equal access is
also satisfied if there is a set of transfer payments among
jurisdictions, such that the ratio of the sum of aggregate land rent
and net transfers received to population is the same in all
jurisdictions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land in these formulas
is not calculated on a
site-by-site basis, but rather on an aggregate basis, under the
assumption
that there are no man-made improvements in the territory being
evaluated. Thus, in asking whether the United States was claiming
more than its share of natural opportunities, one would ask what the
rental value of the territory occupied by the U.S. would be if it
were completely devoid of human improvements and human habitation,
and the only bidders were other nations or their citizens. A similar
calculation would be made for every other nation. Of course there can
be no guarantee of agreement about such valuations, but agreement on
the need to make such estimates and to try to reach consensus on
their magnitudes would constitute enormous progress in global
justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Next, suppose that there are
depletable natural resources.
</b>This raises two new issues: appropriate depletion and
intergenerational equity. Appropriate depletion is depletion on a
path that maximizes the present value of net returns from using a
resource. Devising a set of incentives that identify and achieve
appropriate depletion is not an issue of justice and is therefore
outside the scope of this paper. ... </small><small>&nbsp; <a

incentives to work, and raising incentives to allocate both land and
capital to personal pleasure instead of earning cash by serving
others.) </small><br>
<br>
<small>High land values may also affect interest rates indirectly by
reducing

For creating land, thrift is not needed,

however high, stimulates no thrift.&nbsp; Land rent may be taxed
heavily
without discouraging capital&nbsp;formation.&nbsp; Indeed it
would certainly encourage capital formation to lower the level of land
prices,&nbsp; because there is a diminishing marginal utility of
assets to private holders.&nbsp; The loss of land values would
stimulate
new saving to make up the loss.

value
is derived solely by discounting future ground rents, which are not a
reward or incentive for creating land.</small>
<dt> <br>
    <small>With capital the sequence is that persons save to form capital, a
    lump sum, which then yields a service flow.&nbsp; Capital formation precedes and
    causes the service flow.&nbsp; With land the sequence is reversed.&nbsp; The service
    flow is a free gift which simply exists.&nbsp; The buyer does not create it, nor
    cause others to create it; he simply acquires it.&nbsp; The expected service flow
    is then converted by arbitrageurs (economic men) into a lump sum present
    value.&nbsp; That process is called &quot;capitalizing,&quot; i.e. making land superficially
    resemble capital for purposes of exchange.&nbsp; However, it is land price that
    adjusts to a given rent, rather than rent's being determined at a level sufficient
    to reward producing the asset.&nbsp; The interest (or capitalization) rate at
    which rent is converted to price is determined by the supply of and demand
    for real capital, not land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ....</strong></small><br>

  rate double and the present value is halved.&nbsp; Compare the present value of
  a steer to be slaughtered in one year: let the interest rate double from 5%

Jarvis will cut land taxes some more, or that future building costs

</span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>What's won or lost is a value generated by
society. That is,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> land rises in value </span></small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where a new resource is
discovered (during a gold rush, more money is made by land developers
than by prospectors), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where population grows (see the Sun
Belt and
verdant Northwest), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where technology advances (witness
the land values
in the various Silicon Valleys, Forests, etc), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where infrastructure
expands (e.g., near a new road or sewer), and 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where society cooperates
(e.g., in communities that organize street fairs, neighborhood watches,
etc). 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>These factors driving land value are not
improvements made by
lone owners but by the entire community. The closest correlation to
land value is density and no one person creates that. Hence the site
value levy merely puts public values in the public treasury for public
benefit, as untaxing homes, sales, and income leaves
privately-generated values in private pockets. </small></font><small><strong>... </strong></small><font size="3"><small><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>While the PTS is already gaining
attention,
there are issues which, were they addressed, would facilitate the
spread of the idea. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>One issue is external to the
movement, lying in the
broader society. <span style="font-weight: bold;">People consider land
speculation, reaping megaprofits
from fast-developing areas, as something normal. </span>Most people
fail to
realize that there is a commonwealth of socially-generated economic
values apart from values individually-generated. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding who
creates land value is crucial to the success of the PTS. </span>While
this may
not be an issue that lends itself easily to a mass educating campaign,
some effort to raise public awareness of its own assets must be made.
In doing so, advocates would learn how best to present the distinction
between what's ours and what's not. </small></font><small><strong>...</strong></small><font size="3"><small>    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html">How Profit
Shapes Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Without spending a penny of
subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
<strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The present property tax works
backwards, like an
intruder from the anti-universe. It
increases as owners
improve their property; it decreases
when owners let
buildings dilapidate. "Save money,
create slums," cities
tell owners.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Some owners do keep prime sites
covered with parking
lots or abandoned buildings while
waiting for land
values to rise. "Good numbers are hard
to come by,"
notes <a href="../auth/Batt.html">Bill Batt</a>, former fiscal policy
researcher for the
New York legislature, "but easily a
quarter of a US city
is under-utilized." Thus
urban cores decay, an
entropy that seems
natural and inevitable yet
is policy-induced.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> If the property tax is a
centrifugal force that
flings structures
outward, its opposite is
a land levy, a centripetal
force that pulls development inward.
To pay this
charge, owners try to put their
parcels to better use.
"Owners of the most valuable sites,
paying the most,
try hardest," explains Tom Gihring, a
Seattle-based
consultant.. "Since the most valuable
lots lie about the
center, it is the center which draws development." In-fill
happens.&nbsp;
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> The world looks different to owners
dozing at the wheel,
waiting for land values to rise.
Title-holders keeping
prime downtown sites vastly
underutilized "now pay
only, say, $25,000 per year in
property tax for a half
block," figures <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Dr. Mason Gaffney</a>
of
the University of
California at Riverside. "Post-PTS
(property tax shift),
these owners of parking lots and
abandoned
warehouses might have to part with
three times that
amount each year." At $75,000 per
annum, no longer
could they afford to let prime sites
lie relatively idle.
"They'll put their land to uses that
generate much more
revenue than does an empty building or
car-covered
lot," adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy
building
apartments, stores, offices, schools,
theaters, mixing
all uses together to maximize their
return." </small><br>
<br>
<small> Post-PTS, would these speculators
turned developers
find customers? Or would potential
customers continue
to set up shop and home out in the
cheaper 'burbs?
Many house-hunters are drawn to where
all the
amenities are in walking distance.
Many shopkeepers
locate where people walk about. Other
businesses
collect themselves close to their
suppliers and
customers. There are plenty of takers
for new
downtown development.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> At least that's what land values tell
us. Land values
merely reflect the desirability of
locations. The more
people want on, the more they must
pay. The lots that
people are willing to pay the most for
are the heart of
the city.&nbsp;
... </small><br>
<br>
<small> In New York, the city council keeps
Manhattan&#8217;s Central
Park unbuilt not because Greens rule
the Big Apple but
because property values overall are
higher with the park
than with luxury condos on the site.
Land value is at its
maximum when land use is at its
optimum - mixed use
including non-use. Batt adds, "the
higher land value is,
the more revenue there is for public
benefit. Limiting a
locality&#8217;s funding sources to
land value puts
government squarely on the side of the
land&#8217;s health."&nbsp;<strong>
... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land value in many cities
is
astronomical.</span>
Tapping it, a locality could fund
basic services, repeal
other taxes, and pay residents this
income supplement
from the surplus, much like
Alaska&#8217;s oil dividend (that
Gaffney consulted on). Being included
in the
apportioning of ground rent, residents
might be more
likely to warm up to the idea and urge
its adoption. And
the bigger the share, the stronger the
longing.&nbsp;
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> Although society may have a feeble
claim to many of
the things it taxes, land value is
precisely what society
should not forgo. It&#8217;s not lone
owners but the
community who generates this value by
its
infrastructure and its mere presence.
Leaving ground
rent uncollected constitutes a
"giving" that communities
and eco-systems can ill afford. Let's
wean owners from
socially-generated site values and
make urgent their
hunger, and they'll hunt up their own
built value where
it's needed.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> To use land wisely, her value needs to
be disbursed
fairly. Collecting land value while
removing taxes upon
buildings organically puts structures
where they&#8217;re
supposed to go. The PTS can do so as
long as we ride
this planet around the sun.

Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of my talk is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.&nbsp; </span>... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
industrialization and urbanization in the
second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The apostle of land taxation is Henry George. In his famous book
<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a> he develops
his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of
the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap
large
profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
out of the market. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that
has
taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
properties.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes
on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are
low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Relatively low taxes on land and
high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many
disadvantages besides: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really
needed; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the building developer has to go far out to find available
land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>traffic on congested roads will increase and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>new roads and schools will have to be built.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is generally believed that zoning
laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities.
Zoning laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody
can be forced to improve his land and to build unless there is an
incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning
laws. With
both these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but
-- as experience has shown -- without land taxation rational and
efficient land usage becomes impossible. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The reform of our property tax system must be regarded as one of
the
most urgent and important task we face today. ... <small><small><big><big><a

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Values intended by
Providence for Public Purposes.</b>
</small><br>
<small>I have already observed that the chief peculiarity of the land
of
a country was that its value was never stationary, that it was always
progressive and rising, that in fact it increased in a direct ratio
with the growth of the population and the advancing progress of the
industry of the nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would seem as if Providence had
destined the land to serve as a
large economical reservoir, to catch, to collect and preserve the
overflowing streams of wealth that are constantly escaping from the
great public industrial works that are always going on in communities
that are progressive and prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the permanent improvements
that are made in the land
itself, and which increase its productiveness and value, there are
other industrial works not carried out on the land itself, but on its
surroundings and in its vicinity, and which enhance its value very
considerably. A new road is made for the accommodation of a district;
a new bridge is thrown across a river or a stream to make two
important localities accessible to each other; a new railway passes
close by and connects it with certain large and important centres of
industry; a new factory or a new mill is erected, or a new town is
built in the neighbourhood.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Industrial works like these add
very materially to the value of
all the land in their vicinity. It is a well-known fact that a new
railway has in several instances doubled the value of the land
through which it passed, in consequence of the increased facilities
it had afforded for the sale of its agricultural products.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In every state of society, which
is progressive and improving,
such industrial works are continually going on, and hence the value
of the land is rising also everywhere. But its value rises enormously
with the enlarged growth of the population of a nation, and with the
increased productiveness of its industry. <strong>...</strong></small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
know of a mechanical
force more powerful than anything the vaunting engineer of Syracuse
ever dreamed of. It is the force of land monopoly; it is a screw and
lever all in one; it will screw the last penny out of a man's pocket,
and bend everything on earth to its own despotic will. </span>Give me
the
private ownership of all the land, and will I move the earth? No; but
I will do more.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> I will undertake to
make slaves of all the human
beings on the face of it. Not chattel slaves exactly, but slaves
nevertheless. What an idiot I would be to make chattel slaves of
them. I would have to find them salts and senna when they were sick,
and whip them to work when they were lazy.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No, it is not good enough. Under
the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;
they would dive into the bowels of the earth for its hidden
treasures; they would build cities and construct railways and
telegraphs; their ships would navigate the ocean; they would work and

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see: As
I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I<span style="font-weight: bold;"> should accept the
highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves.&nbsp; </span>...

Everett
Gross: <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">Explaining Rent</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it's difficult for
people to understand the meaning of
"rent" as an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it
doesn't use the word rent. I just use a little analogy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a
small town of 5,000 people.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Suppose a man comes to
Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs a building, but first
he needs a piece of ground to build this new building on. So he looks
up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the real estate
agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The man asks
the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this land?"
The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
$50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is
good, the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue
crew is good and very fast, and business is good here." </small>
  <p><small>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a
fair price. I'll take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school
people, and the road people, and the police department? To whom do I
pay the $50,000?" And the real estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay
it to them. You pay it to the person who owned the land before."</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads,
and the police, and the other good things?" And the real estate agent
says, "<i>If</i> you build, then you'll pay for them again."</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now I&nbsp;don't need to use the
word "rent" in that
explanation.</small></p>
Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Cannan.html">Cannan's Law</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred
Marshall</span>, disguising
his boldness under a mousy writing
style, proposed an even stronger supplement to the land tax. He
would make the tax base the capital value of land, rather than the
annual cash value, to tap "the part of the real annual value of land
which does not appear in a money form &#8230; ". Repeating himself
for emphasis, he says that taxing capital value will "bring under
taxation some real income, which has escaped taxation merely because
it does not appear above the surface in a money form." That is,
Marshall wants the national tax to fall on imputed land income, an
enormous annual flow of value that now totally escapes income
taxation. </small><small><br>
<br>
And what is the value of land under old buildings? Marshall
writes no nonsense about seeking the depreciated value of the old
building first.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Land value is the
opportunity cost of the site
itself: what land would bring "if cleared of buildings and sold in a
free market."</span> <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(32)</i></b></small></font>
Imagine
how
that set of policies, from this prissy pillar of property and
propriety, would radicalize national taxation in any modern state.

<p>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Geoist_Crusoe.html">A
Geoist Robinson Crusoe Story
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, Robinson G.
Crusoe was the only survivor of a ship
that sunk. He floated on a piece of wood to an unpopulated island.
Robinson was an absolute geoist. He believed with his mind, heart, and
soul that everyone should have an equal share of land rent.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since he was the only person on
this island, it was all his. He
surveyed the island and found that the only crop available for
cultivation was alfalfa sprouts. The land was divided into 5 grades
that could grow 8, 6, 4, 2, and zero bushels of alfalfa sprouts per
month. There was one acre each for 8, 6, and 4, and 100 acres of
2-bushel land. For 8 hours per day of labor, he could work 4 acres. So
he could grow, per month, 8+6+4+2 = 20 bushels of alfalfa sprouts, much
more than enough to feed on.<br>
<br>
One day another survivor of a sunken ship floated to the island. His
name was Friday George. Friday was a boring talker and kept chattering
about trivialities, which greatly irritated Robinson. "I possess the
whole island. You may only have this rocky area," said Robinson.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robinson realized that it did
not matter which lands he possessed. He
could possess better land, but so long as the rent is split equally, if
the wage rate is equal, their income will not be affected. Lawyers say
that possession is nine tenths of the law, but the law of rent says,
possession does not matter.</small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
If the rent is split equally, those who possess land and want to
maximize their income will possess only that amount that maximizes
income for all. If they possess too much land, they would drive wages
down and rents up, leaving less for the possessors. So it does not
matter who owns what land, if the rent is equally split. ... <a
