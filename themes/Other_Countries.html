<small>As important as our ideas are for the justice and efficiency of
the American economy, their application is even more important in
less developed countries, where often 80% of the land is held by 3%
of the population. To give all the citizens of these countries
chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which
inevitably winds up putting land into the hands of people who cannot
use it well) but by requiring any one who uses land to pay according
to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring
this message to the world, we must first apply it to ourselves.

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">The
Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The
Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of the factors that makes
the case for secession difficult is
the problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the
people who called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria
in the 1960s, the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact
that, if they had succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate
oil resources from the rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the
efforts of the Chechins to separate from Russia is explained in part
by the understanding that, even though the Chechins have been abused
by Russians for centuries and have never fully acceded to their
incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya were allowed to separate from
Russia, that would create a precedent that would make it difficult to
oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely populated Yakutsia
region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds, to insist that
they too have a right to be a separate nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps, a general recognition of
a right of secession will need
to wait for another component of moral evolution: a recognition that
all persons have equal claims on the value of natural opportunities.
If this were recognized, then any nation or region with
disproportionately great natural resources would be seen to have an
obligation to share the value from using those resources with those
parts of the world that have less than average resources per capita.
This would eliminate the desire to appropriate natural resources as a
reason for secession and as a reason for opposing secession. Signs of
a recognition of the equal claims of all persons on the use of
natural opportunities are slim. One can point to John Locke: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>Whether we consider natural Reason, which tells
us, the Men, being once born, have a right to their Preservation, and
consequently to Meat and Drink, and such other things, as Nature
affords for their Subsistence: Or Revelation, which gives us an account
of those Grants God made of the World to Adam, and to Noah, and his
Sons, 'tis very clear, that God, as King David says, Psal. CXV. xvi.
has given the Earth to the Children of Men, given it to Mankind in
common.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke goes on to say that every
person has a right to himself, and
therefore to the things of value that are created by combining his
efforts with natural opportunities, "at least where there is as much
and as good left in common for others." He then argues that with so
much unclaimed land in America, no one can justly complain if all of
Europe is privately appropriated. Locke does not address the question
of how rights to land should be handled if there is no unclaimed
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thomas Jefferson, writing on the
subject of patents, said, But
while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of
property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit
a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by
those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual
has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for
instance.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George said,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The equal right of all
men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the
air--it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence. For we
cannot suppose that some men have the right to be in this world and
others no right. </small>
  <p><small>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator,
we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty--with an equal right to the use of all that nature so
impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable;
it is a right which vests in every human being as he enters the world,
and which during his continuance in the world can be limited only by
the equal rights of others.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>4</i></b></small></font></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>General recognition of the equal
rights of all to the use of land
and other natural opportunities is hard to find. When the powerful
nations of the world got together to eject Iraq from Kuwait, very
little was heard of the bizarreness of supposing that Emir of Kuwait
and his relatives had a right to all the oil that lay under Kuwait.
Some recognition of equal rights to the use of natural opportunities
can be found in the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty, which would have
had all nations benefiting from the granting of franchises to extract
minerals from the sea. From an economic perspective, the treaty was
flawed by the fact that it would have created an artificial scarcity
of seabed mining activities in order to raise revenue, and it was
opposed by the U.S. and not implemented. But it did suggest general
recognition of global equal rights to at least those natural
opportunities that no one has yet begun to use.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One impediment to the recognition
of equal rights to the use of
natural opportunities is that some system of assessment would be
needed to identify the transfers that would compensate for unequal
access to natural opportunities. Another impediment is that a system
of rewards for those who discover new opportunities would be needed.
But if there were a will to address them, these technical
difficulties could be solved adequately, as they are in jurisdictions
such as Alberta, Canada, that claim all mineral rights for the
government...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html"><span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Several countries have taxed land on the national
level. On the other
side of the Pacific Rim, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan levied a
federal land tax for a while. Repeating the success of California,
Taiwan was able to redistribute huge plantations into many family-sized
farms. Recently, in an attempt to control their skyrocketing location
values, both Japan and Korea have begun to tax land, though only at low
rates.<br>
<br>
Taiwan instituted land taxation during the 1940s to redistribute land
and increase food production. Prior to the arrival of the Nationalist
Party, most of the island's people were landless peasants and were
afflicted with hunger. Less than 20 families monopolized the entire
island. So the new Nationalist government implemented its "land to the
tiller program," which taxed farm land according to its value. Soon the
large plantation owners found themselves paying out about as much in
taxes as they were getting back as rent. Being a middleman was no
longer worth the bother, so they sold off their excess to farmers at
prices the peasants could afford, which, according to the World Bank,
lay the foundation for subsequent rapid development. Working on their
own land, new owners felt inspired to work harder. They produced more,
kept more, and lived better. Twenty years later, Taiwan had growth
rates of 10% per annum in their GDP and 20% in their industry, while
from 1950 to 1970 population growth dropped 40% and hunger ceased.<br>
<br>
Denmark, during the 1950s, tried to move toward a land tax nationwide.
In 1957 the tiny Georgist Justice Party won a few seats and was
accepted into the ruling coalition. Land speculators feared that the
rest of parliament would go along with shifting taxes toward land. So
investors shifted their portfolios from speculation to production. One
year later, inflation had gone from 5% to below 1% ; bank interest
dropped from 6.25% to 5%. By 1960, 100,000 unemployed had found jobs in
a country of just five million people. Nevertheless, next election, the
landowners spent enough money to sway public opinion and removed the
Justice Party from parliament. Speculation was safe again. Inflation
quickly climbed back up to 5% and by 1964 reached 8%. From 1960 to
1981, land prices skyrocketed, increasing 19-fold while prices of goods
and services increased merely fourfold. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Abroad, during the last year or two, a few
jurisdictions have turned to
taxing land. Estonian officials felt that they had little choice; all
other taxes are too difficult to collect. If a government is willing to
evict owners who fail to pay, the land tax is easy to collect. Unlike
wealth, land can not be moved or hidden and its owner must step forward
to retain hers (sic) possession. Colombia, whose cities are swamped by
squatters, has granted mayors the power to negotiate a land tax with
individual land owners in the hope that a higher charge will stimulate
development of underutilized sites, generating more affordable housing.<br>
<br>
Cape Town, South Africa, quit the regular property tax in favor of a
land levy. Altho' sited on one of the world's major shipping lanes,
Cape Town's development had always lagged behind the inland
Johannesburg, an abandoned mining town that prospered in part from
levying only locations and not any improvements. Not knowing what to
expect in the aftermath of apartheid, Cape Town's civic leaders wanted
to ease the transition to a sound, integrated economy. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Cities with either a phased-in two-rate
land-weighted system, as in Pennsylvania, or with a full land tax, as
in Australia and New Zealand, have consistently shown that:
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Taxes on the majority of
owner-occupied and rental homes were reduced.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> The steep escalation of housing
prices
and rents experienced by most US cities was averted in the two-rate
cities as housing supplies increased.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Construction and rehabilitation of
homes, stores, and offices increased.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Central business districts drew
more private investment and were renewed.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> More efficient land use followed
putting the city's idle lots and under-used buildings into productive
use; reducing the pressure for urban sprawl.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>Australia has operated under various forms
of
site value taxation for nearly a century. Many studies have estimated
the improved rates of construction, housing, rise in wages, and even
expanded agricultural lands under land value taxation in Australia. Two
cities fully exempt buildings. Canberra, the nation's capitol, exists
on public land and leases lots. Sydney taxes land, not buildings.
Neither one recovers all the land's annual market value and rely on
some revenue from the federal government. Yet their lower-income areas
appear much more livable than the dilapidated ghettos of many US
cities. In the two most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales,
revenues from land taxes increased significantly in the eighties. In
Victoria revenues nearly doubled and in NSW, they nearly tripled from
1984 to 1990, accounting for inflation.<br>
<br>
In 1951 the federal government also taxed land. All states except
Victoria still have a land tax in some form. Over the last two decades,
the percentage of government revenue collected in land rent at all
levels was estimated to drop from 6.3 percent to 3.7 percent. In the
recent decade, under influence of wealthy interests most states have
diluted the land tax. <br>
<br>
Following this trend away from capturing unearned land values,
municipal revenue from property rates has fallen to 50 percent of the
budget. One city, Hervey Bay, Queensland, now collects only about 20
percent of its revenues from site-values. Fixed charges or fees for
particular purposes have gained popularity instead, including a minimum
rate for all properties in some instances. Nationwide, all levels of
government collected $148 billion in 1993-94. One estimate suggested
that the present uncollected annual rental revenue in Australia would
be about $40 billion, depending on the capitalization rate used.<br>
<br>
Despite this drift away from site rent, especially among
municipalities, a two-volume report commissioned by the Brisbane City
Council in 1989 found significant advantages to taxing land. Comparing
it to taxes on "heads" (the poll tax), sales, income, improved property
value, and license fees, the research committee unanimously rated
"rating" (the Aussie term for taxing property whether land or building)
as best. They stated, <i>"In
principle, the unimproved value of land is a logical and appropriate
basis for revenue raising irrespective of the level of government."</i>
They noted that land taxes are virtually impossible to evade, tap every
member of the community, are simple and inexpensive to administer, and
its compliance costs for citizens are minimal.<br>
</small></font></small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small><b>New Zealand's Experience<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small> Kiwiland has used the land
tax for over 100
years, political pressures along with economic swings have whittled it
down to 0.4 percent of the federal budget in 1989. That year it became
a political football. Since 1896, the federal government had
independently recorded the market values of the land, the improvements,
and the composite or capital value. In 1989, federal authorities
reassessed land during a sharp rise in commercial values, primarily in
Auckland (which doesn't collect land rent); but they actually collected
the revenues a year later when land values suddenly fell. Genuine
inability to pay ensued.</small></font></small></p>
<small><font size="3"><small>
The previous ruling party, the National Party, raised the rate on
commercial land as it exempted all rural land. That gave a nice tax cut
to 1,300 of the richest people in New Zealand. Where sites were
underdeveloped, perhaps due to the ineffective level of the land tax,
too few site users could manage to pay the tax. The resulting hardship
reinforced the ruling Labour Party's right-wing proposals for
abolishing the land tax and replacing it with taxes on goods, services,
and users. More recently, since 1991 the land tax as such is considered
a dinosaur on a national scale, although some 90 percent of the
municipalities employ land-value rating (rates are levied on the rental
value a property as assessed by the city council annually). Since
Wellington has adopted capital value rating (the regular property tax),
its renewal has faltered. Most recently the concept of "resource
rental" is floated in national debates as a substitute for taxes on
land and capital assets. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that.</small></font> <a
