</blockquote>
<p>Robert H. Browne: <a href="../docs/Browne_Lincoln_Men.htm">Abraham Lincoln
    and the Men of His Time</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand to the
    plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is many man doing
    his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now a word more
    about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever they may be: We
    are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction of slavery or
    believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for years. We are called
    so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in derision, to abase us, and
    enable the defamers to make successful combinations against us. I never was
    much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I favor the best plan to restrict
    the extension of slavery peacefully, and fully believe that we must reach
    some plan that will do it, and provide for some method of final extinction
    of the evil, before we can have permanent peace on the subject. On other
    questions there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but now it
    would be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have on hand.<strong> But
    when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest content while
    oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home, his
      sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any man, corporation,
      society, or unfriendly Government, any more than the air or the water,
      if as much. An individual company or enterprise requiring land should hold
      no more in their own right than is needed for their home and sustenance,
      and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent management of
      their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted when it
      creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be held for
      the free use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long
      as they are so occupied.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the future.
      The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists,
      agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against it,
      with whatever force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and carried
      on as it can be by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and the titled
      and untitled senseless enemies of mankind everywhere.&#8221; </strong>... <a href="../docs/Browne_Lincoln_Men.htm">read

<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Either the land of Ireland
rightfully belongs to the Irish
landlords, or it rightfully belongs to the Irish people; there can be
no middle ground. If it rightfully belongs to the landlords, then is
the whole agitation wrong, and every scheme for interfering in any
way with the landlords is condemned. If the land rightfully belongs
to the landlords, then it is nobody else's business what they do with
it, or what rent they charge for it, or where or how they spend the
money they draw from it, and whoever does not want to live upon it on
the landlords' terms is at perfect liberty to starve or emigrate. But
if, on the contrary, the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the
Irish people, then the only logical demand is, not that the tenants
shall be made joint owners with the landlords, not that it be bought
from a smaller class and sold to a larger class, but that it be
resumed by the whole people. To propose to pay the landlords for it
is to deny the right of the people to it. The real fight for Irish
rights must he made outside of Ireland; and, above all things, the
Irish agitators ought to take a logical position, based upon a broad,
clear principle which can be everywhere understood and appreciated.
To ask for tenant-right or peasant proprietorship is not to take such
a position; to concede that the landlords ought to be paid is utterly
to abandon the principle that the land belongs rightfully to the
people.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To admit, as even the most radical
of the Irish agitators seem to
admit, that the landlords should be paid the value of their lands, is
to deny the rights of the people. It is an admission that the
agitation is an interference with the just rights of property. It is
to ignore the only principle on which the agitation can be justified,
and on which it can gather strength for the accomplishment of
anything real and permanent. To admit this is to admit that the Irish
people have no more right to the soil of Ireland than any outsider.
For, any outsider can go to Ireland and buy land, if he will give its
market value. To propose to buy out the landlords is to propose to
continue the present injustice in another form. They would get in
interest on the debt created what they now get in rent. They would
still have a lien upon Irish labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And why should the landlords be
paid? If the land of Ireland
belongs of natural right to the Irish people, what valid claim for
payment can be set up by the landlords? No one will contend that the
land is theirs of natural right, for the day has gone by when men
could be told that the Creator of the universe intended his bounty
for the exclusive use and benefit of a privileged class of his
creatures &#8211; that he intended a few to roll in luxury while their
fellows toiled and starved for them. The claim of the landlords to
the land rests not on natural right, but merely on municipal
law &#8211; on municipal law which contravenes natural right. And,
whenever the sovereign power changes municipal law so as to conform
to natural right, what claim can they assert to compensation? Some of
them bought their lands, it is true; but they got no better title
than the seller had to give. And what are these titles? Titles based
on murder and robbery, on blood and rapine &#8211; titles which rest on
the most atrocious and wholesale crimes. Created by force and
maintained by force, they have not behind them the first shadow of
right. That Henry II and James I and Cromwell and the Long Parliament
had the power to give and grant Irish lands is true; but will any one
contend they had the right? Will any one contend that in all the past
generations there has existed on the British Isles or anywhere else
any human being, or any number of human beings, who had the right to
say that in the year 1881 the great mass of Irishmen should be
compelled to pay &#8211; in many cases to residents of England, France,
or the United States &#8211; for the privilege of living in their native
country and making a living from their native soil? Even if it be
said that might makes right; even if it be contended that in the
twelfth, or seventeenth, or eighteenth century lived men who, having
the power, had therefore the right, to give away the soil of Ireland,
it cannot be contended that their right went further than their
power, or that their gifts and grants are binding on the men of the
present generation. No one can urge such a preposterous doctrine.
And, if might makes right, then the moment the people get power to
take the land the rights of the present landholders utterly cease,
and any proposal to compensate them is a proposal to do a fresh
wrong.&nbsp; ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<blockquote>
  <p>I begin the publication of this paper in response to many urgent requests,
      and because I believe that there is a field for a journal that shall serve
      as a focus for news and opinions relating to the great movement, now beginning,
      for the emancipation of labor by the restoration of natural rights.</p>
  <p>The generation that abolished chattel slavery is passing away, and the political
      distinctions that grew out of that contest are becoming meaningless. The work
      now before us is the abolition of industrial slavery.</p>
  <p>What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of
      all; what is produced by the individual belongs rightfully to the individual.
      The neglect of these simple principles has brought upon us the curse of widespread
      poverty and all the evils that flow from it. Their recognition will abolish
      poverty, will secure to the humblest independence and leisure, and will lay
      abroad and strong foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure
      the full recognition of these principles is the most important task to which
      any man can address himself today. It is in the hope of aiding in this work
      that I establish this paper.</p>
  <p>I believe that the Declaration of Independence is not a mere string of glittering
      generalities. I believe that all men are really created equal, and that the
      securing of those equal natural rights is the true purpose and test of government.
      And against whatever law, custom or device that restrains men in the exercise
      of their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness I shall
      raise my voice. ... <a href="../HG/short/Salutatory_1887Std.htm">read the whole column</a></p>

    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic

    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. ...</p>
  <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the
      supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power.

    them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here is a piece
    of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a building site, or
    it might be something else - if there was only one man who wanted it, of

Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>
