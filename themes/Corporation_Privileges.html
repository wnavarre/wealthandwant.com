    <p>      Robert G. Ingersoll: <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay
      Sermon</a> (1886)    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
      any land that he does not use.
      Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
      millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
      I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
      it. And why? Don't you know that if people could bottle the air, they
      would? Don't you know that there would be an American Air-bottling
      Association? And don't you know that they would allow thousands and
      millions to die for want of breath, if they could not pay for air? I am
      not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
      to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
      that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
      I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
      been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
      to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
      thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
      invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
      his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
      privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
      him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a
      few landlords and millions of tenants.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The tenement house is the enemy of modesty, the enemy of virtue,
      the
      enemy of patriotism. Home is where the virtues grow. I would like to
      see the law so that every home, to a small amount, should be free not
      only from sale for debts, but should be absolutely free from taxation,
      so that every man could have a home. Then we will have a nation of
      patriots.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Now, suppose that every man were to have all the land he is able
      to
      buy. The Vanderbilts could buy today all the land that is in farms in
      the State of Ohio -- every foot of it. Would it be for the best
      interest of that State to have a few landlords and four or five
      millions of serfs?...<a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html"> <span

  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Times have caught up with
      Ingersoll. Ronald Coase, prominent
      Chicago economist, says polluters (whom he calls emitters, to avoid
      bias) have as much right to emit as victims (he says receptors) have
      to breathe clean air. It doesn&#8217;t matter, says Coase, how we
      assign property rights originally: as long as property is firm, the
      market will sort it all out. However, since emitters have invested in
      costly facilities, and property is sacred... you see whither this
    unbiased science is tending.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Was he laughed to scorn? <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Au
      contraire</span>, he was raised on the
      shoulders of his adulatory peers and anointed a demi-god (which tells
      you something about his peers). Having risen on wings of theory the
      idea found its way into practice, and today The South Coast Air
      Quality Management District awards "offset rights" to those with
      worthy track records of emitting. New emitters must buy "property
    rights" from old ones.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In effect, we don&#8217;t fine people
      for emitting, we reward them
      with a right to continue. Then we can pay them to stop, by buying
      back the right we just gave away. This is putting the free market to
    work, they say.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And those who want to breathe?
      Coase says they should pay for the
      privilege, as they pay for indulging any personal taste. After all,
      they already pay those who supply them with land to live on. Only
      welfare bums would expect property owners to dip into their
      hard-earned savings and supply them with free air, when the market
      has a solution at hand. All they need do is buy offset rights from
      Ancient and Honorable Emitters. When they want to breathe, they just
      retire the rights upwind of them. This is a marvel of efficiency,
      too. They retire only what it takes to clean the air they need: no
    waste.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If they can&#8217;t afford to buy
      outright, they could rent --
      markets have ingenious solutions for all problems, like any good
      panacea. Gas masks are another free-market solution: much better than
      socialistic policies that would impose uniform clean air on everyone,
      whether they want it or not.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_BTA.html">

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Go into Pennsylvania, and there
      you will see great stretches of
      land, containing enormous deposits of the finest coal, held by
      corporations and individuals who are working but little part of it.
      On these great estates the common American citizens who mine the coal
      are not allowed even to rent a piece of land, let alone buy it. They
      can only live in company houses; and they are permitted to stay in
      them only on condition (and they have to sign a paper to that effect)
      that they can be evicted at any time on five days&#8217; notice. The
      companies combine and make coal artificially dear here, and make
    employment artificially scarce in Pennsylvania.</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, why should not those miners,
      who work on it half the time,
      why shouldn&#8217;t they dig down in the earth and get up coal for
      themselves? Who made that coal? There is only one answer &#8212; God
      made that coal. Whom did He make it for? Surely you would say that
      God made it for the people that would be one day called into being on
      this earth. But the laws of Pennsylvania, like the laws of New York,
      say God made it for this corporation and that individual; and thus a
      few people are permitted to deprive miners of work and make coal
      artificially dear.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-2">[07]</font> Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual conversion
        of government into something independent of and beyond the people, and the
        gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &#8212; though not necessarily
        a class marked off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history
        shows, personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the concentration
        of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each
        knows his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
        enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city, as we
        have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers to gain and
        hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State
        legislatures, the growth of the country and the greater number of interests
        make the proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents
        know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
        departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
        of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
        by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
        but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
        any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
        misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
        continued to abhor
        the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
        at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
        more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
        political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
        in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
        day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
        what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
        government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
        something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
        free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
        their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
        The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
        the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
        suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
        see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
        without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
        vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
        How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
        of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and. urged by starvation, must
        bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
        tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
        I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
        to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
        of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize, and they listen to quacks
        who propose to cure the symptoms without touching the disease. &quot;Let us
        elect good men to office,&quot; say the quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds
        by sprinkling salt on their tails!</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[13]</font> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of popular government
        in the United States is clearly a failure. Not that it is a failure everywhere
        and in everything. An experiment of this kind does not have to be fully worked
        out to be proved a failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from
        the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our government
        by the people has in large degree become, is in larger degree becoming, government
        by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[14]</font> The people, of course, continue to vote; but the people are losing their
        power. Money and organization tell more and more in elections. In some sections
        bribery has become chronic, and numbers of voters expect regularly to sell
        their votes. In some sections large employers regularly bulldoze their hands
        into voting as they wish. In municipal, State and Federal politics the power
        of the &quot;machine&quot; is increasing. In many places it has become so strong
        that the ordinary citizen has no more influence in the government under which
        he lives than he would have in China. He is, in reality, not one of the governing
        classes, but one of the governed. He occasionally, in disgust, votes for &quot;the
        other man,&quot; or &quot;the other party;&quot; but, generally, to find that
        he has effected only a change of masters, or secured the same masters under
        different names. And he is beginning to accept the situation, and to leave
        politics to politicians, as something with which an honest, self-respecting
        man cannot afford to meddle. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>

      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Only around 25-30% of
      households own their own homes. By good fortune,
      I just read something that helps resolve the difficulty. It seems that
      a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive Era had
      been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas A.
      Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure
      inventor. Much of this legislation became unravelled under President -
      guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and
      political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and
      monopolization then ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has
      played a role in this. Disney as real estate developer throws its heavy
      weight around brutally.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and
      what it
      would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
      think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
      promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers,
      monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after
      all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive Movements. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform.
      Some
      of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
      of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
      program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
      free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
      and workers.</small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;</small><br>
      <small>Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
      Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
      which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs in
      the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
      which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the
      device of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive
      privilege, it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting
      abuses of power.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a

            property: from means to end</b>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In a proper view of things, I submit, private
        property is a means to an end. It is not an end in itself; it needs a
        functional rationale. The end is to get land put to the best use. All
        the
        private land in the world was originally granted by some sovereign
        public person or body, mainly for that purpose, not as a welfare
        entitlement. Landowners and their lawyers have slyly, over time,
        turned the means into an end, a fetish they endow with "sanctity."
        This is a term they borrowed from absolutist medieval theology.
"Sanctity" means the quality or state of being holy or sacred, hence
        inviolable. It means property may not be challenged, or even
        questioned. It has become an end in itself, its own voucher. </p>
      <p>You're
          not even supposed to think about it, it is above thought. Taboo!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Neoclassical economics, historically, marked
      the final, total surrender of the profession to this fetish. The modern
      economist's
      view runs something like this: "I pledge allegiance to the 14th
      Amendment, and to the overinterpretation of private landowner
      supremacy for which it has come to stand." It is ironic to recall
      that Radical Republicans passed that Amendment, at a time when a
"Radical Republican" was one who favored freeing the slaves. The 14th
      Amendment was designed to protect the rights of freedmen. As
      interpreted now, the 14th Amendment means that The Emancipation
      Proclamation itself was unconstitutional! Fortunately, no one has
      brought that case - yet.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The Neo-classical economists' view of their
        proper role is rather like that in The Realtor's Oath, which includes
        a vow "To protect the
        individual right of real estate ownership." The word "individual" is
        construed broadly to include corporations, estates, trusts, anonymous
        offshore funds, schools, government agencies, institutions,
        partnerships, cooperatives, the Duke of Westminster, the Sultan of
        Brunei, the Medellin Cartel, Saddam Hussein, congregations,
        Archbishops, families (including criminal families) and so on, but
"individual" sounds more all-American and subsumes them all. This is
        a potent chant that stirs people to extremes of self-righteousness
        and siege mentality when challenged.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The resemblance between Neo-classical economics and the Realtor's
        Oath is easier to understand when you learn that Professor Richard T.
        Ely, founder of the modern discipline of Land Economics, was heavily
        subsidized by the National Association of Real Estate Boards, the
        utilities, the major landowning railroads, and others of like mind
        and property interests.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When it comes to violating property
        rights, air pollution today is
      perhaps the greatest invader and confiscator of property. </span></p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Where
              do
              economists stand? Once a few of them tried to say, following A.C.
              Pigou, "let the polluter pay," and in parts of Europe they still do.
              In our modern backward thinking here at home, however, it's not the
              polluter who is invading the property of others, nor the human rights
              of those not owning property. Rather, when you tell them to stop, the
              government is invading their rights. The wage-earning taxpayers must
              pay them to stop, else you are violating both the 14th Amendment and
              the "Coase Theorem," a rationalization for polluting now dearly
              beloved by Neo-classical economists.

    </span></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Common Property in Land is
      Compatible with the Market
    Economy.</small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
      You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
      sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
      to make a
      hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
      economists
      and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
      enjoy the other.
      These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
      you with
      loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
      variously call
      Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
      glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
      control your
      resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
      market economy,
      you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
      property takes in
      a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
      just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
      how; but in
      the answers lie success or failure.
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
      only can you have both common
      land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
      together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
      identify land's taxable
      surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
      costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
      the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
      truly free
      market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
      and
      capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
      this second
      point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
      OECD nations that
      now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
      make
      all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
      own abysmal
      systems.

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
      slogan at the core of a
      free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
      central part of their
      program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
      Century, sometimes
      called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
      and who inspired land
      reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
      Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
      A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
      accurately called it the<span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
      </span></small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      </small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
      learned to measure land values,
      and we have broadened
      the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
      </span>Agrarians will be relieved,
      and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
      well down the
      list in terms of total
      market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
      farms; only the very best
      soils in the best locations yield much taxable
    surplus.</span>&nbsp; <strong>...&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>Another natural resource (hence
        part of "land"), whose
        nature and value the mass
        of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
        spectrum</span>. In this age of
        communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
        than the rockets
        launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
        through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
        satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
        but space junk.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">One
        minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
        bundle of spectrum rights
        for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
        for $12 billions. Then Mr.
        McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
        American, in a firm
        called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
        amass radio spectrum
        rights around the entire world, including your part of the
        world, in the hope of
        dominating worldwide communications.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Radio spectrum is a
        natural resource, and
        it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
        U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
        comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
        Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
        anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
        lease it for a limited time, so
        you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
        on the professional help
        you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
        contracts are complex, and
        are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
        </span></small><br>
        <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set
        of
        valuable resources.</span> The
        values involved are
        gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
        firms was valued at $260
        billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
        budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
        parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
        nations, including some of your
        neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
        revenues. Norway pays for a
        lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
        so valuable that the mere
        change in their appraised value in several recent years
        has exceeded the entire
        GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
        production, they may
        be the largest in the world.
        </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small>World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
        there is another side to this.
        The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
        oil in Russian terms,
        because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
        government has recognized
        this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below that there is a much more effective
        way to tax resource
        rents. </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska
        holds
        down its other taxes by
        socializing part of its
        oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
        the major stockholders of
        two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
        other taxes, it pays
        each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
        of over $1,000 per year.</span> Go thou and do likewise. Your expert,
        Dmitri Lvov from the Russian Academy of
        Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
        could cover most of
        your national budget from your enormous production of oil
        and gas. &nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
        Venezuela or Nigeria have
        fabulous mineral oil that
        they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
        sophisticated or ruthless foreign
        corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
        reap the gains.</span> The
        question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
        and become a poor
        resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
        sovereignty over your
        own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
        look no further than
        Norway for a model.
        </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have
        great
        value, too.</span> Many
        nations, even backward
        ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from "hardrock" minerals.
        Bolivia, Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
        Zaire, and Zambia
        have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
        years; Chile, Thailand
        and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.
        Saskatchewan, a
        Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
        uranium; Minnesota, an
        American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
        nations fail to raise much
        revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
        like S. Africa with its gold
        and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
        with its lead mines and
        reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
        wealth that you can and
        should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
        people. </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life,
        and the
        most valuable
        natural resource is water. </span>For
        example, in southern California we need water so much we
        import it from the
        Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
        through the long San Joaquin
        Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
        tunnel it through the
        San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
        gets here, it
        supplements and competes with local water that nature
        provides freely in the
        Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
        then has a value equal
        to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
        That value in the local
        waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
        to take that surplus
        value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
        and worse, we actually
        subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
        dams, canals, and
        pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
        asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
        that is called "dissipating
        rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
        time we learned to husband
        and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
        surplus. So should you, in
        comparable circumstances. &nbsp;</small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
        generate power.</span> Again,
        California witlessly fails to
        socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
        has shown the way.
        British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
        Quebec, and other provinces
        raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
        water. Russia, with some of
        the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
        same, or better.
        </small><br>
&nbsp;
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
        value.</span> In the past most
        nations have let this rent
        be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
        and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
        the number of licenses and
        boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
        It created large rents,
        where previously there were little or none, by preventing
        overfishing and the great
        waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
        fishing effort. That is a good
        example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
        necessary before you can
        collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
        give away this net benefit
        to private parties. </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
        these
        licenses, but simply
        gave them away to owners
        of existing boats, and others with political influence.
        Each license now sells for
        something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
        instant millionaires and
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
        giveaway to the few, and takeaway
        from the many,
        created an instant class society where before there were
        equal access and equal
        opportunities. </small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
        privileges are worth so much that there are now
        documented cases off
        Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
        catch. </span>The captain, the
        crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
        the dangers and
        discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
        with the other 30%. Parlor
        fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
        socialized, relieving the
        workers from taxes.
      </small><strong>...</strong>      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></p>
      <p>      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse
          subsidies." </span>These
          are subsidies
          that encourage
      harmful things like </small>        <small></small></p>
    </div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>polluting air and water, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>wasting
    water, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>cutting timber
    whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>populating remote regions
    whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
      contains the most
      polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
      to sustain its
      uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
      that employ just a few
      people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
      North America. </small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      </small><br>
      <small>We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
      withdraw scarce
      water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
      The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
      artifact of such
      misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
      Colorado is actually
      subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
      the privilege. If they
      paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
      the Treasury, which
      could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
      saving.
      </small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;
      </small><br>
      <small>The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
      asset, our national
      forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
      subsidizing forest roads in
      subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
      in good areas,
      but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
      to get $1 in
      revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
      destroying scenic values
      and watershed protection.
      </small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;
      </small><br>
      <small>Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
      and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.
      </small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid letting lessees of public
      land conceal
      their revenues</span>. Many
      minerals and hydrocarbons on public lands are leased
      by private firms,
      subject either to "royalties" or "severance taxes"
      based on the value of
      output. Many of these private firms are "vertically
      integrated," meaning they
      own the downstream firms, often in other countries,
      to which they sell.
      They grow skilled at shifting profits away from where

      will bless and support you
      for keeping them warm. As society gets better organized,
      though, you can gain by
      guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
      buy fuel and other
      needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
      free fuel that you might be
      exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the

      What does the central bank, the private consortium dubbed the Federal

      Congress (which the Constitution had given to Congress), from no
      savings at all but merely from legal
      standing, it manufactures credit, which the US borrows, at interest.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
      stay rich, some of us can develop
      land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
      especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
      they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
      city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
      than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
      resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
      not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
      -- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
    designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
      our civilization, and our
      eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
      decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
      our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
      to the
      public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
      that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
      and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
      and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
      favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
    automobile.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public,
      governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
      values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
      economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
      stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
      beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
      pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
      Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
      benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
      playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
      taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
    suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>... </strong>    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now wipe out the taxes, subsidies,
      liability limits, and rent
      retention. Instead, replace all that with running government like a

    <p>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
    or Rights-Deprived?</a>    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
      there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
      Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
      But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
      expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
      don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
      privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
      given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
      by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
      of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
      with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
      right.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
      money.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
      protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
      because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
      world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
      keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
      of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small style="font-weight: bold;">
      Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
      and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
      employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
      goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
      taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
      there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
      from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
      costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
      and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
      little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
      To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
      not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
      their right to work and save!</small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small style="font-weight: bold;">
      The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to landowners.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege.<strong>      ... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small style="font-weight: bold;">
      Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the firm has
      a charter from a government.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
      others.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
      who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
      extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
      These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
      not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
      That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
      rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small>      <small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read the whole

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>The Georgist approach to
      taxation had many names: his contemporary
      Thomas Shearman wrote two books calling it the &#8220;natural tax,&#8221; <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span></small>and
      more recently it has been referred to as the &#8220;incentive tax&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small> and
      ground rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
      It should be noted once more that, by whatever name, the &#8220;land tax,&#8221;
&#8220;site value tax,&#8221; or &#8220;single tax&#8221; to George covered a far wider scope
      than simply locational sites, even though today this is the base that
      is given the most attention. It covered any natural factor element that
      humanity chose to put into service. Today, some of these parts of
      nature which have come to be &#8220;owned&#8221; by private corporations (at least
      insofar as their license to such use have become entitlements) are
      worth millions. The electromagnetic spectrum that has been parceled out
      to the communications industry has sometimes been &#8220;auctioned&#8221; for
      one-shot revenue gains, is now for all practical purposes a freehold
      title
      in the hands of those industries.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> Were
      those spectrum bands retained by governments and &#8220;rented,&#8221; the revenue
      would likely be far greater. Whatever increased value now results
    accrues to these private owners instead of to society.</small>    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So also in the case of the
      auctioning of &#8220;pollution credits&#8221; or
      tradeable permits, what in fact constitute the right of power
      industries to treat the air as a dump to the full extent which
      environmental tolerances allow.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span> These
&#8220;credits&#8221; are now &#8220;owned&#8221; by the private sector and traded back and
      forth among corporations, even though all people experience the
      consequences of its treatment. Airport landing slots, &#8220;prime time&#8221;
      broadcasting, and many other time-sensitive dimensions have all been
      handed over to the private sector with nominal benefit to the public.
      London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been a strong supporter of renting the

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The theme of economic justice
      runs throughout Daly&#8217;s work, evident of course in the title For the
      Common Good.122 But the formulations of justice are not explicit. One
      looks in vain for a statement of what if any entitlements people should
      possess by virtue of being human, or what nature or posterity is due in
      turn. Absent is anything that Harvard Law professor Mary Ann Glendon
      calls &#8220;rights talk.&#8221; 123 But it is clear that the ecological economists
      are struggling mightily with these questions. They are boldly posed
      elsewhere in the writing of Joan Martinez-Alier, a Spanish scholar who
      is widely known in the movement not just by his own writing but as
      editor of the journal Ecological Politica. In one article, he sees an
      ever-widening standing for environmental claims, as the environmental
      movement evolves from one based on the efficient and sustainable use of
      natural resources (the &#8220;gospel of eco-efficiency,&#8221; in the tradition of
      Gifford Pinchot), later to the &#8220;cult of wilderness&#8221; (in the tradition
      of John Muir and Aldo Leopold).&#8221; 124 They are evident also in the work
      of Bernardo Aguilar, particularly with reference to north-south trade
      arrangements which essentially exchange natural resources for developed
      nations&#8217; currencies. 125 As people come to understand their
      relationship and dependence upon their natural environment, he
      envisions an unfolding pattern of litigation to preserve the sanctity
      and protection of peoples dependent upon it. Distant corporate
      interests will be blocked from exploiting the lands of local
      populations who are otherwise left with the liabilities of their
      repair.&nbsp; </small>...<small> <a

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We were four college sophomores.
      And we were not going to live in a
      dorm, no sir, we figured that we were smart, mature fellows and so we
      arranged to rent a house. Each person would have his own private
      bedroom and we would share the bathroom. Four guys, one bathroom. That
      sounds reasonable, right?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>But let me tell you about Edward. Nobody wanted to use the
      bathroom
      after Edward, because something would be finished, gone, used up. No
      toilet paper? No soap? Edward somehow seemed always to be the last
      person to use these things. It reduced the value of the bathroom for
    the rest of us, yet we got no compensation. Edward was a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">taker</span>. That felt unfair. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our planet's natural resources are

      <li><small>We see people or corporations like Edward, taking more
    than their
    fair share of oil, fresh water, minerals, without compensating the rest
    of us.</small></li>
      <li><small>We see people or corporations like Charlie, polluting the
    land,
    water and air with toxic wastes, chemicals, carbon in the atmosphere,
    making the world less safe, forcing others to clean up, and they are
    not compensating the rest of us.</small></li>
      <li><small>We see people or corporations like Andrew, monopolizing
    resources
    such as land -&#8211; an urban land speculator who holds an acre out of use,
    anticipating a price rise, is displacing the rest of us, forcing
    development out into the countryside. A single acre of downtown land
    brought into use would save a dozen outside acres from premature sprawl
    development.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who take, monopolize, and
      pollute, are imposing costs on the rest

      monopolizers and polluters can benefit. That is not fair.</small><br>

        3.0 &#8212; Chapter 5: Reinventing the Commons (pages 65-78)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Property rights are useful human inventions. They&#8217;re legally enforceable
        agreements through which society grants specific privileges to owners.
        Among these are rights to use, exclude, sell, rent, lend, trade, or bequeath
        a particular asset. These assorted privileges can be bundled or unbundled
        almost any which way.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s largely through property rights that economies are shaped.
        Feudal economies were based on estates passed from lords to their eldest
        sons, alongside commons that sustained the commoners. Commoners were
        required, in one way or another, to labor for the lords, while the lords
        lived off that labor and the bounty of the land. The whole edifice was
        anchored by the so-called divine right of kings.</p>
      <p>Similarly, capitalism is shaped by the property rights we create and
        honor today. Its greatest invention has been the web of property rights
        we call the <em>joint stock corporation</em>. This fictitious entity
        enjoys perpetual life, limited liability, and &#8212; like the feudal
        estate of yesteryear &#8212; almost total sovereignty. Its beneficial
        ownership has been fractionalized into tradeable shares, which themselves
        are a species of property.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires
        them to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example,
        set up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of
        future generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares
        of Pacific Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to
        preserve the forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned
        some of these rights, Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s)
        would have ended more happily. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
        3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The California drivers&#8217; handbook states: &#8220;At an intersection,
        yield to the car which arrives first or to the car on your right if it
        reaches the intersection at the same time you do.&#8221; (I discovered
        this when my teenage son took his driving test.)</p>
      <p>Why does the car on the right get priority over the car on the left?
        It&#8217;s unclear. Quite possibly the rule is entirely arbitrary. But
        someone has to have the right of way or cars will collide. The same is
        true for boats at sea, and for moving objects in any complex system.</p>
      <p>So too in a market economy. When two property rights come to the same
        intersection, one has to trump the other. Either capital can fire labor,
        or labor can fire capital. Either my right to pollute trumps your right
        not to be polluted, or vice versa. As they say in Hollywood, someone
        must get top billing.</p>
      <p>But who? Marjorie Kelly has written a brilliant book called <strong><em>The
          Divine Right of Capital</em></strong>. By divine she doesn&#8217;t mean God-given. She means
        that, under our current operating system, the rights of capital trump
        everything else. The rights of workers, communities, nature, and future
        generations &#8212; all play second fiddle to capital&#8217;s prerogative
        to maximize short-term gain. This hierarchy isn&#8217;t the doing of
        God or some inexorable law of nature. Rather, it&#8217;s a result of
        political choice.</p>
      <p>The question of who gets the top right in any society is always an interesting
        one. Invariably, the top dogs in any era assert that there&#8217;s no
        alternative. Kings said it three hundred years ago; capital owners say
        it today. They hire priests and economists to add moral or pseudoscientific
        credence to their claims. The truth, though, is that societies choose
        their top right holders, and we can change our minds if we wish.</p>
      <p>Kelly locates many places where capital&#8217;s supremacy is written
        into our codes. Corporate directors, for example, are bound by law to
        put shareholders&#8217; financial gain first. If a raider offers a higher
        price for a publicly traded company than its current market value, directors
        have little choice but to sell, regardless of the consequences for workers,
        communities, or nature. Similarly, it&#8217;s the fiduciary duty of mutual
        funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors to seek the highest
        returns for their shareholders or beneficiaries. This duty is embodied,
        among other places, in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
        1974. Although the language of the act sounds innocent enough &#8212; a
        pension fund manager, like any trustee, &#8220;shall discharge his duties
        . . . solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries&#8221; &#8212; it
        results, ironically, in the financing of many workers&#8217; retirements
        by investing in companies that shift other workers&#8217; jobs overseas.
        Throw in the WTO and NAFTA, and the rights of capital stand comfortably
        astride everyone else&#8217;s.</p>
      <p>What&#8217;s wrong here? It&#8217;s not that businesses pursue profit;
        that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re designed to do and what we want them
        to do. The problem is that private capital rides in the front of the
        bus while everyone else rides in the back.</p>
      <p>At the moment, there&#8217;s one law that does give preference to creation&#8217;s
        gifts: the Endangered Species Act, which says a species&#8217; right
        to survive trumps capital&#8217;s right to short-term gain. The trouble
        is, the law comes into play only when a species has been so devastated
        it&#8217;s on the brink of extinction. Even then, the courts don&#8217;t
        always enforce it. Recently, in a very dry year, the government reduced
        its delivery of subsidized water to California farmers because endangered
        fish needed it to survive. Some farmers sued, arguing that the government
        had unconstitutionally &#8220;taken&#8221; their property. A federal
        court agreed, the Bush administration refused to appeal, and the farmers
        collected $13 million in damages.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that, if anything is divine, it should be gifts of creation.
        Morally, they&#8217;re gifts we inherit together and must pass on, undiminished,
        to future generations. Economically, they&#8217;re irreplaceable and
        invaluable capital. Protection of these shared assets should trump transient
        private gain. Broad benefit should trump narrow benefit. The commons
        should trump capital. This should be written into our economic operating
        system and enforced by the courts. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
