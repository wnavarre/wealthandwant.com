      Value Taxation</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>... Not all revenue
collection on the part of government is grounded in
the
constitutional authority of its tax powers. Taxes in the strictest
sense of the term are revenues involuntarily paid to general funds for
the general purposes of government. But there are many other revenues
paid to government that would never be construed as taxes: lottery
revenues, fines, interest payments, environmental (green) fees, payment
for information, and user fees being the most common examples. Fines,
green fees, and user fees are instruments of police power precisely
because their primary purpose is to correct behavior, and only
secondarily to raise revenue. User fees, along with environmental fees
particularly, are employed to recover the costs of use, wear or damage
to environmental or government-provided "services." (Only in recent
years has it been fashionable to regard use or degradation of the
natural environment as a "service," necessitating "correction," as was
originally explicated by Pigou earlier this century.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Fiscal measures such as those noted above can be employed under
police
powers to correct, or at least compensate for, otherwise egregious
social behavior, and public policy makers must concern themselves with
the question whether such measures are more or less appropriate or
effective. These provide an attractive alternative to what have come to
be known as "command and control" approaches. Just as are so many
fiscal measures, command-and-control approaches to regulating and
controlling social and economic behavior is also grounded in the police
powers of government. Administrative theory has grown in appreciation
for fiscal approaches and away from command-and-control approaches in
recent years.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small>
This is because they are often far less expensive and more efficient to
implement, easier to understand, have a greater degree of compliance,
and has the added virtue, lastly, of raising revenue for the support of
governmental responsibilities. This interest in "tax shifting" has
inspired the slogan, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax

These pricing approaches taken together offer the prospect of both
recovering costs in their varied forms as well as fostering efficient
transportation services. There are grave misconception in how much
fiscal policies distort social and economic behavior. And the fiscal
policies that foster the greatest distortions of all are those
involving road costs and the failure to collect economic rent. Rather
than resort to traditional command-and-control approaches which are
frequently just as cumbersome and distorting as current unthinking
fiscal measures, now is an opportune time to consider models which will

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The
answers being offered, however, don&#8217;t address the root causes of the
problem. The most talked about panacea is the institution of urban
growth boundaries, but these have failed to be demonstrably successful
even in the two communities most often cited (Portland and Boulder)
where they were instituted over twenty years ago.<small><small><small>
Recent days have witnessed a profound and growing awareness of the
problems due to sprawl development. In fact one opinion poll marked
sprawl as the highest current concern among American voters.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">60</span></small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">61</span></small>
Solutions such as these reflect the penchant of policy makers to rely
upon so-called &#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC) approaches to government
rather than &#8220;pricing&#8221; approaches. The extension of government reach and
weight to impose policies deemed appropriate is burdensome, expensive,
and inefficient. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Daly and Cobb outline eight issues relating to the ecological
economics
perspective which call for clear public policy changes in their view.
All relate to the American context: economic globalization, population,
land use, agriculture, industry, labor, income policies and taxes, and
national security policy. Put differently, there is no realm of policy
outside of the reach of ecological economics; this is what makes it
truly interdisciplinary. The second book focuses more directly on means
by which to preserve natural capital, using what means governments have
at their disposal. After first distinguishing between <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC)</span> and
incentive pricing systems, the authors continue by exploring the
various ways that the latter, fiscal measures, can be engaged to alter
the course of current economic practices in favor of more sound and
environmentally sensitive ones. No short treatment can do justice to
each class of proposals, but a quick summary indicates their general
direction. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Underlying the whole agenda is a commitment beyond simple
description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. It presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units. It recognizes that governments must take a hand in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<small><span

<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>119One oft-cited article
is that
of Peter Vitousek, et al,
&#8220;Human Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,&#8221; BioScience,
Vol. 36, No.6 (1986), pp. 368-373, available at
http://dieoff.org/page83.htm. It calculates that consumption of earth&#8217;s
resources is doubles at an ever increasing rate, and that humans have
already appropriated 40% of terrestrial biological productivity. The
most comprehensive collection of articles addressing this perspective
is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at
www.dieoff.org. The site name arises from his view that the world
economy&#8217;s dependence upon fossil fuels faces an imminent end, and the
earth will then be capable of supporting only about two billion people.
Hence a looming dieoff. 
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental
challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage
and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, in instances where incentives require altered
behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes, sometimes also
called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS OF SYNTHESIS OF GEORGIST
AND
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS</span></small><br>
<small>The commonalities of Georgist economics and ecological economics
appear
to be organizable into six general points: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) preservation of the commons, <br>
2) sustainable development, <br>
3) appropriate valuation of natural capital, <br>
4) ensuring social and biological community, <br>
5) fostering individual self-realization, and <br>
6) securing economic justice. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all these points is
the view that market activity needs to
be circumscribed and juxtaposed to the non-human, biological realm. It
appears that there is lots to be gained by some synthesis of the two
fields of discourse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ecological economists worry about the encroachment, and even the
elimination, of those elements of nature to which private property
title has not been granted. In their concern about the need to protect
the &#8220;commons,&#8221; they are torn between the view that only through
privatization can all the world&#8217;s assets be preserved and the
alternative view that any private appropriation of the commons
constitutes a moral compromise. They fear a repeat of Garrett Hardin&#8217;s
&#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221; Their argument often proposed is rather
complex to explicate: it assumes that private property titles may
perhaps provide the best incentive not to exploit the fruits of the
earth and the earth itself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">126</span></small> To
Georgists, on the other hand, the earth and all its resources are
already in fact the birthright of all humanity; individuals are
entitled to its use in return for the payment of rents. Further
privatization is anathema. The key rather is in distinguishing the
various components of ownership and getting prices right &#8212; mainly in
the
collection of economic rents.</small><br>
<br>
<small>One must ask then whether there is some such means by which to
accomplish the goal of environmental preservation &#8212; through either of
the means by which government has at its disposal: command-and-control
(CAC) approaches or pricing approaches. It has already been noted how
difficult CAC approaches are to enforce, and how expensive they are
both in terms of administration and economic inefficiencies. Pricing on
the other hand suffers from the difficult challenge of getting it
&#8220;right,&#8221; som ething which typically must be resolved through formal
public decisions, especially when and insofar as they involve public
goods or common property.... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Command-and-Control Measures</strong></p>
  <p> Policymakers have two modes of leverage by which to implement public will:
      1) so-called command-and-control approaches that are typically enforced
    by what state and federal constitutions group under &quot;police powers&quot; and
      2) fiscal approaches that typically involve a variety of taxes, fees, fines,
      and other charges that derive constitutionally from either police powers or &quot;tax
      powers.&quot; When governments administer either of these powers, they
      are legitimate and authoritative. Fiscal measures available to governments
      can
      come from either ground. The charges that the private sector usually impose
      differ in that they usually are responsive to market forces. Prices that
      are established by government, however, are not necessarily responsive
      to market
      forces, nor are they intended to be. Rather, they are set in order to accomplish
      specific public policy goals.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19] </em></strong></font>They
      can be no less efficient, however, when responsibly instituted.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. One recent exploration of this is a chapter titled &quot;Catalytic
            Government: Steering Rather Than Rowing,&quot; in Reinventing Government:
            How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Public Sector, ed. David
            Osborne and Ted Gaebler (New York: Penguin, 1993). </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Governments face the challenge of knowing which of the tools at their disposal &#8212; command-and-control
      approaches or &quot;pricing&quot; approaches &#8212; will best serve effective
      and efficient achievement of public policies. Only in recent years, however,
      has there been a renewed interest in fiscal levers to achieve goals that policymakers
      seek to achieve. There is particular interest among students of welfare economics
      in incorporating costs earlier regarded as externalities, especially in designing
      environmental policies. Moreover, the use of pricing approaches to recover
      costs of government services that have a high level of private good about them
      can bring about more attractive and achievable goals than reliance on conventional
      police power approaches. User fees, environmental fees, and other such fiscal
      tools have become more fascinating &#8212; at least to students of public policy &#8212; than
      conventional taxes.</p>
  <p>The renewed interest in fiscal approaches comes in recognition of the fact
      that traditional command-and-control approaches have not been successful. Government
      authority is far more effective at prohibiting and controlling than it is inducing
      and channeling.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> Three

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Likewise, there are at least two
kinds of containment policies for
urban sprawl.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One says <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop! Thou
shalt not </span>settle
outside the designated growth boundary, neither shalt thou build, nor
manufacture, nor trade, nor store goods, nor park vehicles, nor disport
thyself in other than traditional country-squire-like amusements. I
shall call this a "negative containment policy."</small></li>
  <li><small>The other policy says Go!, or rather <b>Come! Come into
my city
and rebuild it</b>. This is not "development" in the modern pejorative
sense of territorial expansion. Rather it is REdevelopment in the
manner of the phoenix - the mythical bird, that is, not the city
misnamed Phoenix, which is an awful example of mindless lateral
expansion without renewal.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider Philadelphia, once the
City of Brotherly Love founded
by an idealistic English Quaker. Today, after 3 centuries of
development, Philadelphia has 15,800 vacant lots, but that only
begins the story. It has 27,000 empty houses (i.e. junkers on usable
lots that might as well be vacant); 1500 acres of vacant land and
brownfields; and 700 vacant commercial bldgs.</b> A local journalist
names it BlightTown, U.S.A. If he travelled a bit he'd find it is
only one of many.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result of decay without
renewal is to threaten the
countryside; settlers spill out, "like ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing." Yet, these are not ghosts, nor autumn leaves in the west
wind; these are live people. Destroy man's habitat here and he moves
it there, and takes habitat from other life forms. The solutions to
urban decay and disintegration are infilling and renewal. Here is
where the Green Light Tax is such a good management tool. It lets
cities rebuild themselves without tax penalties on new building, and
rise like the phoenix from their own ashes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a reflex against growth
and development we must learn to
overcome. "Growth" should not be an issue to divide us: it depends on
the kind of growth. Resentment of growth and development stems in
large part from associating them with territorial expansion.
Infilling and renewal and rehab, however, UNCOUPLE growth from
sprawl: they let cities grow (or at least stop shrinking) without
sprawling. Ascending to a satellite view, let's look at the whole
system of settlement: focusing people where they should be keeps them
away from where they shouldn't be.</small></p>

the lowest property tax rate in the U.S. Albuquerque sprawls out
about 30 miles east-west, and another 30 miles north-south, giving a
density of about 300-400 people per square mile for its 330,000
residents. Many of its homes are slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Contrast that with the aerial view
of Sydney, Australia, a city
that raises a lot of its budget from "Green Light" taxes on site
value. Sydney and suburbs have nearly 3 million people, on less land
than Albuquerque, and with no slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is plenty of land to go
around.</b> The pleasant green
villages of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin are upper-income
Milwaukee suburbs that feature detached homes on tree-lined streets,
with detached garages, laws against overnight curb parking, a number
of lakeshore mansions with parklike grounds, ample public parks, good
shopping, and a little industry. Their densities are 10,000 persons
per square mile. At this density, 250 million Americans would fit
nicely into less than half of Wisconsin, an average-sized one of 50
states. (They would occupy 0.7% of the United States.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the 10,000 density, Greater
Milwaukee would fit inside
Milwaukee County, yet it now sprawls out over several counties. It
sprawls farther yet if one counts the rural residents who float in
and out of town for seasonal work. Shorewood and Whitefish Bay have
high density because they are the only Milwaukee suburbs with no
vacant land; the others, and the central city itself, are full of
holes. <b>Result: sprawl, invasion of wildlands, loss of farmland,
forced automobilization of former pedestrians, water pollution from
new grading - the whole litany of green laments. High density is not
their cause, but their cure.&nbsp; </b>... <a

Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real Libertarian,
or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The red, red herring</b></small> <br>
    <small>Royal libertarians are fond of confusing the classical liberal concept
    of common land ownership, particularly as espoused by land value tax advocate
    Henry George, with socialism. Yet socialists have always been contemptuous
    of George and of the distinction between land monopoly and capital monopolies.
    However, Frank Chodorov and Albert J. Nock (the original editors of <em>The
    Freeman</em>) were both advocates of George's economic remedies as well as
    lovers of individual liberty.</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>The only reformer abroad in
      the world in my time who interested me in the least was Henry George, because
      his project did not contemplate prescription, but, on the contrary, would
      reduce it to almost zero. He was the only one of the lot who believed in
      freedom, or (as far as I could see) had any approximation to an intelligent
      idea of what freedom is, and of the economic prerequisites to attaining
      it....One is immensely tickled to see how things are coming out nowadays
      with reference to his doctrine, <strong>for George was in fact the best
      friend the capitalist ever had</strong>. He built up the most complete
      and most impregnable defense of the rights of capital that was ever constructed,
      and if the capitalists of his day had had sense enough to dig in behind
      it, their successors would not now be squirming under the merciless exactions
      which collectivism is laying on them, and which George would have no scruples
      whatever about describing as sheer highwaymanry.</i> &#8212;Albert J. Nock "Thoughts
      on Utopia"&nbsp; ... <a
