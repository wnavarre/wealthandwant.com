<p>Everett Gross: <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">Explaining Rent</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
      an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
      word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He
        needs a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this
      new building on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he
      wants, and the real
        estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this land?" The agent
        says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth $50,000?" And the
        real estate agent points out that "The school is good, the roads are
        good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good and very
        fast, and business
        is good here."
      </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
          take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
          and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real estate
          agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the person
          who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
          and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
          build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me for
          my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
          at all!&quot;</p>

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>A simple model will serve to illustrate. Presently, rail/metro
infrastructure is almost prohibitively expensive because the windfall
benefits are effectively handed over to landowners. To partially recoup
the outlay, authorities are forced to set fares so high as to act as a
disincentive to potential low-impact commuters.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Enter LVT. Land values enhanced by the infrastructure are
"recycled" by
LVT back into the public purse. This enables fares to be reduced, which
makes the adjacent land more valuable because it now has access to
cheaper public transport. These resulting enhanced land values are
again recycled back to the community coffers, which again allows low
fares which allow more recycled enhanced land values, which allow lower
fares which allow..... While illustrating the process, in practice such
iterations would be bypassed as authorities would cut to the chase and
set the most economically and environmentally desirable fare structure,
which equals the marginal cost of traveling, and not have to dig into
scarce public funds to finance such projects. ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;If taxation is unnecessary, what is to take its place? Government and
    its functions are increasingly expensive. They require a lot of money. Where
    is it to come from?&quot; The answer may be placed in the form of a second
    proposition:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village, city,
          state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing income,
          growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
          governmental
          expenditure.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To explain: <strong>Every community has an indefeasible original right to
      the land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties
      and advantages
    of that particular area of the earth's surface. </strong>To this land in its natural
    state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
    its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
    (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
    all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
    society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
    descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
    the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
    ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
    holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
    wrong party. <strong>The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
    unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
    for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
    above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</strong></p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
    advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
    and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
    to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
    taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
        One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to use it.
        Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability to
        control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from the
      increase in its price. With most of the geo-rent tapped for public revenue,
      the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the economy, since
      with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land would instead go
      to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide better training.</p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If a
      landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to pass
      on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would be invisible
      to renters, the link between using public services and paying for them would
      be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent, so that link
      is there. If government revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not generate
      rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce land
      value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue would come from the
      landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no different than the situation
      today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no property tax, and typically
      they get government assistance. This is an argument not against the use of
      rent, but in favor of privatizing government programs. In the private sector,
      the link between ownership and control is stronger. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
      Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small> With first Spanish and then Mexican control,
much California land had been <i>pueblo,</i>
or public. Though very little of that pueblo land remains, some of it
is still quite valuable. In the 1960s, various towns sitting on San
Diego Bay designated their water fronts as the Port District. The Port
Authority collects hundreds of millions of dollars of land rents each
year and is one of few local government agencies with a consistently
positive cash flow. Where does that cash flow to? While not into any
bloated bank accounts of private owners, by law it can not flow back to
the "pueblo." Instead, it must be spent by the Port Authority who tend
to take numerous trade missions to exotic destinations and redecorate
their offices each year. ... <br>
<br>
Land that is higher taxed is lower
priced.
Cheaper land reduces buyers' debt. Less demand for loans lowers the
lending rate. Cheaper capital means more investment and more
employment. In Australia, in the province around Melbourne, some towns
levy the regular property tax, others tax only land. Those with the
same rate for sites and structures suffer more bankruptcies; those with
one rate for land enjoy more successful business start-ups.<br>
<br>
The PTS encourages investing in high-yield use of parcels.
Developing land generates jobs in construction. As those construction
workers spend their incomes, they generate more business for local
merchants. For the few years that New York exempted buildings in the
1920s, the city boomed more than any other US city. In New Zealand,
over 80% of the towns tax land, not buildings. Before the 70's oil
shock hit, they enjoyed over a decade of employment at 99%.<br>
<br>
A stable source of revenue is a virtue in the eyes of any government.
When recession strikes, governments that tax income or property must
borrow more to make ends meet. The disincentives built into ordinary
taxes deepen and prolong the recession. When taxes upon effort are
eased, the economies can recover.<br>
<br>
The PTS can cure local recessions. Spurring building, while not
burdening it, keeps a web of regional suppliers, installers,
architects, financiers, and others in greater demand.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><b><br>
</b></small></font><strong><br>
<font size="3"><small>Not only is the PTS efficient, it is also
fair. For ages, people have debated the just basis for taxation:
ability to pay versus benefits received. The property tax shift settles
the argument in favor of both sides. </small></font></strong><font size="3"><small><br>
</small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>First,
land "dues" (taxes, fees,
liturgy, or some combination of the forgoing), especially when coupled
with an untaxing of homes, jobs, and enterprises, are inherently
progressive. <br>
Second, land dues are scaled according to site values.
Site values measure not what an owner puts into the "common kitty" but
what one takes out. A prime location has the most advantages; it's the
one enjoying the best that society and nature have to offer. For owners
to enjoy those locations exclusively, and to pay more for doing so, is
exquisitely just.</small></font>
</small></div>
<small><font size="3"><small><br>
Eventho' almost everyone would worry about paying more tax, the PTS is
inherently progressive. Studies of the towns in Pennsylvania that have
shifted some tax from buildings to land show that about 75% come out
ahead (nearly the entire bottom four quintiles of income earners), 20%
break even and 5% pay more (together a bit larger than the top quintile
of income recipients), who are usually absentee owners.<b><br>
</b><br>
First-time home buyers make out like bandits. They'd pay a higher
land dues to their community but lower total taxes to government, a
lower price to the seller, and a lower mortgage to the lender. Is it
fair that one group should benefit so prodigiously? Yes. In many US
cities, renters now outnumber owners. High rates of tenancy, as shown
in Goldschmidt's 1940s study of the Central California towns Arvin and
Dinuba, engender apathy and indifference, which are bad for democracy,
community involvement, street safety, and environmental protection. The
sooner young families can become homeowners, the better off all members
of society will be.<br>
<br>
Presently, when land prices rise (or the land tax), owners charge more
to buyers and renters. After a PTS, the higher rate on land makes
owners eager for customers. Plus, there'd be more owners in
competition, as former speculators become new developers. Thus the PTS
stabilize prices, saving money for small businesses and those in the
lower income brackets.<strong> ... </strong><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>What's won or lost is a value
generated by
society. That is, land rises in value 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where a new resource is
discovered (during a gold rush, more money is made by land developers
than by prospectors), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where population grows (see the Sun
Belt and
verdant Northwest), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where technology advances (witness
the land values
in the various Silicon Valleys, Forests, etc), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where infrastructure
expands (e.g., near a new road or sewer), and 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where society cooperates
(e.g., in communities that organize street fairs, neighborhood watches,
etc). 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>These factors driving land value are not
improvements made by
lone owners but by the entire community. The closest correlation to
land value is density and no one person creates that. Hence the site
value levy merely puts public values in the public treasury for public
benefit, as untaxing homes, sales, and income leaves
privately-generated values in private pockets.<strong> ... </strong></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>While beneficiaries have a hard time envisioning
their gains, losers
have an easy time calculating their losses. The big loser is not
homeowners; while losing equity, they keep all earnings untaxed. Nor is
it realtors, while losing their few big sales, they gain many smaller
ones. Nor is it developers; while paying higher infrastructure fees,
they'd pay less for prime land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No,
the big losers would be banks who'd
have to readjust to pre-World War II levels of lending rates</span>. As
they
probably won't want to give up their unearned income, advocates of PTS
will need to use moral arguments (as in the struggle against slavery)
to gain public support and use practical arguments to pry realtors,
developers, service businesses, and small businesses aside, thereby
isolating lenders.<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a
