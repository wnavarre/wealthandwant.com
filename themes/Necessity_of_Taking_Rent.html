    <p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
      have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought about
      under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth. It
      is the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes
      a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth. Let
      us work by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against it,
      it is hard pulling and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take some
rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.*</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar
          with economic terminology may assume, the whole amount paid for the
          use of real estate. It is only that part of such amount which is paid
          for the use of the bare land or site employed, exclusive of the payment
          for the use of any buildings or other improvements on it. H. G. B.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
      need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount
      of land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes,
      land, no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held,
      would be really common property, and every member of the community would
      participate in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
    <p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily
      be increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition
      into practical form by proposing --</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land
          values.</em></strong></p>
    <p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
      but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of
      the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country, even
      the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear
      the entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries it
      is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place
      all taxes upon the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds
      the present governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount
      demanded in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses
      and rent advances. But this is so natural and easy a matter, that it may
      be considered as involved, or at least understood, in the proposition to
      put all taxes on the value of land. That is the first step upon which the
      practical struggle must be made. When the hare is once caught and killed,
      cooking him will follow as a matter of course. When the common right to
      land is so far appreciated that all taxes are abolished save those which
      fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more than is necessary to induce
      them to collect the public revenues being left to individual landholders.</p>
    <p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds
      lodgment sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but
      there are few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first,
      or even for a long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is a
        real antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over
        the idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly to
        tax them.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
        capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
        poorer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
      there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature,
      education, and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong
      which in every civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty
      and want, will not die without a bitter struggle. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/07_Simplicity_Introducing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> This is the secret which would transform the little village into the
      great city.*</li>
    <li> With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
          the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed
      of.</li>
    <li> This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212; a
          new surplus which society might take for general purposes.</li>
    <li> And released from the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue
          in a way that begets corruption and renders legislation the tool of
      special interests, society could assume functions which the increasing
      complexity
          of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
          demoralization under the present system now leads thoughtful men to
      shrink from.
        <p><font size="-1">*At the beginning of <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Book
                IX </a>of the complete Progress &amp; Poverty, Henry George quotes
                from Themistocles: &quot;I cannot play upon any stringed instrument,
                but I can tell you how of a little village to make a great and
                glorious city.&quot; </font></p>

  </ul>
  <p>... Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
    him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his
    labor,
  and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
  and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
  And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
  and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
  labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
  this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the
    value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
    of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
    one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from
    use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its
    death blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions
    of acres from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned
    by their present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this
    not merely on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled
    districts.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
        be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
        economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
        The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
        of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging
        all the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value
        of land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
        to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of
        such a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
        land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition
        of former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land
        cheaper to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent
        remaining after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value,
        land will be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
    land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as
    agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep
    land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for
    it than the use to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere
    that land had attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as
    a fine upon improvement, would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted
    an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory,
    no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept
    so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
      of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his neighbor
      who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
      land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great warehouses
      filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid
    before labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
      a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
      a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
      of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
            have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this
            point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the
            greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is
            trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for,
            it is said, the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset
            the lower purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that
            even if the lower price of land does no more than balance the higher
            tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement
            to speculation in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes
            is all clear gain. It is easier to save in proportion as earnings
            and commodities are relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land,
            because its selling price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although
            the land, after its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can
            this tax be fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in
            the purchase price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in
            taxes on buildings and other improvements and in whatever other taxes
            are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to
    the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for
    laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the
    labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment
    of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
    demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
    against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
    profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
    upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
    monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
    <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
    <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
      hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to
me, through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Just as society grows, so do the
common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Nay,
here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; </span>... <a

MAN is driven by his instincts and needs to form society. Society, thus formed,
has certain needs and functions for which revenue is required. These needs and
functions increase with social development, requiring a larger and larger revenue.
Now, experience and analogy, if not the instinctive perceptions of the human
mind, teach us that there is a natural way of satisfying every natural want.
And if human society is included in nature, as it surely is, this must apply
to social wants as well as to the wants of the individual, and there must be
a natural or right method of taxation, as there is a natural or right method
of walking. &#8212;<em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
    lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
    out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
    reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
    reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
    one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
    bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
    it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
    his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
    to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
    are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
    fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
    field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
    a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
    a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
    direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like the squirrel who buries
    his nuts and refrains from digging them up again. Lo! they sprout and grow
    into trees. In fine linen, steeped in costly spices, the mummy is laid away.

  <p>CONSIDER the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to
    the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for
    laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the
    labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment
    of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
    demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
    against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
    profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
    upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
    monopolization. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>
  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

        George's proposition is in any respect unjust, will find profit in a

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed

  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>
  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>

        of the absurdity of such an ownership. The idea of owning air was ridiculous;
        the idea of owning land was not. Yet who can explain the difference,
        except as a matter of custom?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">To the same effect was the question of the Rev. F. L.
        Higgins to a friend. While stationed at Galveston, Tex., Mr. Higgins
        fell into a discussion with his friend as to the right of government
        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Suppose,&quot; said Mr. Higgins, &quot;that the
        government should vest in a corporation title to the Gulf of Mexico,
        so that no one could fish there, or sail there, or do anything in or
        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.
        Would that be right?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, suppose the corporation should then parcel
        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Could private titles to the Gulf possibly become
        absolute in morals?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then tell me,&quot; asked Mr. Higgins, &quot;what
        difference it would make if all the water were taken off the Gulf and
        only the bare land left.&quot;</font></p>

  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single
    Tax. 110</p>

        that pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the

        for others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that
        it is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be handled
        sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent that
        they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of
        alcohol, which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
        electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
        make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
        is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
        he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they increase
        publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not covered
        by user charges.</small> </p>

          to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements).
          He pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes
          to may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax
          is that it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment,
          and to identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public

  <p align="left"><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
        of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be collected

        these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to finance necessary
        public expenditures, then the least damaging additional tax would probably
        be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on all residents. If some residents
        are regarded to be incapable of paying such a tax, then the next most
        efficient tax is a proportional tax on income up to some specified amount.
        Then there is no disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax
        limit. The next most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
  <p align="left"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not
        to tax the profits of corporations</span>. Capital moves from where it
        is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate of return is earned
        everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing corporations they will invest
        more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be higher, and the rent of land, collected
        by the government, will be higher. The least damaging tax on corporations
        is one that provides a complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over
        of tax credits to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the
        government a partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
        provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
        receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive for
        entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when investment is
        expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such a tax requires
        that everyone believe that the tax rate will never change. Thus it is
        best
        not to tax the profits of corporations at all. If the people of
        St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of corporations, then they
        should invest directly in the corporations, either privately or publicly.
        The residents of St. Petersburg would be best served by refraining from
        taxing the profits of corporations. Creating a place where profits are
        not taxed can be expected to attract so much capital that the resulting
        rises in wages and in government-collected rents will more than offset
        what might have been collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
  <p align="left"><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one
      of two features. </small></p>
  <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among competing

          spectrum and for depleting natural resources share this feature. <br>
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the person who
          pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on pollution, taxes on
          other activities that reduce the value of surrounding land, taxes on
          imposing congestion and other costs on other residents of the city,
          charges for the marginal cost of publicly provided services, and a
          self-assessed tax on property, reflecting the hindrance to future growth
          represented by existing development. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to attract capital
    rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth, raising the wages of its
    citizens and the publicly-collected rent of its land.</small>...<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

<blockquote>
  <p>Any moves to enact good government principles without collecting
    the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
    guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
    doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
    long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
    full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
    out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
    as public revenue. ...</p>
  <p>Adam Smith, in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, suggested that any "tax" should
    be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more efficiently
    performed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
    four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
    meet:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Light on the production of wealth, and does not impede
      or reduce production; <br>
      2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
      understand; <br>
      3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for corruption,
      and provides adequate revenue; <br>
      4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received, impartial,
      and just. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Collecting public revenue from land rent is the only revenue
    source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</p>
  <p>While the major argument for raising public revenue from land rent
    and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
    the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
    public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
    its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
    Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
    options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
    goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
    and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
    hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
    take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
    present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
    States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
    public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
    same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
    building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
    tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
    and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
    30% in recent years.</p>
  <p>As new inventions and more efficient ways of producing goods are
    discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
    they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span></small> Instead of
    rent being used to provide community services, capital and wages must be
    depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</p>
  <p>When the rent of land is taken for public purposes production and
    distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
    rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
    rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
    is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
    rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
    increasing productivity by more than 25%. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)<br>
    <br>
    </span></small><b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
    SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b>
  </p>
  <p>In order to preserve the environment, it is necessary and possible
    to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
    market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
    someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
    contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
    some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
    all of the market rent of land.</p>
  <p>Studies have been produced that demonstrate that communities
    prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
    that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
    of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
    all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
    regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
    and industry and become prosperous.</p>
  <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To determine how much
    land rent the community should collect
    let's consider the alternatives.</span> Whatever is not collected will
    be
    capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
    market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
    capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
    the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
    disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
    5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
    farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
    values.</b></p>
  <p>People will come to a well run community because they will be
    better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
    city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
    services.</p>
  <p>This revenue can best be procured when the community recaptures
    the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
    by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
    the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
    belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
    produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
    rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
    of, and provided by, the local city government</p>
  <p>Cities which choose to collect land rent as their primary source
    of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
    paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
    Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
    they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
    consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
    produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
    results.</p>
  <p>Each person has a right to keep what he or she produces, but no
    one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
    includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
    opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
    as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
    users are willing to pay.</p>
  <p>If the value of land rent exceeds the community's needs for public
    services a method of dispensing of the revenue can easily be
    found. To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has special
    benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
    the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
    services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
    roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
    emergencies.</p>
  <p>An ethical proposal might be to then divide the excess revenue
    that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
    each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
    the remaining revenue. This is similar to the method used in Alaska
    and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
    accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
    ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</p>
  <p>Not only is land rent potentially an important source of public
    revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
    to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
    fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
    land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
    were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
    services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
    collect the market rent of land.</p>
  <p>The value of land can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy, at
        a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
        proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
        proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
        the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
        maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
        major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
        use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
        dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
        Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
        nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
        responsibility of good government.

  <blockquote>
    <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
      sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or
      two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to
      the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in
      land. American cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at
      least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of
      total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers
      reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
      because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market
      price from the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive
      market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a
      penalty on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their
      maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden
      would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for
      their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
      challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
      particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes,
      evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated
      with administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve
      disputes over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
    <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles.
      Locations are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are
      improved or not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others
      elsewhere,32 a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles
      of sound tax theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however,
      when looking at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
      The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
      as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
      the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
      of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
      data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
      of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
      allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
      Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
      reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
      easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
      features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through
      local or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas
      of greatest market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can
      easily be taxed in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a
      stock. Just as income is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and
      should) be understood as such.</p>
    <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
      what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
      than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
      since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
      human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to
      land. Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic
      location for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use.
      Regardless whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the
      full extent of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate
      with their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century
      ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without
      working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising
      as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the
      community and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent
      its recovery by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to
      opportunistically situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected
      rental value is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching
      a market price and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the
      recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the
      failure to recover the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary
      to tax productive activities in our economy, and this leads to economic
      and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It
      means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
    <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production
      not created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or

        Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
        upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
        We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
        which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children
        of men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
        contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society
        must adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry
        George did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought
        and diction which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
    <p>... First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these
        rights may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction
        between what is justly private property because it has relation to individual
        initiative and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property
        because it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose
        value is created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some
        governmental privilege or franchise.</p>
    <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should be
        abolished as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly
        for private monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact that
        even where a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated in the
        public interests, it should be operated as a result of cooperation between
        the representatives of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by the politicians
        who control the political state.</p>
    <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created and
        perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish monopoly,
        they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot grant the
        privileges which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences by invoking
        anti-trust laws against them.</p>
    <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions
      which it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting a
      vital function
        which it should and can perform &#8212; the function of collecting public
        revenues, as far as possible, from those who reap the benefits of natural
        resources. In view of public and social needs, it is remarkable that
        no effort has been made by governments to reduce the tax burdens on labor
        and capital,
        which are engaged in increasing production, by transferring them to those
        who restrict production by making monopoly privileges special to themselves.</p>
    <p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
        forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value,
        is a task within the competency of government if it really desires to accomplish
        it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Henry George&#8217;s Solution: Taxing the Flow of Land Rent</p>
    <p>If land values are really the present values of anticipated future ground
      rents, one can certainly treat them as flows rather than stocks, just as
      community services are continuous flows. The amount of rent flowing through
      a site and through the economy is not negligible; what estimates have been
      made, where indeed the economic data allow it to be made, suggest that
      it is roughly a third of a nation&#8217;s GDP.29 The question is whether
      it makes more sense to. Should we elect to continue property tax regimes
      as we do, it would make better sense to tax buildings as stocks and lands
      as rent flows. But this raises the question whether real property should
      be exempt from all taxes, as some have argued.30 What rationale exists
      for taxing lands, whether as stocks or flows; and why do we tax buildings?
      I will argue below that taxing buildings and the failure to adequately
      tax land both have deleterious consequences for the whole economy.</p>
    <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
      sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or
      two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to
      the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in
      land. American cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at
      least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of
      total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers
      reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
      because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market
      price from the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive
      market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a
      penalty on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their
      maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden
      would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for
      their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
      challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
      particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes,
      evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated
      with administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve
      disputes over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
    <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles.
      Locations are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are
      improved or not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others
      elsewhere,32 a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles
      of sound tax theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however,
      when looking at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
      The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
      as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
      the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
      of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
      data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
      of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
      allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
      Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
      reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
      easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
      features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through
      local or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas
      of greatest market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can
      easily be taxed in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a
      stock. Just as income is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and
      should) be understood as such.</p>
    <p><strong>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
      what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land?</strong> Henry George answered this more
      than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
      since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
      human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to
      land. Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic
      location for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use.
      Regardless whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the
      full extent of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate
      with their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century
      ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without
      working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising
      as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the
      community and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 <strong>Absent
      its recovery by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to
      opportunistically situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected
      rental value is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching
      a market price and sold as a commodity. </strong>Yet simple justice calls for the
      recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the
      failure to recover the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary
      to tax productive activities in our economy, and this leads to economic
      and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It
      means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
    <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production
      not created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or
      sell as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century
      earlier, &#8220;The earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It
      is] given as a common stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This
      passage likely needs a bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct,
      understood since Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the
      right to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
      Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
      allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
      the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
      who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we
      do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
      presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
      that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
      ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
    <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent
