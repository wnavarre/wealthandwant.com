      Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887 speech)
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chattel slavery was incarnate
theft of the worst kind. That system which made property of human
beings, which allowed one person to sell another, which allowed one
person to take away the proceeds of another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the
tearing of the child from the mother, and which permitted the so-called
owner to hunt with bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s
tyranny &#8212; that form of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the
command, "Thou shalt not steal," has been vindicated; but there is
another form of slavery.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We are selling land now in large quantities to certain English
lords, who are coming over here and buying greater estates than the
greatest in Great Britain or Ireland. We are selling them land; they
are buying land. Did it ever occur to you that they do not want that
land? They have no use whatever for American land; they do not propose
to come over here and live on it. They cannot carry it over there to
where they do live.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
you make upon it." What we are selling those foreign lords is not
really land; we are selling them the labor of American citizens; we are
selling them the privilege of taking, without any return for it, the
proceeds of the toil of our children.</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
carriages, houses or much more food and wine. He has gained the power
of taking for his own a great number of these products of human labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. When a man who does no work can
get them, necessarily the people who do work to produce them must have
less of the products of human labor than they ought to have. ...&nbsp;<a

Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic Cause
of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse. ...</p>
    <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must
        draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
        the
        supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
        the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
        the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,
        to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
        of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
        to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
        rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
        wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
        go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
        those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land
        and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among
        all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
        of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q42. Does not the growth of a community increase the value of other things
    as well as of land? For example, does it not add to the value of the services
    of professional men, or of any other business that is dependent upon the
    presence and growth of the community, as truly as it does to the value of
    land?</em><br>
    A. Granted that the growth of a community primarily tends to increase profits,
    the increased profits tend in turn to attract men there to share them. This
    intensifies competition and tends to lower profits. At the same time it increases
    demand for land and tends to enhance the value of that. It therefore cannot
    be said that the growth of a community finally increases the value of other
    things as well as of land. In fact it does not. Appropriate houses in cities
    are no dearer than appropriate houses in the country, differences in cost
    of production being allowed for. And although some professional men get very
    high wages in thickly populated cities, the average comfort of professional
    men in cities is no higher than in the country, if as high. Moreover, even
    if labor values as well as land values were increased by communal growth,
    it must never be forgotten that labor values must always be worked for by
    the individual, whereas land values are never worked for by the individual.
    A lawyer may command enormous fees, but he gets no fee at all unless he works
    for it; but when land commands enormous rent the owner gets it without doing
    the slightest work. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
        Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
        Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend. ...</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

It Over Us</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we&#8217;re spending decades of our
life
trying to purchase what should be our common birthright &#8211; land, the
Common Wealth &#8211; then just who is it who&#8217;s riding on our backs? Here
[we] expose the extent by which the great landowners &#8211; in
Britain, particularly &#8211; &#8220;get rich in their sleep.&#8221; ...<br>
<br>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through creating
wealth (in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in
a free and fair market) or through living off the wealth really created
by others. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. ... <br>
<br>
Here we&#8217;re going to look at one of the most obvious examples of
unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
important, but the value of the land.&nbsp; ... <br>
<br>
Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his
underlings collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated
his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.<br>
<br>
Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre estate
in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
Belgravia, are
today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span><br>
<br>
It was a handy marriage which brought this fortune into the Grosvenor
family&#8217;s hands &#8211; in 1677, Sir Richard Grosvenor married Mary Davies,
heir to the hundred acres north of Piccadilly and the &#8220;Five Fields&#8221;
south of Knightsbridge. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Mayfair and
Belgravia were built up as residential areas for London&#8217;s wealthy
classes, a position they have occupied ever since. Unlike many other
great landowners who have cashed in, the Grosvenors held on and have
benefited enormously from the latest boom in London property prices.<br>
<br>
The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His commercial
property company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast
array of investments and developments around the world. These include
office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>,
business parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>,
luxury
apartments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>. In
the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in
Basingstoke and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use
redevelopment in the centre of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair,
land values are in the stratosphere: in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres of Mayfair for a cool
&pound;335m.</span><br>
<br>
Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land value
taxation, the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never
contemplate selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason
for not selling. (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span

more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing.
Roads are made, streets are made, railway

effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To not one of those improvements does the
land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced. He renders
no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
enrichment is derived. </span>If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
-- ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
the unearned increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be
diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
world -- both in time and money. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And
all the while the land monopolist
has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
his part; and that is justice! ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Every form of
enterprise only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the
cream off for himself&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does not matter where you
look or what examples you select, you will
see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is
only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for
himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to
put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of
wealth and upon every form of industry. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A portion, in some cases the whole, of
every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the
landlord's pocket.</span> If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.
If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway or the institution of
an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering of fares or a new
invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the
workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live,
and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> therefore the landlord and the
ground landlord, one on top of the
other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.
...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Now let the Manchester
Ship Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling -- or an average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now what had the landowner done
for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for
making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">By the stroke
of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy
bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in value. ... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent becomes critically
important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the
differential
return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
location. And that can be priced and collected easily.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Despite assiduous efforts to make clear the extent and the
limits of
the economic rent as a concept &#8212; known as well as land rent, Ricardian
rent, and ground rent, even the best of contemporary neoclassical
economists disagree. Some texts argue that certain athletes or other
star performers with great natural ability reap returns for their
efforts far above what is in fact necessary to &#8220;bring them into
productive use.&#8221; The difference between what it would minimally take to
entice them to perform and the price they are actually paid is all
economic rent. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears, and the
Beatles have all been compensated with impressive amounts of economic
rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Georgists and classical economists are of mixed minds, arguing
sometimes that such payments are either wages or else are simply
transfers that in no way reflect productivity.<small><span

<p>  a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From Wasteland to Promised land: Liberation
  Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The modern equivalent of removing one's
          neighbor's landmark is thus not the private ownership of land per se, but rather
          the private appropriation of land value.</span> "The profit of the earth is
          for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic, to assure everyone the same
          natural opportunity, asserts that all people have an equal right to economic
          rent, and the Levite tithe demonstrates that the socialization of rent offsets
          the ethical and practical harm resulting from private land ownership. But
          there is another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent should
          be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises in large measure
          from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of population, and community
          activity in a particular area. </span>More people means more demand for space
          on which to live and work. Community activities such as roads, schools, protection,
          parks, sewage, utilities and other public services, as well as the totality
          of private commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive
          or desirable. It follows that a community which funds such improvements out
          of its rent fund will be provided with a stable and growing fund with which
          to maintain and improve them. And unlike conventional taxes, the collection
          of this fund will enhance, not penalize, the production of wealth.</small><br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare capacity
          as landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
          use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate scarcity,
          artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any positive contribution
          to production on the part of landowners.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>While land value is not the only type of unearned increment, unearned
          income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not at
          the expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of property in land
          is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx could have -- but did
          not -- champion the abolition of land monopoly; instead he advocated its
          transfer
          from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how the universal
          principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be applied to the modern
          age in all its economic aspects -- rural and urban, agricultural and industrial,
          technologically undeveloped or advanced.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to leave
          land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the existing
          machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to purchase or to
          confiscate private property in land. The first would be unjust; the second,
          needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to
          confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be expropriated or evicted. No
          limit would be placed on the quantity of land one could hold, as long as
          the annual
          rent were paid.</span></small><br>
          <br style="text-decoration: underline;">
          <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the capture
          of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor -- improvements,
          personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. -- would be reduced and
          ultimately eliminated.</span></small><br>
          <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
          <small>George considered his remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw the
          growth of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as an
          expression
          of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes on... so do the
          common wants increase and so does the necessity for public revenue arise.
          And so in
          that value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the individual
          does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a provision intended
          -- we may safely say intended -- to meet that social want."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way to
          stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity, in
          the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land speculation and
          monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes can be impelled to
          serve the needs of the public via investment in production, not by further
          investment in land speculation and monopoly.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Dependency theory, to the degree that it hits upon one of the causes
          of Third World poverty in exploitation by foreign investors, can find in George's
          land value tax the constructive practical approach it lacks. Neither erection
          of trade barriers nor legal restriction of foreign ownership is called for.
        As one Australian writer puts it:</small>  </p>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">(W)hen
      investors from one country buy property in other countries they are seeking <span style="font-weight: bold;">site
      rent</span>, which they hope to obtain directly from tenants, or indirectly
      by selling land in the future when the price or capital value has increased....
      The site rent that is so attractive to overseas investors can be kept in
      the country quite easily - - by shifting taxation from labor onto land."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because George asserted, "We must
    make land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded as an advocate
    of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was nothing of the sort. </span>The
    expropriation of land makes it practically impossible to fairly compensate
    people for the improvements to land, which are their legitimate property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George's system renders
    to the community what is due to the community, without doing any violence
    to the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive workers.&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
    sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained largely
    as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or two have
    buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of
    major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in land. American
    cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least
    when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
    value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers reflect
    enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted because of
    the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from
    the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive market
    presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty
    on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their maintenance.
    Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise
    be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and
    best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges
    of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly
    since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated
    for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with
    administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes
    over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, <strong>&#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;</strong>33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
