<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p> So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p> Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in this world,
    and in our civilization. There is a provision made by the laws of the Creator
    which would secure to the helpless all that they require, which would give
    enough and more than enough for all social purposes. These little children
    that are dying in our crowded districts for want of room and fresh air, they
    are the disinherited heirs of a great estate.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Did you ever consider the full meaning
      of the significant fact that as progress goes on, as population increases
      and civilization develops, the one thing that ever increases in value is
      land? </b>Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever
      there is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a great
      city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the bounty of
      the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or an oil well,
      or a gas deposit, there the speculator jumps in, land rises in value, and
      a great boom takes place, and people find themselves enormously rich without
      ever having done a single thing to produce wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that
    land steadily increases in value; that population adds to it; that invention
    adds to it; that the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s
    goodness in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use adds
    to the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This natural fact
    is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law of the Creator
    as is the law of gravitation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the intent of this natural law of
    increasing land values? Is there not in it a provision for social needs?
    That land values grow greater and greater as the community grows and common
    needs increase: <span style="font-weight: bold;">is there not built into
    this law a manifest provision for social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to
    society as a whole, with which we may take care of those who fall by the
    wayside &#8212; with which we may meet public expenses, and do all the things
    that an advancing civilization makes more and more necessary for society
    to do on behalf of its members?</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today the value of land in New York city
    is over a hundred million <font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff6600">annually</font>.
    Who has created that value? Is it because a few landowners are here that
    that land is worth a hundred million a year? Is it not because the whole
    population of New York is here? Is it not because this great city is the
    center of exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every
    child that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
    add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some portion
    of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being used for that
    purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to appropriate the fund
    of land values?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We might
      take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it make a city here

<p>Everett Gross: <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">Explaining Rent</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs
      a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new building
      on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the
      real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this
      land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is good,
      the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good
      and very fast, and business is good here." </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real
      estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the
      person who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
      build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
      at all!&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now I&nbsp;don't need to use the word "rent" in that explanation. ... <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">see

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The general principle that is
applied in site value rating is that
everyone pays for the naturally created and publicly created
resources they use. There are a number of ways in which this
principle can be extended. Where driving in crowded cities adds
noticeably to the travel costs of others, there should be charges
corresponding to those costs, provided that the administrative costs
of implementing such a system are not so great as to outweigh the
benefits of resulting improvements in traffic flows. Activities such
as the consumption of alcohol that have socially adverse consequences
should be taxed according to the costs of those consequences. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Public
services -- gas, electricity, telephone, water, sewerage,
transportation, etc. -- whether publicly or privately owned, are best
financed by a combination of charges on users and charges on land.
Each user should be required to pay the addition to costs that
results from serving him or her. The component of costs that is not
covered by such charges on users can be recovered by collecting the
increase in land values that comes from provision of public
services.</span>... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed? <strong>...
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair?&nbsp; </small><small><a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
  Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>7. Charges for local public
services, such as water, electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not
generally desirable to make every service completely self-financing.
Rather, what is desirable is that each user be required to pay the
marginal cost of the service he receives. Extensions of service
networks are efficient when they increase publicly collected land rents
by enough to cover the costs not covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small> <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span
