<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC
REVENUE</b>
</small><br>
<small>Adam Smith, in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, suggested that any "tax"
should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
efficiently performed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
meet:
</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Light on the
production of wealth, and does not impede
or reduce production; </small>
  <p><small>2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
understand;</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for
corruption,
and provides adequate revenue;</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received,
impartial,
and just.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
land rent is the only revenue
source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>3. Detailed
causes of artificial scarcity of land. </b>Major forces holding labor
off better lands are the following (George, 1879):
</small>
<blockquote><small>a. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Speculation</span>,&#8221;
conceived as holding land primarily
for its anticipated rise in value. Hasty readers and simplifiers of
George see only this point, overlooking items b-f, following. </small>
  <p><small>b. <span style="font-weight: bold;">High demands of the
rich for
land as a totem</span>, for pleasure and
prestige. This demand rises with income, in greater proportion than
income.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>c. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advance of
labor-stinting,
land-lavishing technology</span>, roughly
associated with economies of scale.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>d. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax bias. Taxes based
on
work, production, exchange, coupled
with preferential tax treatment of landholding, land income, land
gains, etc., create a powerful bias in favor of wasting land and
downsizing labor forces</span> (Gaffney, 1999).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>e. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lack of basic
infrastructure
and public services</span>, due to
constraints on the tax base</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>f. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overpricing and poor
service
from natural monopolies. ...</span> </small></p>

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Natural monopolies (a term
    going
    back to George&#8217;s harbinger,
    J.S. Mill) should be publicly owned, or regulated. Georgism as a
    political movement was closely allied with movements to lower urban
    mass transit fares and improve service, using if necessary the
    property tax base to cover deficits. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Its cost to the economy</small>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest
category of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.<br>
</span></span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Most new
entries into the </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> or </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.</span>
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest. <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span></big></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IF THE APPRAISAL controversy is
framed in terms of business cycle
analysis, then the statistician finds no reasonable alternative to
seeing that when the cycle rises and falls, the difference must be in
the land, not buildings. <b>What people are buying are not
reproduction costs, whose fluctuations over the course of the credit
cycle are relatively minor. They are buying site value, which is in
limited supply, akin to a natural monopoly.</b> Most of all, real
estate investors and homeowners are buying the right to resell their
property as prices are bid up by what they expect to become an
increasingly affluent economy fuelled by an abundant supply of
mortgage credit. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
