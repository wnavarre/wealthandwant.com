    </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span></div>
  <p>If you listen to a Georgist share his or her ideas for a while, you might
    come away with the notion that Georgists consider George's remedy to be a
    panacea &#8212; a cure-all.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In fact, if asked, few of us would make that claim.&nbsp; But most of us
    believe that the huge &#8212; and largely invisible &#8212; distortion
    that George's remedy would remove is an underlying cause of a wide range
    of social and economic problems
  in our beloved country, and that we would as a society be far better off were
  we to implement his
  reform.&nbsp; Would all problems go away?&nbsp; No, of course
  not.&nbsp; But an amazing range of our most troubling problems would be considerably
  lightened, and a great deal of human misery
  eased..&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  There is a line somewhere about the purpose of religion being to comfort the
  afflicted and to afflict the comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp; George's reform would
  provide comfort to many who are afflicted &#8212; including many who can't
  pinpoint the source
  of their affliction &#8212; and perhaps afflict some of the comfortable &#8212;  those
  whose comfort derives from their privileged ability to claim, as if it were
  their own,
  the
  fruits of the labor of others.</p>

  <p>Q1. Do you regard the single tax as a panacea for all social disease?<br>
    A. When William Lloyd Garrison announced his conversion to the single tax
      in a letter to Henry George, he took pains to state that he did not believe
      it to be a panacea, and Mr. George replied : &quot;Neither do I; but I
      believe that freedom is.&quot; Your question may be answered in the same
      way. Freedom is the panacea for social wrongs and the ills they breed,
      and the single tax principle is the tap-root of freedom. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

        I fully recognize that even after we do this, much will remain to do. We

        continued. But whatever else we do, as along as we fail to recognize the
        equal right to the elements of nature, nothing will avail to remedy that

Years Later: The Great Reconciler</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the world
    by identifying one underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">These twin
      plagues arose from concentrated ownership of land, compounded by land speculation.</span> Large
      landowners and speculators (often one and the same) held the best land
      idle or underused, forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages.
      Collapse of speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant exclusive rights
      to use natural resources in a specified territory. It included mining,
      water, fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
      patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban land,
      which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add to "land" such
      items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses and pollution "rights".)
      ... </i></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Neo-classical economists give us only a hard choice: we may have equity,
  or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program reconciles equity
  and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar philosophies, collectivism
  and individualism, and composes them into one solution. He cuts the Gordian
  knot. Like Keynes after him, George inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter
  tradeoffs; we can have it all!"&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

Replacing dismal choices with practical
resolutions and synergies</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>It is part of George's genius that his proposals solve one problem
      by resolving it with another, turning two problems into one solution. It
      is something like tuning up the orchestra for a concert, turning dissonance
      into harmony, and keeping the beat together, turning cacaphony into rhythm.
      It is the mark of good solutions that they reconcile and resolve, rather
      than simply "trade-off." <font size="-2"><small><i>1</i> </small></font> </small></p>
  <blockquote><small> </small>
      <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>1 If you ever immerse yourself
              in mathematics deeply enough to find different proofs of the same
              proposition, you recognize the epiphany when it all comes together,
              and everything supports and confirms everything else. Then you
              know you have the right answer. Good ideas and good policies support
              and reinforce each other. </small></font></small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
  <p><small>That is what George means when he writes that "the laws of the universe
      are harmonious." That is what Founding Fathers like Washington, Jefferson
      and Franklin meant by a "natural order." Like them, George is a deist in
      spirit, a believer in the consistency of the universe. The concept that
      some things are more "natural" than others is not arbitrary. The clue that
      one has found the "natural" law is that it makes forces harmonize and team
      together instead of clashing, and neutralizing each other. <font size="-2"><small><i>2</i></small></font> The
      principle of constructive synthesis - a touch of Hegel - is another way

  <blockquote><small> </small>
      <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>2. In this view, the "natural
              harmony" is recognized by its power to reconcile. Deadlocks and
              standoffs resolve into teamwork, yielding gains at little or no
              cost. Today, philosophers may avoid terms like "natural law." Call
              it what you will, it is a powerful idea and a worthy goal. Fashions
              and terms change: principles endure.</small></font> </small>

                  hard choices must be made. </small></font></small></p>
          <small> </small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
  <p><small>Economists today offer us mainly "trade-offs" and hard choices. For
      every good thing we must give up another, so net gains are just marginal.
      That is the approved posture: it makes one seem hard-headed, worldly, and
      practical. Too much positive thinking sounds suspiciously optimistic, and
      invites rebellious cynical muttering that "there ain't no free lunch." It
      goes back at least to Malthus, who offered mankind the hard choice of food
      vs. sex. That sort of thinking is what made people call economics "the
      dismal science."</small></p>
  <p><small>A true resolution is much more to be desired. To get one good thing
      we get a second one as well. It is remarkable how many "hard choices" are
      turned into benign resolutions in George's program. He is a genius at finding
      the essential harmony of interests now concealed beneath confused thinking.
      Instead of a dismal trade-off, there is a "free lunch," or "synergy": the
      whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Such grand resolutions, when
      possible, deserve to be called "true win-win solutions." <font size="-2"><small><i>4 </i></small></font></small></p>
  <blockquote><small> </small>
      <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>4. As commonly used today, "win-win
              solution" is just a euphemism for a trade-off, in which the loser
              of a resource "wins" by getting paid.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Often it is worse: the "winnings" of one
              or both parties represent resources stolen from the public domain,
              while concealing the loss to the public.</span></small></font></small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
  <p><small>The most obvious such true win-win solution is putting the unemployed
      to work.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Recognizing this truth
      is no monopoly of George: Keynesian economists long insisted that there
      is no social cost in putting the unemployed to work. It is a measure of
      the bankruptcy and myopia of many economists today that even those voices
      are muted, and that obvious gain is denied: working is called a "sacrifice
      of leisure," just another trade-off. Unemployment has become "job-searching." <font size="-2"><small><i>5</i></small></font> It
      is more likely a sacrifice of burglary, vandalism, drug-use, jail time,
      loitering, looting, collecting welfare, and sullen misery. Trading such
      bad time for the gratification, pride, on-the-job learning, and moral uplift
      of working is not a trade-off, but a double gain. It is a true "free lunch," if
      you will.</small></p>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Many economists
  today react to such ideas with reflexive disbelief. They put down optimistic
  claims by calling them "panaceas," too good to be true.</span> TAANSTAAFL <font size="-2"><small><i>6</i></small></font> is
  their slogan; cynicism their preferred posture. However, false pessimism is
  just as false and damaging as false optimism. A truer slogan is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TITSTAAFL: "There Is Too Such a Thing As A Free Lunch."</span> It's
  rather a question of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WIGGI?: "Who Is Going to Get It?"</span>. Many dismal
  alleged trade-offs are just someone's mental blocks that stand athwart the
  path to abundance, or, worse, ways to control and exploit us. Often, in fact, "we
  can have it all." Is it too good to be true? Let us itemize the many resolutions
  of alleged trade-offs and standoffs that George's program will achieve. </small>
  <blockquote><small> </small>
      <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>6 "There Ain't No Such Thing
              As A Free Lunch."</small></font></small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
  <small><b>Epilogue: how the public demonstrates its preference for resolutions
  over dismal choices</b></small>
  <p><small>Preaching hard trade-offs is not popular. Voters see through it as
      a confession of cluelessness. We hear a lot about voter apathy, but voters
      have responded positively at various times to candidates with positive
      resolutions, or apparent ones.</small></p>
  <p><small>Remember the "Phillips Curve" of the late 1970s? "The public has
      to grow up and choose," the gurus said with some condescension. It's either
      inflation or unemployment. Soon the voters came up with a third choice,
      they retired those unavailing later Keynesians.</small></p>
  <p><small>Next it was Reagan and Laffer, who said you can have lower tax rates
      and higher tax revenues, more defense and a lower deficit. Talk about panaceas!
      This one proved to be a fraud, but the voters loved it until they slowly
      realized the promise couldn't possibly be delivered.</small></p>
  <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>Now it is the <b>privatizers</b>.
      They have learned to sell the product by soft-pedaling "trade-offs." Instead,
      they talk about "win-win" solutions, a new euphemism for trade-offs that
      camouflages them as resolutions, and hides the sneaky truth that much of
      the wins come from privatizing public property without compensation. The
      public will stop falling for it as they finally realize that most of these
      are really "win-win-lose" solutions, with the public as the loser.</small></p>
  <p><small>30 years ago, it was "demand-side economics" (as it was later called).
      It was mostly Keynesian "fiscal policy," with some monetary policy, also
      demand-sided, as its Tweedledum rival. Keynes became popular because orthodox
      economists, unavailing, had reduced themselves to posing a hard choice.
      To escape from depression, they said, you must first suffer dismally: cut
      wages, consume less. It's like a hangover, you must repent of the good
      times you had in the roaring twenties. The voters rejected that preaching
      thumpingly.</small></p>
  <p><small>Keynes had better news. He said you can have it all: raise wages,
      consume more, enjoy more public services, and in result find people saving
      more and working more! People who followed his ideas won elections for
      years. With all its faults and charlatanism, Keynesian economics was at
      least optimistic and hopeful. It lasted until his successors fell into
      the dismal trade-off mode of the Phillips Curve.</small></p>
  <p><small> Before that it was the New Deal panacea: national planning. Before
      that, at least in the States under Herbert Hoover, it was business "Associationism":
      cartels, plus peace pacts, red-baiting, debt retirement, the corporate
      state, two chickens in every pot and a car in every garage. We know where
      that led.</small></p>
  <p><small>Before those panaceas there was Henry George. He, like popular figures
      after him, was anything but dismal. He, too, said "we can have it all." It
      made his ideas very popular. We are often told that Georgism never really
      made it, but that is warped history. It never "took over" lock, stock and
      barrel, but it won substantial minorities, to whom real concessions were
      made. His ideas were at their political crest roughly from 1901-20. <font size="-2"><small><i>14</i></small></font> They
      were incorporated into The Progressive Movement.</small></p>
  <blockquote><small> </small>
      <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>14 They were carried towards
              the top by such well-known figures as David Lloyd George in England,
              Alexandr Kerensky in Russia, Sun Yat-sen in China, hundreds of
              local and state, and a few powerful national politicians in both
              Canada and the U.S.A., Billy Hughes in Australia, Rolland O'Regan
              in New Zealand, Chaim Weizmann in Palestine, Francisco Madero in
              Mexico, and many others around the world. In the States, they were
              an integral part of the Progressive Movement, which for a time
              dominated both our major parties. In England, Lloyd George's budget
              speech of 1909 reads in part as though written by Henry George
              himself; some of Winston Churchill's speeches <i>were</i> written
              by Georgist ghosts.</small></font></small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
  <p><small>Unlike the other panaceas cited, George's never failed. It would
      be fairer to say it fell to the loss of young leaders in World War I, and
      the marathon Red Scare that dominated much of the world from 1919 to 1989.
      The Red Scare energized property defenders everywhere; by confusion, its
      victims included Georgism. It made Georgists pull in their horns until
      their message lost its vigor and excitement: its resolving qualities, which
      were derided as "panaceas." Now, with the fall of the Soviet Empire, is
      a good time to pick up where the Progressive Movement was aborted.</small> <small><span

      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We still need to judge whether it is fair for only landowners to pay the taxes,
      rather than to spread the burden on all who get income or spend money or have
      wealth.</p>
  <p>Natural-law philosophers such as John Locke have reasoned that all human
    beings have a natural ownership right to their labor and the products of
    that labor.
      The fundamental equality of humanity means it is fundamentally wrong for
    some to take away the labor done by others.31 That notion is almost universally
      recognized today with respect to slavery, and some folks are beginning
    to recognize
      that the current tax system&#8212;which taxes our earnings and taxes how we
      invest or spend those earnings&#8212;also violates man&#8217;s natural
      right to the fruits of his labor.</p>
  <p>If taking the fruit of one&#8217;s labor is fundamentally unjust, how can
      a community raise the monies needed to build essential infrastructure and provide
      public services? Land value taxation takes into account not only the value
      of the land due to nature, such as soil and climate, but also the great increase
      in land values that result from population, commerce, security and other civic
      services, and public works&#8212;elements beyond the activity of the property
      owner. The windfall increase in the rental or land value of the land, contended
      Henry George and others, is a surplus that can be tapped by the community.32</p>
  <p>Those suggesting positive consequences of shifting taxation to rent have been
      accused of exaggerating its beneficial effects.33 <strong>Freedom from punitive
      taxation is not a panacea, but the infliction of arbitrary costs on enterprise
      and the
      skewing of market signals such as prices and profits is indeed a universal
      and major cause of economic woes. It is not an exaggeration to propose that
      removing these would have many beneficial results, just as one&#8217;s health
      improves considerably if one stops taking poison.</strong> ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Enthusiastic proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas have often presented
    them as a panacea for the economic, social and environmental problems that
    beset contemporary society. Indeed, the Georgist analysis does have much
    to offer. By more adequately addressing land as a unique economic, social
    and ecological resource, it can help to reveal underlying causes of currently
    pressing issues such as declining housing affordability, growing economic
    inequality, and environmental decay.</p>
  <p>The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217; can also play an important role
    in the redress of these problems. However, there are limitations to the modern
    application of George&#8217;s ideas, as outlined in this article. While a
    uniform land tax is a necessary component in addressing contemporary political
    economic problems, it is not sufficient. It needs to be set in the context
    of a broader political economic analysis and policy program, also addressing
    public housing, urban and regional policies, environmental taxes and regulations, &#8216;floors
    and ceilings&#8217; to limit income inequalities and macroeconomic stabilisation.</p>
  <p>While the Georgist analysis redresses the general neglect of land in modern
    economic orthodoxy, it is important not to go too far to the other extreme.
    In other words, the important emphasis on land should not come at the expense
    of attention to problems associated with labour and capital and to the complex
    forms of government policy necessary for the balancing of contemporary economic,
    social and ecological concerns. The Georgist analysis needs to be integrated
    into a comprehensive political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism.</p>
  <p>So what does &#8216;putting Henry George in his place&#8217; entail? It
    means recognising the political economic importance of land and the potential
    social gains from the extension of land taxation. Equally, it means recognising
    the necessity of relating Georgist ideas and policy prescriptions to a broader
    canvas of modern political economy, including the analytical traditions associated
    with Karl Marx, J. M. Keynes, and J. K. Galbraith, and modern environmental
    economics. Henry George&#8217;s place is in good company. <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read
