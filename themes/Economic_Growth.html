  <p align="left">Most of us would say that we favor policies that promote economic
    growth. And yet we tolerate tax policies which provide perverse incentives:
    polices that increase the price of land, policies that privatize what should
    be common property, policies that take what should be private property. How
    backwards we are! And then we wonder why wages fail to keep up with the cost
    of living, and why poverty is on the increase, and our children can't afford
    housing, and why wealth is increasingly concentrated in a relatively small
    portion of our population. Is there an alternative? Absolutely. Reduce taxes
    on wages -- starting with those who have the lowest incomes. Increase taxes
    that are on land values, which none of us can legitimately claim to have
    created, starting with the highest-valued land. Stop taxing profits. Start
    taxing what individuals and corporations take from the commons, charging
    for the electromagnetic spectrum and other such resources.</p>

Henry George: <a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The Single
Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>From the Single Tax we
may expect these
      <small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:
<strong>...</strong></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>2. It would enormously increase
the production of wealth--</small></p>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(a) By the removal of the
burdens that now weigh upon industry and thrift. If we tax houses,
there will be fewer and poorer houses; if we tax machinery, there will
be less machinery; if we tax trade, there will be less trade; if we tax
capital, there will be less capital; if we tax savings, there will be
less savings. All the taxes therefore that we would abolish are those
that repress industry and lessen wealth. But <b>if we tax land values,
there will be no less land.</b></small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(b) On the contrary, <b>the
taxation of land values has the effect of making land more easily
available by industry,</b> since it makes it more difficult for owners
of valuable land which they themselves do not care to use to hold it
idle for a large future price. While the abolition of taxes on labor
and the products of labor would free the active element of production,
the taking of land values by taxation would free the passive element by
destroying speculative land values and preventing the holding out of
use of land needed for use. If any one will but look around today and
see the unused or but half-used land, the idle labor, the unemployed or
poorly employed capital, he will get some idea of how enormous would be
the production of wealth were all the forces of production free to
engage.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(c) <b>The taxation of the
processes and products of labor on one hand, and the insufficient
taxation of land values on the other, produce an unjust distribution of
wealth</b> which is building up in the hands of a few, fortunes more
monstrous than the world has ever before seen, while the masses of our
people are steadily becoming relatively poorer. These taxes necessarily
fall on the poor more heavily than on the rich; by increasing prices,
they necessitate a larger capital in all businesses, and consequently
give an advantage to large capitals; and they give, and in some cases
are designed to give, special advantage and monopolies to combinations
and trusts. On the other hand, the insufficient taxation of land values
enables men to make large fortunes by land speculation and the increase
of ground values--fortunes which do not represent any addition by them
to the general wealth of the community, but merely the appropriation by
some of what the labor of others creates.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>This unjust distribution of
wealth develops on the one hand a class idle and wasteful because they
are too rich, and on the other hand a class idle and wasteful because
they are too poor</b>. It deprives men of capital and opportunities
which would make them more efficient producers. It thus greatly
diminishes production.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(d) <b>The unjust distribution
which is giving us the hundred-fold millionaire on the one side and the
tramp and pauper on the other, generates thieves, gamblers, and social
parasites of all kinds,</b> and requires large expenditure of money and
energy in watchmen, policemen, courts, prisons, and other means of
defense and repression. It kindles a greed of gain and a worship of
wealth, and produces a bitter struggle for existence which fosters
drunkenness, increases insanity, and causes men whose energies ought to
be devoted to honest production to spend their time and strength in
cheating and grabbing from each other. Besides the moral loss, all this
involves an enormous economic loss which the Single Tax would save.</small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(e)<b> The taxes we would
abolish fall most heavily on the poorer agricultural districts, and
tend to drive population and wealth from them to the great cities</b>.
The tax we would increase would destroy that monopoly of land which is
the great cause of that distribution of population which is crowding
the people too closely together in some places and scattering them too
far apart in other places. Families live on top of one another in
cities because of the enormous speculative prices at which vacant lots
are held. In the country they are scattered too far apart for social
intercourse and convenience, because, instead of each taking what land
he can use, every one who can grabs all he can get, in the hope of
profiting by its increase in value, and the next man must pass farther
on. Thus we have scores of families living under a single roof, and
other families living in dugouts on the prairies afar from
neighbors--some living too close to each other for moral, mental, or
physical health, and others too far separated for the stimulating and
refining influences of society. The wastes in health, in mental vigor,
and in unnecessary transportation result in great economic losses which
the Single Tax would save. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What would be the direct
result? Take this city, this State or
the whole country; abolish all taxes on the production of wealth; let
every man be free to plough, to sow, to build, in any way add to the
common stock without being fined one penny. Say to every man who
would improve, who would in any way add to the production of wealth:
Go ahead, go ahead; produce, accumulate all you please; add to the
common stock in any way you choose; you shall have it all; we shall
not fine or tax you one penny. What would be the result of abolishing
all these taxes that now depress industry; that now fall on labour;
that now lessen the profits of those who are adding to the general
wealth? Evidently to stimulate production; to increase wealth; to
bring new life into every vocation of industry. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other side what would be
the effect when abolishing all
these taxes that now fall on labour or the products of labour, if we
were to resort for public revenue to a tax upon land values; a tax
that would fall on the owner of a vacant lot just as heavily as upon
the man who has improved a lot by putting up a house; that would fall
on the speculator who is holding 160 acres of agricultural land idle,
waiting for a tenant or a purchaser, as heavily as it would fall upon
the farmer who had made the 160 acres bloom? Why, the result would be
everywhere that the dog in the manger would he checked; for the
result everywhere would he that the men who are holding natural
opportunities, not for use but simply for profit, by demanding a
price of those who must use them, would have either to use their land
or give way to somebody who would.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
<small>.</small></strong><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html">Read

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html">Basic Tenets of the
Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b>
</small><br>
<small>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their
embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in which our ideas
promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful....&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html"><br>
</a></b>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recognition of the equal rights of
all to natural opportunities,
through land value taxation and its extension to charges for the use
of other resources, is not only just and efficient, but has the
capacity to make a major contribution to economic growth. This occurs
through a variety of paths.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most important path is that
public collection of the value of
exclusive use of natural opportunities provides revenue that makes it
possible to <span style="font-weight: bold;">remove taxes from the
earnings of labor and capital</span>. When
people are taxed less, they earn more. Using data that emerged from
changes in U.S. tax rates, Feldstein has estimated that the
elasticity of earnings with respect to the fraction of income not
taken at the margin by federal taxes is at least 1.0 (and more for
workers in higher tax
brackets).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>6</i></b></small></font> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When the entity that
removes a tax on labor is less than global, this action also attract
labor to the region.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When taxes are removed from
capital, the effect is even more
powerful, as long as the entity removing the tax is less than global.
Capital is extremely mobile in response to regional changes in net
returns. It is highly counterproductive for any locality or nation to
tax capital, because there will be virtually no effect on the return
to capital after taxes. Capital will merely be driven from the taxed
region until the return after taxes matches what can be obtained
elsewhere. If the whole world removes taxes from capital, the
resulting increase in the rate of return to capital will increase the
rate of saving, but the adjustment will occur over some years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land has an additional
effect that increases the stock of
capital. A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults
to the young and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land.
Unless there is a perfectly offsetting reduction in the desire to
accumulate assets to transfer to the next generation, this
redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer assets, to
accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land also increases the
efficiency with which land is used.
This occurs through three paths.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land
speculation, and therefore reduces the quantity of land speculation. </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling
price of land, the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the
annual tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land
relatively more attractive to bidders with high discount rates and
relatively less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the
extent that the former are more entrepreneurial and the latter more
passive investors, land will tend to flow into the hands of persons who
will choose to use it more intensively. </small></li>
  <li><small>The third path by which a tax on land increases the
efficiency with which land is used is that, for those who are using
land inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an
implicit one (the income foregone by inefficient use). </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Psychologically, explicit costs
tend to be more effective in
motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones.<b>... </b><span

tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>To send a clear message to new businesses
that their growth will not be unnecessarily impeded, government can
permanently shift taxes off sales, income, and buildings and onto land.
Since taxing land lowers its cost, business could pay this greater land
tax from what otherwise would be spent on purchasing land. This higher
land levy would remain affordable as long as owners use their land
efficiently.<br>
<br>
Developers argue that abundant land lowers its price and thus the
property tax burden. While true, newly-available land need not be
current open space. Without baring the countryside to new development,
both land price and the property tax can be lowered. The price of land
drops when the tax rate on land is raised. And yet this higher rate, if
coupled with a lower or absent rate on buildings, does not swell the
property tax burden of most residents. Indeed, this <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">property tax shift
(PTS)</span> is progressive, providing relief for most residents. And
by
taxing land, society impels owners who had been speculatively
withholding or underutilizing theirs to develop or offer their parcels
for development. Hence the newly-available land comes from recycled
sites, not from open space. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small><b>PTS Improves the Economy<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small>Land that is higher taxed is
lower priced.
Cheaper land reduces buyers' debt. Less demand for loans lowers the
lending rate. Cheaper capital means more investment and more
employment. In Australia, in the province around Melbourne, some towns
levy the regular property tax, others tax only land. Those with the
same rate for sites and structures suffer more bankruptcies; those with
one rate for land enjoy more successful business start-ups.<br>
<br>
<b>
</b>The PTS encourages investing in high-yield use of parcels.
Developing land generates jobs in construction. As those construction
workers spend their incomes, they generate more business for local
merchants. For the few years that New York exempted buildings in the
1920s, the city boomed more than any other US city. In New Zealand,
over 80% of the towns tax land, not buildings. Before the 70's oil
shock hit, they enjoyed over a decade of employment at 99%.<br>
<br>
A stable source of revenue is a virtue in the eyes of any government.
When recession strikes, governments that tax income or property must
borrow more to make ends meet. The disincentives built into ordinary
taxes deepen and prolong the recession. When taxes upon effort are
eased, the economies can recover.<br>
<br>
The PTS can cure local recessions. Spurring building, while not
burdening it, keeps a web of regional suppliers, installers,
architects, financiers, and others in greater demand. In the 17 Western
Australian cities in the Perth area that had shifted to land taxation,
new construction increased by 34% from 1971-76, while nine localities
with ordinary property taxes saw a .02% decrease. From 1974-84, a
period marked by recession in the latter half, towns near Melbourne
that tax land alone saw the number of businesses increase by 11%,
whereas cities without land taxation witnessed a drop of 20% (Cord
1998). Similarly, in the early 1990s, Connellsville and Washington,
Pennsylvania, turned to the PTS; both enjoyed more new construction and
housing (CSE 1997). Such examples illustrate the stable growth
unleashed by the PTS.<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from
less.&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_Left_Must.html"><big><big><small><small><span

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About the
Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To pay the land
dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much of the public discussion of
capital gains policy has been
conducted with little reference to empirical research as to their
actual character and composition in the US economy. Capital gains, and
savings in general, are defended on the assumption that they are
automatically transformed into new direct investment. Yet the more
layers has the debt pyramid, the smaller is the proportion of savings
used to finance direct investment. Moreover, our investigation suggests
that a large and expanding share of the economy's capital gains -- as
they are defined, measured and taxed -- has little discernible impact
on net investment or employment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>IRS estimates of capital gains measure only the small proportion
that
individuals are obliged to declare after all the exemptions and
exclusions have been utilized. There is no estimate of the volume of
capital gains generated each year, and no adequate breakdown as to
where these gains occur. This statistical lacuna means that the
economic cost of assorted tax loopholes is not being calculated. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is no sound
statistical basis for calculating the total returns being taken by
investors, or the proportion of those returns paid in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">taxes.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>When
statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
less than their legislated tax share. Also -- and of direct relevance
to
our thesis -- the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
indeed tend to spur productivity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Academic economists likewise have been remarkably slow to
address this
shift away from earned income to capital gains. It is true that
nineteenth-century land reformers such as John Stuart Mill and Leon
Wahas defined land-value gains as an &#8220;unearned increment,&#8221; and urged
that they be collected by the community at large, whose economic
activity was, after all, responsible for creating these gains. Ever
since Henry George brought matters to a head in <span
 style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small></small>
(1879),
however, economics has largely dropped the analysis of land-value
gains, and indeed, of land itself</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Wealthy
investors have won congressional support for
real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
Household real estate assets substantially exceeded holdings of stocks,
bonds and trust funds (20.5 percent in 1989), liquid assets (17
percent) and total debt (14 percent).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> The
giveaway to real estate interests is thus presented ostensibly as a
popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that
preferences for home ownership cannot be justified as a boost to
entrepreneurial investment. Such is the foreshortened economic
perspective of our times.</small></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to the
buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate
balance
sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is
thus by
no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
securities today.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases,
lenders,
for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other
natural
resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
-- and the capital gains on these assets -- than they do its income.
They
also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained.
Edward
Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
society.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">43 Wolff (1995),
        p. 27. &#8220;The top
one percent of wealth holders
has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
percentile of the income distribution.&#8221;</font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Given the current US depreciation laws and
related
institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
sold off to meet current expenses -- sold to the very wealth-holders
being
freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
these gains at a lower rate than earned income -- a&nbsp; fight that
has broken
out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections. </small><a

Tony Vickers: <a href="../docs/Vickers_Zee_Vee.html">From Zee to Vee:
using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Nobel-winning economist
    <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William Vickre</a>y said that the property
tax is actually two different taxes (Vickrey 1991). That is because
buildings are capital, not land, in the economic sense &#8211; even
if, in most legal codes, there is no distinction between land and
improvements made to it which are all lumped together as &#8216;landed
property&#8217; or real estate. Buildings and other improvements to
land all depreciate over time unless further capital is expended.
Eventually the market value of such <i>improvements</i> may become
negative, owing to the costs that would need to be incurred by
someone wishing to redevelop the site for an alternative use. But
that does not necessarily take away the rental value of the
<i>site</i>.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much urban blight is caused by
these so-called &#8216;brown
field&#8217; vacant and under-used sites. However they are often in
valuable locations, with good transport connections. It may be that
owners are speculating that land prices will rise and enable them to
sell at greater profit in the future than now, or it may be that
there is genuinely no market for sites in a particular location
unless the cost of remediation is subsidised as a form of public
investment. Such investment, according to Vickrey and other followers
of Henry George, can be entirely funded from LVT. In a lecture given
in 1991, first published last year, Vickrey claimed:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;Cities have the
capacity to be fully self-financing without dependence on either
federal assistance or on general taxes that are unrelated to benefits
received.&#8221;</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proviso, according to Vickrey,
is to replace the tax on
buildings with a tax on land value alone &#8211; LVT:-</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;The property tax
combines one of the best and one of the worst taxes we have. The
portion that falls on sites or land values is the only major tax that
is reasonably free of distortionary effects and is not intolerably
regressive&#8221;.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing
buildings and work done to improve them discourages such
work. Un-taxing them and taxing land more highly, irrespective of its
actual state of development but based upon its </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">highest and best
immediate potential use</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">, will
encourage owners to maintain their
sites and buildings in such a way as to maximise their income. </span><i>A
remote site or one with conservation or other restrictions will have
a low site value, hence attract low taxes, whereas a high value city
centre derelict site will very soon be redeveloped.</i> The extra
property tax revenue from extending the tax base to sites that are
currently under-taxed (because the tax is based primarily on
building/rental value not site/owner value), ensures public
infrastructure projects can be funded without resource to general
taxes or excessive borrowing on the financial markets.</small>&nbsp; <span

to contend that we have solved the twin problems of full employment and
economic growth. The truth is that we have lived all these postwar

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have these
considerations to do with property taxation? The purpose of my talk is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span> I shall try to
explain why I believe that property taxation is one of the two chief
villains in the drama we are witnessing today in these United States.
The other villain is the monetary policy pursued by the government,
which has increased the cost of borrowing to a point where it stifles
the growth of the economy. In this context however I shall be concerned
only with property taxation.<br>
<br>
Two schools of thought have emerged as to the merits or defects of
property taxation: 
</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>one school condemns the American system of property
taxation in
every conceivable way. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The other school underscores the advantages of taxing land
and
untaxing improvements. <strong>...</strong></small></li>
</ul>
<small>Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
industrialization and urbanization in the
second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span><br>
<br>
The apostle of land taxation is Henry George. In his famous book <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a> he develops
his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land.<strong> ... <br>
</strong><br>
Three criteria are generally used to judge the merits of a tax.</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>First, it must be satisfactory as a revenue producer, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>second it must be equitable and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>third its economic effects should not collide with the
public
interest. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>For instance if full employment and economic growth are regarded
as
desirable, the question to be examined is what effects will this tax
have on achieving these objectives? <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land.<br>
<br>
That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span>
The housing construction industry employed about 2,200,000 people in
1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Any change in the direction of
home building employment is multiplied 2.57 times. </span>Thus an
increase in housing starts by 50% would give employment to 2.8 million
persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3 would create about 3.6
million jobs. These figures do not take into consideration the
investment in public utilities, streets, schools etc., that would be
required to service these additional housing units. ...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span><br>
<br>
Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage.<br>
<br>
For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span><br>
<br>
A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage. ...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small>
<ul>
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property
taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land. </span><small><big><big><a
