excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>DWARFED into mere revenue reform the harmony and beauty of free trade are
    hidden; its moral force is lost; its power to remedy social evils cannot
    be shown, and the injustice and meanness of protection cannot be arraigned.
    The "international law of God" becomes a mere fiscal question which appeals
    only to the intellect and not to the heart, to the pocket and not to the
    conscience, and on which it is impossible to arouse the enthusiasm that is
    alone capable of contending with powerful interests. &#8212; <em>Protection
    or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 29: Practical Politics - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT29.html">econlib</a> <br>
            <br>
THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders" who
have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the full
sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax, they proposed
the only means by which the free trade principle can ever be carried to its logical
conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade but of all other forms and
modes of production, with full freedom of access to the natural element which
is essential to all production. They were the authors of the motto that in the
English use of the phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez aller!" "Clear
the ways and let things alone." This is said to come from the cry that in medieval
tournaments gave the signal for combat, The English motto which I take to come
closest to the spirit of the French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em><br>
            <br>
HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound, blindfolded, and
gagged. Shall we stand in a knot about him and discuss whether to put a piece
of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on his coat, or shall we dispute
with each other as to what road he ought to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle,
a horse and wagon, or a railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather
postpone such discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for
himself, speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
a torn coat, he may get on his feet, and if he cannot find a conveyance to suit
him, he will at least be free to walk. <br>
            <br>
Very much like such a discussion is a good deal of that now going on over "the
social problem" &#8212; a discussion in which all sorts of inadequate and impossible
schemes are advocated to the neglect of the simple plan of removing restrictions
and giving Labor the use of its powers. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The English free-trader Cobden
remarked that "you who free the
land will do more for the people than we who have freed trade."
Indeed, how can anyone speak of free trade when the trader has to pay
tribute to some favored land-entitlement holder in order to do
business?</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>This imperfect policy
of non-intervention, or
laissez-faire, led straight to a most hideous and dreadful economic
exploitation; starvation wages, slum dwelling, killing hours,
pauperism, coffin-ships, child-labour -- nothing like it had ever been
seen in modern times ... People began to say, if this is what State
abstention comes to, let us have some State intervention. </i> </small>
  <p><small><i>But the state </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> intervened; that
was
the whole trouble. The State had established one monopoly--the
landlord's monopoly of economic rent--thereby shutting off great hordes
of people from free access to the only source of human subsistence, and
driving them into factories to work for whatever Mr. Gradgrind and Mr.
Bottles chose to give them. The land of England, while by no means
nearly all </i><b><i>actually</i></b><i> occupied, was all </i><b><i>legally</i></b><i>
occupied; and this State-created monopoly enabled landlords to satisfy
their needs and desires with little exertion or none, but it also
removed the land from competition with industry in the labor market,
thus creating a huge, constant and exigent labour-surplus. </i>[Emphasis
Nock's] --Albert J. Nock, "The Gods' Lookout" February 1934 </small><small>... <a
