  <p>Gini and Lorenz are two related measures of inequality.&nbsp; The Lorenz
      curve is a graph of the distribution of population and the distribution
    of wealth
      or income; the Gini measure is the decimal measure of the area below that

  <p>For the purposes of measuring the concentration of land, two measures are
    of interest.&nbsp; First, acreage.&nbsp; Second, and much more meaningful
    in an urbanized society, land value.&nbsp; Bill Batt has pointed out that
    a single acre in Manhattan (including an obsolete building which was prompty
    demolished) sold for about $250 million, <strong><em>more than the value of all the

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgists have focused on urban
land, stressing its stupendous
value p.s.f., and also its high value per capita. Some have favored
ignoring rural areas completely, to placate the rural vote, and the
putative empathy of urban Americans with their rural roots, and the
supposed rural preservation of old cultural values. If those notions
ever had merit, they do not today. George himself did not think they
had merit in his day, either: his first book, <b><i>Our Land and Land
Policy</i></b> (1871) went into great detail about the villainies
(his word) involved in monopolizing rural land from the public
domain. He demolished economist Francis A. Walker while exposing how
Walker&#8217;s direction of the U.S. Census concealed the concentrated
ownership of rural land &#8211; an early example of &#8220;How to Lie
with Statistics.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the process,
George invented what today is
called the Lorenz Curve, and influenced the U.S. Census to begin
arranging data in a template geared to that curve, and to report on
land separate from buildings (which it did until 1940).</span><a

is a Progressive Tax</a><br>
<br>
Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RBPTatCFLO.html"><small>The Relationship Between Property Taxation and the
Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real
wage rates, meanwhile since 1955, have not risen as fast as
real land prices, and they haven't risen at all since 1975. </span>This
has
raised the labor-price of land (the number of days/years a person must
work at the average wage
rate in order to raise the price of a farm.)&nbsp; Coupling this with
rising acres per farm, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
labor-price of a farm roughly tripled, from about 6 years' wages
(before payroll deductions) in 1954 to about 17 years' wages in 1987</span>.
That, of course, doesn't mean you could buy a farm in 17 years, unless
you didn't eat
anything and saved every penny of your wages to buy a farm.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>That is the mean size. At the same time, concentration of
ownership was rising. That was the subject Henry George and Francis
Walker debated way back in the 1880s. In the process Henry George
invented something, later
to be known as the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "Lorenz Curve"</span>
- academicians are not generous
about crediting Henry George with his various contributions to the
discipline of
political economy. Basically this Lorenz Curve is a way of measuring
concentration by answering the question, what fraction of all the land
is owned by the top ten
percent. The curve extends from zero up to 100 percent. This curve
has been reduced to a single figure, called the Gini Ratio, which is a
measure of concentration
which varies between zero and one. At zero, everyone has the same
amount; at one, one person has it all.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1900 the Census Bureau began publishing farm data ranked by
acres per farm. Using those data, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Gini Ratio was .58 in 1900.</span> By
1930 the GR had gotten up only to .63. This, remember, was the peak
year of property
taxes, before the property tax started waning. The GR began to rise
faster, and by 1950 it was up to .70. It plateaued there for 15 years
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">then rose again to .76
by 1987</span>. That is a high degree of concentration. (By comparison,
GRs
for personal income are much lower, about .40, and are much more stable
over decades.) The
accelerated rise since 1930 coincided with the rise of mean acres per
farm, and both followed the fall of property tax rates.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Gini Ratio has been criticized because it deals only with
the
concentration among existing farms, and doesn't take into account all
of the former farmers who left the business. To adjust for this, we can
simply add them
to the distribution of the farms as farmers with zero land. There are
4-1/2 million farms that died between 1935 and 1988. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you add in the farmers with zero
acres of land to the lowest bracket, that raises GR for 1988 from .76
to .92</span>, a radical rise of inequality since 1930 (.63). But
calculating the ratio this way
gives you a better sense of how concentration has shot up during and
since the Great Depression. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the
Great Depression (1930-1941), six million farms provided a
refuge for the urban jobless and homeless. Today, that refuge is
closed.</span> </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Mining has taken over the Appalachians, where farmers
could make moonshine. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Farming
has been taken over by forestry and recreation in the Ozarks. ... </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land in farms of 1,000 acres and
over actually dropped
(nationally) by 15 percent from 1900 to 1910, the only drop on
record. Now, however, 34 percent of all irrigated land is in the top
bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. Control of irrigated land means control over water. Control of
water gives control over arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control
based on water have become
highly concentrated. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For farms with
irrigated land, the Gini Ratio is
.82, substantially higher than the GR of .76 for all farms.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">From 1930-87, the fraction of
all farm acres in units of 1,000
acres and over rose from 28% of the total to 62% of the total. </span>That
is a rise of 123% over the 1930 base. That rise in degree of
concentration is impressive, all
by itself. At the same time, however, the mean value per acre in the
largest spreads was rising much faster than that of other farms. In
result, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the value of the
real estate (land and buildings) in these giant spreads rose from 8%
of the total in 1930 to 38% of the total in 1987.</span> That is a rise
of 375% over the 1930 base.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
second thing that makes the trivialization humbug is a
statistical principle called "regression fallacy."</span> Many people,
otherwise bright, are thicker than mud when it comes to picking up on
this principle, so there must be
some mental block built into the culture. Once you see this "cat,"
however, it's pretty simple and straightforward. It says that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the degree of
concentration you find
in any distribution depends on what you choose as the ranking
variable.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>If you want
to compare the concentration of value with the concentration of
acreage, you can't rank the farms by acreage and then take the top
bracket and ask what the value is. You have got to re-rank them by
value, and these are
entirely different rankings with an entirely different collection of
farms in the top bracket, and </small><small>naturally these are more valuable farms. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This reranking, farm by farm, is almost impossible to do from
published census data, which come in large groups. But I managed to
do it with some other series, and I can vouch for the fact that if you
do rewrite the data by
value, you get a higher - not a lower - degree of concentration in
terms of value than in terms of acreage.&nbsp;
</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, for those two reasons, concentration of land ownership is
not
only high but it has risen at a very rapid rate. </small><small><a

CONCLUSION
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
... <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><small><i>(11)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms. ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To sum up,
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior wealth can no longer buy in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a given number of farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gamma factors mean the higher quality land is
moving into bigger farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland
and irrigated land in vast farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising P/C ratios reflect a higher LSREV, and they mean it
is harder for a newcomer to acquire any farm acres.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been pulled up.
Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp;<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987
Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
<b>Concentration of
irrigated land</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp;<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Comparing different crops,
high values of GR go with crops
that are mostly irrigated.</i></b> For example, 85 percent of tomato
acres and 14 percent of silage corn are irrigated. For tomatoes, GR =
.91; for silage corn, GR = .52.

</i></b></small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">(26) Those who find GR
index numbers too abstract will find more meaning in these raw data.
For tomatoes, the top acreage bracket contains 1.1 percent of the
farms, 45 percent of the harvested acres, and 52 percent of the
irrigated acres in tomatoes. For silage corn, the top bracket contains
1.0 percent of the farms, 11.3 percent of the harvested acres, and 26
percent of the irrigated acres in silage corn. ...</font><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The 1940 Census of Agriculture was
the last to separate $L from
$B, overall. In 1940 the <b>building share of real estate value

lowest acreage bracket, .31 for all farms, and .12 for farms of 1,000
acres and over. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(36)</i></b></small></font></small></p>

Federal Farm Loan District," Hilgardia 3, no. 17 (1929):459-542.</font></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AELOS (1988) gives no comparable
comprehensive data, but it does
give two series that test the point and have the advantage of
disaggregation. One is for "owner-operators" and one for "landlords
with debt." For the owner-operators, ranked by acres per farm, BSREV
was .63 for farms under 10 acres; .29 for all farms; and .12 for
farms of 2,000 acres and over. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(37)

between PTR and GR is particularly
consistent and noteworthy.&nbsp; ... </i></b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small><font
 size="-2"></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. <a
