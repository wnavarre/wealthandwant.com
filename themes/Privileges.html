<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I was one day walking along
Kearney Street in San
Francisco when I noticed a crowd in front of the show window of a
store. They were looking at something inside. I took a glance myself,
but saw only a poor picture of an uninteresting landscape. As I was
turning away my eye caught these words underneath the picture: "Do you
see the cat?" I looked again and more closely, but I saw no cat. Then I
spoke to the crowd. "Gentlemen," I said, "I do not see a cat in that
picture; is there a cat there?" Some one in the crowd replied: "Naw,
there ain't no cat there. Here's a crank who says he sees a cat in it,
but none of the rest of us can." Then the crank spoke up. "I tell you,"
he said, "there is a cat there. The picture is all cat. What you
fellows take for a landscape is nothing more than a cat's outlines. And
you needn't call a man a crank either because he can see more with his
eyes than you can with yours."<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There it was, sure enough, just as
the crank had said; and the
only reason the rest of us couldn't see it was that we hadn't got the

else in the picture. The poor landscape had disappeared and a fine
looking cat had taken its place. And do you know, I was never

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a system which robs the
producers of wealth as
remorselessly and far more regularly and systematically than the
pirate robs the merchantman. Here is a system that steadily condemns
thousands to far more lingering and horrible deaths than that of
walking the plank&#8211;to death of the mind and death of the soul, as
well as death of the body. These things are undisputed. No one denies
that Irish pauperism and famine are the direct results of this land
system, and no one who will examine the subject will deny that the
chronic pauperism and chronic famine which everywhere mark our
civilization are the results of this system. Yet we are
told &#8211; nay, it seems to be taken for granted &#8211; that this system
cannot be abolished without buying off those who profit by it. Was
there ever more degrading abasement of the human mind before a

to apply it to the business of piracy? In what does the claim of the
Irish landholders differ from that of the hereditary pirate or the
man who has bought out a piratical business? "Because I have
inherited or purchased the business of robbing merchantmen," says the
pirate, "therefore respect for the rights of property must compel you
to let me go on robbing ships and making sailors walk the plank until
you buy me out."<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "Because we have
inherited or purchased the
privilege of appropriating to ourselves the <a href="../glossary.html#Lion">lion's
share</a> of the
produce of labor," says the landlord, "therefore you must continue to
let us do it, even though poor wretches shiver with cold and faint

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural.  Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of the citizen, and  political organization always starts from this base. It is as social  development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make  the many the slaves of the few. How this is we may see. In all  institutions which involve the lodgment of governing power there is,  with social growth, a tendency to the exaltation of their function and  the centralization of their power, and in the stronger of these  institutions a tendency to the absorption of the powers of the rest.  Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government the business  of a special class. And as numbers increase and the power and  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all,  so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny  and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head  man of a little village, can command or govern only by common consent,  and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his fellows. But when a  tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a populous country,  the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition, become  practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to  appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes  irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as power thus  concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of thought grows  up which regards the masses as born but for the service of their rulers.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[10] </span>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence. A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That the value attaching to land
with social growth is
intended for social needs is shown by the final proof. For refusal to
take for public purposes the increasing values that attach to land with
social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues by taxes
that lessen production, distort distribution, and corrupt society.</small></div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is thus at the basis of all

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So long as private property in
land continues &#8211; so long as
some men are treated as owners of the earth, and other men live on it

the evils of our present condition may be avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Could even the wisdom of God do
so? How could He? Should He
infuse new vigour into the sunlight, new virtue into the air; new
fertility into the soil, would not all this new bounty go to the owners

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Should He open the minds of men to
the possibilities of new
substances, new adjustments, new powers, would this do any more to
relieve poverty than steam, electricity and all the numberless

the heavens above or cause to
gush up from the subterranean depths, food, clothing &#8211; all the things
that satisfy man&#8217;s material desires to whom under our laws would all
these belong? Would not this increase and extension of His bounty
merely enable the privileged class more riotously to roll in wealth,
and bring the disinherited class to more widespread pauperism?<strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is assumed that there are in
the natural order two classes,
the rich and the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.
It is true that there are differences in capacity, in diligence, in
health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor.
The natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not
greater than are natural differences in stature. But while it is only
by selecting giants and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as
others, yet in the difference between rich and poor that exists today
we find some men richer than others by the thousand-fold and the
million-fold!</small></p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
    of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and on which
    he must draw for all that he can produce, <strong>does it not irresistibly
    follow that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others
    all
    right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged
    and the helpless?</strong> Does it not follow that those who have no rights
    to the use of land can live only by selling their power to labor to those
    who own
    the land? Does it not follow that what the socialists call &#8220;the iron
    law of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency
    of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless masses &#8212; the
    mere laborers, who of themselves have no power to use their labor &#8212; all
    the benefits of any possible advance or improvement that does not alter this
    unjust division of land? For having no power to employ themselves, they must,
    either as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for
    permission to labor. This competition with one another of men shut out from
    God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation, and must
    ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life can
    just be maintained and reproduction carried on. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>For even the philanthropy which, recognizing the evil of trying to help
    labor by alms, seeks to help men to help themselves by finding them work,
    becomes aggressive in the blind and bitter struggle that private property
    in land entails, and in helping one set of men injures others. Thus, to minimize
    the bitter complaints of taking work from others and lessening the wages
    of others in providing their own beneficiaries with work and wages, benevolent
    societies are forced to devices akin to the digging of holes and filling
    them up again. Our American societies feel this difficulty, General Booth
    encounters it in England, and the Catholic societies which your Holiness
    recommends must find it, when they are formed.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness knows of, and I am sure honors, the princely generosity of
    Baron Hirsch toward his suffering coreligionists. But, as I write, the New
    York newspapers contain accounts of an immense meeting held in Cooper Union,
    in this city, on the evening of Friday, September 4, in which a number of
    Hebrew trades-unions protested in the strongest manner against the loss of
    work and reduction of wages that are being effected by Baron Hirsch&#8217;s
    generosity in bringing their own countrymen here and teaching them to work.
    The resolution unanimously adopted at this great meeting thus concludes:</p>
  <p>We now demand of Baron Hirsch himself that he release us from his &#8220;charity&#8221; and
    take back the millions, which, instead of a blessing, have proved a curse
    and a source of misery.</p>
  <p>Nor does this show that the members of these Hebrew labor-unions &#8212; who
    are themselves immigrants of the same class as those Baron Hirsch is striving
    to help, for in the next generation they lose with us their distinctiveness &#8212; are
    a whit less generous than other men.</p>
  <p>Labor associations of the nature of trade-guilds or unions are necessarily
    selfish; by the law of their being they must fight for their own hand, regardless
    of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore the teaching of Christ that we
    should do to others as we would have them do to us, which a true political
    economy shows is the only way to the full emancipation of the masses. They
    must do their best to starve workmen who do not join them, they must by all
    means in their power force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8212; as the
    soldier in battle must shoot down his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing
    ranks. And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8212; a
    fellow-creature in all probability more pressed and starved than those who
    so bitterly denounce him, and often with the hungry pleading faces of wife
    and child behind him.</p>
  <p>I speak without prejudice against trades-unions, of which for years I was
    an active member. And in pointing out to your Holiness that their principle
    is selfish and incapable of large and permanent benefits, and that their
    methods violate natural rights and work hardship and injustice, I am only
    saying to you what, both in my books and by word of mouth, I have said over
    and over again to them. Nor is what I say capable of dispute. Intelligent
    trades-unionists know it, and the less intelligent vaguely feel it. And even
    those of the classes of wealth and leisure who, as if to head off the demand
    for natural rights, are preaching trades-unionism to working-men, must needs
    admit it.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness will remember the great London dock strike of two years ago,
    which, with that of other influential men, received the moral support of
    that Prince of the Church whom we of the English speech hold higher and dearer
    than any prelate has been held by us since the blood of Thomas &agrave; Becket
    stained the Canterbury altar.</p>
  <p>In a volume called &#8220;<em>The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike</em>,&#8221; written
    by Messrs. H. <strong>And, in so far as they succeed, what is it that trade-guilds
    and unions do but to impose more restrictions on natural rights; to create &#8220;trusts&#8221; in
    labor; to add to privileged classes other somewhat privileged classes; and
    to press the weaker closer to the wall?</strong></p>
  <p>Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
      Buxton, M.P., which advocates trades-unionism as the solution of the labor
      question, and of which a large number were sent to Australia as a sort of
      official recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers,
      I find in the summing up, on pages 164-165, the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more regular, better
            paid, and carried on under better conditions than ever before. All
        this will be an unqualified gain to those who get the benefit from it.
        But another
            result will undoubtedly be to contract the field of employment and
        lessen the number of those for whom work can be found. The lower-class
        casual
          will,
            in the end, find his position more precarious than ever before, in
        proportion to the increased regularity of work which the &#8220;fitter&#8221; of the
            laborers will secure. The effect of the organization of dock labor, as of
            all classes of labor, will be to squeeze out the residuum. The loafer, the
            cadger, the failure in the industrial race &#8212; the members of &#8220;Class
            B&#8221; of Mr. Charles Booth&#8217;s hierarchy of social classes &#8212; will
            be no gainers by the change, but will rather find another door closed
            against them, and this in many cases the last door to employment.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I am far from wishing that your Holiness should join in that pharisaical
    denunciation of trades-unions common among those who, while quick to point
    out the injustice of trades-unions in denying to others the equal right to
    work, are themselves supporters of that more primary injustice that denies
    the equal right to the standing-place and natural material necessary to work.
    What I wish to point out is that trades-unionism, while it may be a partial
    palliative, is not a remedy; that it has not that moral character which could
    alone justify one in the position of your Holiness in urging it as good in
    itself. Yet, so long as you insist on private property in land what better
    can you do? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
    <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more

      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel

      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It were unjust to censure the
proprietors of land, however, for
retaining and exercising, as they do, a right whose foundations have
not been inquired into, and whose extent no one has ever yet

that prompts their conduct; nor can they readily conceive either the
injustice or the detriment which the public suffers, by permitting such
rights to be exercised. On the other hand, the farmers and cultivators
have no clear perception of the injustice and oppression which they
suffer. They feel indeed, and they complain, but do not understand, or
dare not consider steadily, from what cause their grievances take their
rise. The oppressive rights of the one order, and the patient
submission of the other, have grown up together insensibly from remote
ages, in which the present state of human affairs could not have been

should have, that he who saves should
enjoy, is consistent with human reason and with the natural order.
But existing inequalities of wealth cannot be justified on this
ground. As a matter of fact, how many great fortunes can be
truthfully said to have been fairly earned? How many of them
represent wealth produced by their possessors or those from whom
their present possessors derived them? Did there not go to the
formation of all of them something more than superior industry and
skill? Such qualities may give the first start, but when fortunes
begin to roll up into millions there will always be found some
element of monopoly, some appropriation of wealth produced by others.
Often mere is a total absence of superior industry, skill or
self-denial, and merely better luck or greater unscrupulousness. ... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in
San Francisco recently,
leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the
other day, leaving $3,000,000.
He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Beneath all political
problems lies the social problem of
the distribution of wealth."</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of
appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Evils of
Monopolists</b></small></div>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Consider the important part in
building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor
seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are deep wrongs
in the
present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

is upheld on the ground that it is for the protection of the Irish. But, whether
under a monarchy or under a republic, is there an instance in the history of
the world in which the "protection" of the laboring masses has not meant their
oppression? The protection that those who have got the law-making power into
their hands have given labor, has at best always been the protection that man
gives to cattle &#8212; he protects them that he may use and eat them. &#8212; <em>Protection

IT is never intimated that the land-owner or the capitalist needs protection.
They, it is always assumed, can take care of themselves. It is only the poor
workingman who must be protected. What is labor that it should so need protection?
Is not labor the creator of capital, the producer of all wealth? Is it not the
men who labor that feed and clothe all others? Is it not true, as has been said,
that the three great orders of society are "workingmen, beggarmen, and thieves?" How,
then, does it come that workingmen alone need protection? &#8212; <em>Protection

WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a country which
should compel each family to keep constantly on their guard against every other
family, to expend a large part of their time and labor in preventing exchanges
with their neighbors, and to seek their own prosperity by opposing the natural
efforts of other families to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies
that laws such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families of
men who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws, as immutable
as the physical laws, each nation must stand jealously on guard against every
other nation and erect artificial obstacles to national intercourse.&#8212; <em>Protection

TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying from other
nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make a man prosperous by preventing
him from buying from other men. How this operates in the case of the individual
we can see from that practice which, since its application in the Irish land
agitation, has come to be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has
been thrust the unenviable fame of having his name turned into a verb, was in
fact "protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind built
around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act of Parliament. No
one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk or bread or meat or any
service or commodity whatever. But instead of growing prosperous, this much-protected
man had to fly from a place where his own market was thus reserved for his own
productions. What protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home
market for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain Boycott.
They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to take a certain
course is proof that it ought to take that course, and restrictions are harmful
because they restrict, and in proportion as they restrict. To assert that the
way for men to become healthy and strong is for them to force into their stomachs
what nature tries to reject, to regulate the play of their lungs by bandages,
or to control the circulation of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit
more absurd than to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them
to restrict the natural tendency to trade. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders" who
have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the full
sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax, they proposed
the only means by which the free trade principle can ever be carried to its logical
conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade but of all other forms and
modes of production, with full freedom of access to the natural element which
is essential to all production. They were the authors of the motto that in the
English use of the phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez aller!" "Clear
the ways and let things alone." This is said to come from the cry that in medieval
tournaments gave the signal for combat, The English motto which I take to come
closest to the spirit of the French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The

HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound, blindfolded, and
gagged. Shall we stand in a knot about him and discuss whether to put a piece
of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on his coat, or shall we dispute
with each other as to what road he ought to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle,
a horse and wagon, or a railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather
postpone such discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for
himself, speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
a torn coat, he may get on his feet, and if he cannot find a conveyance to suit

<p>John Dewey: <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">Steps to Economic Recovery</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Consequently instead of attempting a technical explanation of the moral and
      economic philosophy of Henry George, I want to urge my hearers to acquaint
      themselves with his own works, to study them and then to organize to see that
      his principle is carried into effect. What are the most evident sore spots
      of the present? The answer is clear. Unemployment; extreme inequality in the
      distribution of the national income; enormous fixed charges in the way of interest
      on debts; a crazy, cumbrous, inequitable tax system that puts the burden on
      the consumer, and the ultimate producer, and lets off the parasites, exploiters
      and the privileged, -- who ought to be relieved entirely of their gorged excess,
      -- very lightly, and indeed in many cases, as in that of the tariff, pays them
      a premium for imposing a burden on honest industry and on the means of production;
      a vicious and incompetent banking system, with billions of money, the hope
      for the future of millions of hard-working peoples, still locked up, while
      the depositors lose their homes and walk the streets in vain; the greater part
      of our population, in the nation of the earth most favored by nature, still
      living either in slums or in homes without the improvements indispensable to
      a healthy and civilized life.</p>
  <p>You cannot study Henry George without learning how intimately each of these
      wrongs and evils is bound up with our land system. One of our great national
      weaknesses is speculation. Everybody recognizes that fact in the stock market
      orgy of our late boom days. Only a few realize the extent to which speculation
      in land is the source of many troubles of the farmer, the part it has played
      in loading banks and insurance companies with frozen assets and compelling
      the closing of thousands of banks, nor how the high rents, the unpayable mortgages
      and the slums of the cities are connected with speculation in land values.
      All authorities on public works hold that the most fruitful field for them
      is slum clearance and better housing. Yet only a few seem to realize that with
      our present situation this improvement will put a bonus in the pockets of landlords,
      and the land speculator will be the one to profit financially--for after all,
      buildings are built on land.</p>
  <p>So with taxation. There are all sorts of tinkering going on, but the tinkers
      and patchers shut their eyes to the fact that the socially produced annual
      value of land -- not of improvements, but of ground-rent value -- is about
      five billion dollars, and that its appropriation by those who create it, the
      community, would at once relieve the tax burden and ultimately would solve
      the tax problem. Of late the federal government has concerned itself with the
      problems of home ownership, but again by methods of tinkering that may easily
      in the long run do more harm than good. The community's acquisition of its
      own creation, ground-rent value, would both reduce the price of land and entirely
      eliminate taxes on improvement, thus making ownership easier. And how anyone
      expects to solve the unemployment question by putting the sanction of both
      legality and high pecuniary reward upon the ability of the few to keep the
      many from equal access to land and to the raw material, without which labor
      is impossible, I do not see -- and no one else does. For the tinkerers assume
      that unemployment must continues, only with government assistance to those
      who are necessarily out of work. By all means let us help those that now need
      it, but for the future let us prevent the cause instead of merely mitigating
      the effects. ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>

  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    <strong>Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power,
    an unpaid-for and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding
    generations. </strong>Capital is paid for and ephemeral. <strong>Privilege
    is unpaid for and eternal.</strong> A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>
  <p><em>Q30. How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion of the current wealth that
  now flows to privilege. In other words, it would widen and deepen the channel
  of wages by enlarging opportunities for labor, and by increasing the purchasing
  power of nominal wages through reduction of prices. On the other hand it would
  narrow the channel of privilege by making the man who has a privilege pay for
  it.</p>
  <p><em>Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
  A. By the taxation of privilege.</p>
  <p><em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
  A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.</p>
  <p><em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
  A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages undiminished by taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q35. Why should land be singled out to bear the bulk of the burden of taxation?</em><br>
    A. Because in the private appropriation of the net rent of land is found
      the bulk of privilege.</p>
  <p><em>Q44. Why, on similar lots of land, should one man with a $10,000 building
    be taxed as much as another with a $100,000 building?</em><br>
    A. Because the value of the privilege of occupancy and use is the same in
    both cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is the
        largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that ground,
        or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every holder
        or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the wrong
        party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
        unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
        for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
        above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual
        landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation.</p>
  <p>One must be careful not to confuse land-value with the price of land. <strong>The
      price of land is the sum demanded for the transference from one individual
      to another of the privilege to collect and retain land-value and thus to divert
      public earnings to private pockets. <font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
        be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
        is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
        of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
        lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
        of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice?<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font><a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

Land Values</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent a
potentially important source of public
revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small><br>
<small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. </span>The community added to the market value to land by
making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.&nbsp; </small><small>... <a

government can never do and still be just:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The first of these is to take for public purposes what

  <li><small>The second is to give to private individuals or

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All wealth that is privately
produced rightfully belongs to private individuals or corporations, and
for the government to appropriate it is unjust. But land rent is
publicly produced, and for the government to give it to private
individuals or corporations is equally unjust. He who thinks himself
prepared to justify in principle the private monopolization of land
rent, must also be prepared to justify in principle the jobbery of the
Tweed Ring and the looting of Teapot Dome -- not to mention the
escapades of Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Charles Keating.</small><br>

<small>In closing, I will summarize with a quotation from the late Dr.
Viggo Starke, for many years a member of the Danish cabinet: "What I
produce is mine. All mine! What you produce is yours. All yours! But
that which none of us produced, but which we all lend value to
together, belongs by right to all of us in common." This, in a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...&nbsp; Unemployment and
underemployment of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
than competing for market success.</small></div>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In

laissez-faire capitalism. By a simple fiscal device, the revenue
arising from common property can be captured for the public treasury
and applied to the common benefit, so that government may assume

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ownership of land is thus a form of privilege.&nbsp; The word
&#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it, that is,
a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted to
do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be
&#8216;owned&#8217;, but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;, subject to a payment that
reflected the value given up by others in allowing one person to have
exclusive use of a site. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air.</span> An economy will be more efficient if
revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The justice of collecting the rent
of land can be generalized to
the justice of collecting a fee for any privilege that governments
grant to some individuals and not others. The value of the special
privilege for a few that is entailed in planning permission would be
recouped automatically in collecting the rental value of land. A

to pay to have them.

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, people who wish to devote land to golf courses do
not deserve special privileges and the expense of other members of
society. Any person or group that wishes to use land for a golf course
should be free to do so, provided that they are willing to compensate
the rest of society for the smaller amounts of land that will be
available to everyone else because they want a golf course. And the
rental value of the land that is used for the golf course measures what
is owed to the rest of society. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second part of the answer is that to the extent that
golf courses raise the value of surrounding land, it qualifies for
receipt of the increase in the rental value of surrounding land that
results from the use of the land as a golf course.... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Throughout history - and
even today - wealth and privilege has been based upon ownership of land
and monopoly. Economics, unchecked and in ignorance of the land and
rent question, remains "the caveman's law, the law of the sharpest
tooth, the angriest brow and the greediest maw." (so said Al Smith,
Governor of New York and presidential candidate during the 1920s)</small><br>

Taxable Surplus of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a>&nbsp;
(for the Duma Hearings in Moscow, 1999)<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries
are another source of value.</span>
In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these
licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.

are restricted even further or prevented from polluting entirely.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A system of quantitative controls
can be efficient if the overall
level of control is appropriate and permission to pollute is
completely transferable. But these conditions are rarely met. It is
particularly difficult to know the optimal level of pollution control
when the costs of pollution are continuous, upward sloping and not
catastrophic. And systems of quantitative controls almost always lack
fairness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They grant permanent
privileges to those who have a history
of having caused harm. If a system of quantitative controls provided
that pollution rights would be auctioned, and all the proceeds would
be collected publicly, then it would be in accord with a principle
that all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities. </span>But

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a Distinctive Factor of Production</a><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The initial distribution of land
- the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land. What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles(e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, radio, landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money. Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.&nbsp;<big> </big></small><small><a

<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>The value of a
parcel of land is initially based on the natural
endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;), created
not by an owner but by
whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
than sites in the boondocks.</span> Land values as economic values
disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
Trump.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not
guarantee
that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,
often lets public resources at &#8220;fire-sale&#8221; prices, unduly enriching
Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously
valuable licenses for TV, radio, and cell phones to GE, Disney, Time
Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting
civilization to oil) but also enrich those few who can afford to corral
them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Buying a land title &#8211; the granddaddy of all privileges &#8211;
typically
requires a mortgage, which disguises rent as &#8220;interest&#8221;. Pierre Joseph
Proudhon (1809-1865), French journalist/anarchist, noted: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"As long as land monopoly is maintained,
the few can take possession of what Nature free of charge has granted
to everyone, and usury will penetrate the whole society, and we will
have banks, which instead of being servants for the exchange of goods
will become powerful extorters."</span> He called this one; today&#8217;s
banks do bleed the economy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What does the central bank, the private consortium dubbed the
Federal
Reserve, lend to the US? Nothing. Given the power to create money by
Congress (which the Constitution had given to Congress), from no
savings at all but merely from legal
standing, it manufactures credit, which the US borrows, at interest.
The US exempts this interest from its income tax; people who hold US
bonds &#8211; mainly the wealthy &#8211; keep this income tax-free. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
much
and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Politicians
define legally &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts of polluted air and water for GM and
Monsanto, keeping safe the wealth of those responsible.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not to be outdone by any
legislature,
the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values
skyrocket near a new light rail stop. Molly Ivins wrote, </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"Henry George must be in his
grave
spinning' like a cyclotron. We, the people at large, make the land more
desirable; and then the landowners want us to pay them because we won't
allow them to poison the air or to pollute the rivers." (1995 March)<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
That&#8217;s how great fortunes are made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). </span>Land titles,
corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. </span>Thus laws
(&#8220;privilege&#8221;

Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public,
governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
</span>Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are
not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now wipe out the taxes,

retention. Instead, replace all that with running government like a

replace license with responsibility ("internalize the

<p>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to landowners.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege.
<strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the firm has
a charter from a government.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
others.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small><small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read the whole

Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE Land Question is not merely
a question between farmers and the
owners of agricultural land. It is a question that affects every man,
every woman, and every child. The Land Question is simply another
name for the great labor question, and the people who think of the
Land Question as having importance simply for farmers forget what
land is.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If you would realize what land
is, think of what men would be
without land. <strong>...</strong> </small><br>
<br>
<small>NOW, as to the rights of ownership -- as to that principle which
enables a man to say of any certain thing --"This is mine; it is my
property" -- where does that come from? If you look you will see that
it comes from the right of the producer to the thing which he
produces. What a man makes he can justly claim to be his. Whatever
any individual, by the exercise of his powers, takes from the
reservoirs of nature, molds into shapes fitted to satisfy human
needs, that is his; to that a just and sacred right of property
attaches. That is a right based on the right of the individual to
improvement, the right to the enjoyment of his own powers, to the
possession of the fruits of his exertions. That is a sacred right, to
violate which is to violate the sacred command, "Thou shalt not
steal." There is the right of ownership. Now that right, which gives
by natural and Divine laws, the thing produced to him whose exertion
has produced it, which gives to the man who builds a house the right
to that house, to the man who raises a crop the right to that crop,
to the man who raises a domestic animal a right to that domestic
animal-how can that right attach to the reservoirs of nature? How can
that right attach to the earth itself? </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>WE start out with these two principles, which I think are
clear
and self-evident: </b></small><small><b></b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>that which a man makes belongs to him and can by
him be given or sold to anyone that he pleases. 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>But that which existed
before man came upon the earth, that which was not produced by man,
but which was created by God -- that belongs equally to all men.&nbsp;</b></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As
no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in the
land.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We say that all the social
difficulties we see here, all the
social difficulties that exist in England or Scotland, all the social
difficulties that are growing up in the United States-- 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the lowness
of wages, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the scarcity of employment, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the fact that though labor is
the producer of wealth, yet everywhere the laboring class is the poor
class</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>--are all due to one great
primary wrong, that wrong which makes
the natural element necessary to all, the natural element that was
made by the Creator for the use of all, the property of some of the
people, that great wrong that in every civilized country disinherited
the mass of men of the bounty of their Creator. What we aim at is not
the increase in the number of a privileged class, not making some
thousands of earth owners into some more thousands. No, no; what we
aim at is to secure the natural and God-given right to the humblest
in the community--to secure to every child born in Ireland, or in any
other country, his natural right to the equal use of his native
land. 
    <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>THE way to secure equality is plain. It is not by dividing
the
land; it is by calling upon those who are allowed possession of
pieces of land giving special advantage to pay to the whole
community, the rest of the people, aye, and including themselves--to
the whole people, a fair rent or premium for that privilege, and
using the fund so obtained for the benefit of the whole people.
</b>What we would do would be to make the whole people the general
landlord, to have whatever rent is paid for the use of land to go,
not into the pockets of individual landlords, but into the treasury
of the general community, where it could be used for the common
benefit.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>True we are
confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. Now one
of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for
the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I
do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
that time a most important <b>third way</b>, and that is the way we
advocate.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what
we call the single tax. We
propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone -- not
upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
a house.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that rent is a natural
thing. So it is. Where one man, all
rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than
another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the
difference. Where one man has a piece of land and others have none,
it gives him a special advantage; it is only fair that he should pay
into the common fund the value of that special privilege granted him
by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BUT over and above the economic
rent there is the power that comes
by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.</span>
But if one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to
hold
land idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up
land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest
landowners could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere
that simple plan would compel the landowner either to use his land or
to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of land would then
fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege it
gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be
used for the benefit of the whole community. <a

<br>
The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Whole People the True
Owners of the Land.</b>
</small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When, therefore, a
privileged class arrogantly claims a right of
private property in the land of a country, that claim is simply
unintelligible, except in the broad principle that the land of a
country is not a free gift at all, but solely a family inheritance;</span>
that it is not a free gift which God has bestowed on His creatures,
but an inheritance which he has left to His children; that they,
therefore, being God's eldest sons, inherit this property by right of
succession; that the rest of the world have no share or claim to it,
on the ground that origin is tainted with the stain of illegitimacy.
The world, however, will hardly submit to this shameful imputation of
its own degradation, especially when it is not sustained by even a
shadow of reason.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I infer, therefore, that no
individual or class of individuals can
hold a right of private property in the land of a country; that the
people of that country, in their public corporate capacity, are, and
always must be, the real owners of the land of their country --
holding an indisputable title to it, in the fact that they received
it as a free gift from its Creator, and as a necessary means for
preserving and enjoying the life He has bestowed upon them.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Price of Land a Monopoly
Price.</b>
</small><br>
<small>This privileged class not merely sells the use of God's gifts,
but
extorts for them a price which is most unjust and exorbitant; in
fact, they hardly ever sell them at less than scarcity or famine
prices. If a man wants to buy a suit of broadcloth, the price he will
be required to pay for it will amount to very little more than what
it cost to produce it -- and yet that suit of clothes may be a
requirement of such necessity or utility to him that he would
willingly pay three times the amount it actually cost rather than
submit to the inconvenience of doing without it. On the other hand,
the manufacturer would extort the last shilling he would be willing
to give for it, only that he knows there are scores of other
manufacturers ready to undersell him if he demanded much more than
the cost of its production. The price, therefore, of commodities of
all kinds that can be produced on a large scale, and to an indefinite
extent, will depend on the cost required to produce them, or at least
that part of them which is produced at the highest expense. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small><b>The Landlord the Greatest Burden on the Land.</b></small><br>
<small>The land is a commodity that strictly belongs to this class. It
is
limited in extent, and no human power can enlarge or extend its area.
The competition for it is excessive, the competitors struggling for
its attainment -- not for the purpose of satisfying a taste for the
fine arts, or to gratify a passion for the rare or beautiful, but to
secure a necessary means of existence: for they must live on and by
the land, or they cannot live at all. The owner, therefore, of that
land can put on it any rent he pleases, and the poor people competing
for it have no choice but to accept his terms or die in a ditch or a
poorhouse. Under the present system of Land Tenure, the owners are
not only enabled, but actually exact for the use of the land the last
shilling the tenant is able to pay, leaving him only what is barely
sufficient to keep him from dying. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The essential and immutable
principles of justice used certainly
to be: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That everyone had a right of
property in the hard-earned fruits of
his labour; that whatever property a man had made by the expenditure
of his capital, his industry and his toil, was really his own; that
he, and he alone, had a right to all the benefits, the advantages and
enjoyments that that property yielded; and that if anyone else
meddled with that property against his will, or interfered with him
in its enjoyment, he was thereby guilty of the crimes of theft and of
robbery, which the eternal law of God, as well as the laws of all
nations, reprobated and punished with such severity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the principles which underlie
the existing system of Land
Tenure, and which impart to it its specific and distinctive
character, are exactly the reverse of these. The principles on which
that system is based are: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That one privileged class do not
require to labour for their
livelihood at all: that they have an exclusive right to all the
advantages, comforts and enjoyments that can be derived from a
splendid property, which exacted no patient, painful or self-denying
efforts of labour to create it or acquire it, and which, in fact,
they inherited without any sacrifice at all: that, being a singularly
favoured race, and being all God's eldest sons, the rest of the world
must humbly acknowledge themselves to be their inferiors in rank,
lineage, condition and dignity: that this superiority of rank gives
them a right to sell out God's gifts as if they were purely the
products of their own labour and industry, and that they can exact in
exchange for them famine or scarcity prices. Finally, that they enjoy
the enviable privilege of appropriating the hard-earned property of
others against their wills, and do them no wrong even if they charge
them a rent for the use of what would really appear to be their
own. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

10 million people. In fact, they bought the market, at a cost of
about $17 per person.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Well, I used to listen to WNIB,
and I resented being sold for $17.
I wanted to look into the business of broadcast radio, and try to
analyse it in Georgist terms. George pointed out that those who could
monopolize natural opportunities could exact a toll on users, and
that speculation could lead to excessive costs of access which
eventually make productive use impossible.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I found is, first, that the
major asset of broadcasters is
privilege. Actually, I could have figured that out just by reading
the Chicago Tribune<font size="-2"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font>,
who quoted
the publisher of a radio trade magazine: &#8220;These radio stations
are a license to steal. They&#8217;re gushing oil wells.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, second, I found that
speculation in broadcast licenses does
indeed appear to have reached a point where productive activity is
quite difficult, though not yet impossible. <span

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... near me is a beautiful
parkway which runs about 40 miles. For most of
its length, it is a rather straight highway. But near its western end,
the straight road has some huge curves, designed to take it around some
properties which the builders of the highway did not seek to acquire
via eminent domain after the owners chose not to sell. Every driver who
uses the westernmost section of the Merritt Parkway must drive extra
miles in order to protect those wealthy 1930s landholders and their
successors. I estimate that at least 1.3 <em>billion</em> extra miles have been
driven by the general public. Had the builders of the parkway exercised
eminent domain, this mileage, and the pollution and expense involved,
would have been saved. Instead, the costs are shifted onto every driver
and onto the taxpayers who maintain the highway and its services.
Eminent domain would, I think, have been an appropriate step to prevent
that. Today, the properties are among the most valuable residences in
Connecticut, but their owners don't compensate the rest of us for our
inconvenience and expense.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>The galleys that carried Caesar to Britain, the accoutrements of his legionaries,
      the baggage that they carried, the arms that they bore, the buildings that
      they erected; the scythed chariots of the ancient Britons, the horses that
      drew them, their wicker boats and wattled houses&#8211;where are they now?
      But the land for which Roman and Briton fought, there it is still. That
      British soil is yet as fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans.
      Generation
      after generation has lived on it since, and generation after generation
      will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference. The right to
      possess
      and to pass on the ownership of things that in their nature decay and soon
      cease to be is a very different thing from the right to possess and to
      pass on the ownership of that which does not decay, but from which each
      successive
      generation must live.</p>
  <p>To show how this difference between land and such other species of property
      as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for the vested rights
      of landholders, let me illustrate again.</p>
  <p> Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a business of sailing the seas, capturing
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes.
    In this way he accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried.
    But let us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
    his wealth,
    but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs and so on, until
    at the present day this wealth or a part of it has come to a great-great-grandson
    of
    Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
    that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the shipmasters whom
    Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says: "This man's great-great-grandfather
    plundered my great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which
    have been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would have
    been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
    restore them." What would society answer?</p>
  <p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with principles
    recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We cannot entertain such
    a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's great-great-grandfather robbed your
    great-great-grandfather, and that as the result of this wrong he has got
    things that otherwise might have come to you. But we cannot inquire into
    occurrences
    that happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to
    its own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the controversies
    of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless disputes and pretexts
    for dispute. What you say may be true, but somewhere we must draw the line,
    and have an end to strife. Though this man's great-great-grandfather may
    have
    robbed your great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into
    possession of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully, and
    we must take
    this peaceful possession, when it has been continued for a certain time,
    as absolute evidence of just title; for, were we not to do that, there would
    be
    no end to dispute and no secure possession of anything."</p>
  <p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the statute
    of limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> This is the reason why it is held &#8211; and as
      to most things held justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for
      a certain time cures all defects of title.</span></p>
  <p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
  <p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and profitable
    piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son, and so on, until
    the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has come to consider it the most
    natural thing in the world that his ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much
    plunder, whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
    great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to work. But
    at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having their ships sunk
    and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of trembling for their lives every
    time a sail lifts above the horizon, and they demand of society that piracy
    be stopped.</p>
  <p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed to the
    doctrine of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound to prevent
    any interference
      with the business that he had inherited, and that, if it wanted him to
    stop, it must buy him out, paying him all that his business was worth&#8211;that
      is to say, at least as much as he could make in twenty years' successful
    pirating, so that if he stopped pirating he could still continue to live
    in luxury off
      of the profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
  <p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be but one answer.
    We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd that his was a business to
    which the statute of limitations and the doctrine of vested rights did not
    apply; that because his father, and his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather
    pursued the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the plank,
    was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it. Society, we will all
    agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy and stop it at once, and that
    without getting a cent for stopping.</p>
  <p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his piratical business
    to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree that society ought to say that
    their purchase of the business gave them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
  <p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe, I do not
    ask what society would say.</p>
  <p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied that,
    under the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for a long time
    say what
      we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would all the Kidds loudly claim
    that to make them give up their business without full recompense would be
    a wicked
      interference with vested rights, but the justice of this claim would at
    first be assumed as a matter of course by all or nearly all the influential
    classes &#8211; the
      great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for the magazines, the
    eloquent clergymen, and the principal professors in the principal universities.
    Nay,
      even the merchants and sailors, when they first began to complain, would
    be so tyrannized and browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly
      think of more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there
    any
      one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and without
      compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being stigmatized as
    a reckless disturber and wicked foe of social order.</p>
  <p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such fools, then I
    appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
  <p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any people,
    became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to you the truth of
    what I say. ...</p>
  <p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is not long since
    the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly respectable business, affording
    as legitimate an opening for the investment of capital and the display of enterprise
    as any other. The proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous,
    then as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very Constitution
    bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law of the nation, adopted
    twelve years after the enunciation of the Declaration of Independence, declare
    that for twenty years the slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted?
    Such dominion had the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who
    had already proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

  <p><em><strong>d. Equality</strong></em></p>
  <p>In respect of the fourth maxim the single tax bears more equally&#8212; that
    is to say, more justly &#8212; than any other tax. It is the only tax that
    falls upon the taxpayer in proportion to the pecuniary benefits he receives
    from the public; 29 and its tendency, accelerating with the increase of the
    tax, is to leave every one the full fruit of his own productive enterprise
    and effort. 30</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>29 The benefits of government are not the only
          public benefits whose value attaches exclusively to land. Communal
          development from whatever cause produces the same effect. But as it
          is under the protection of government that land-owners are able to
          maintain ownership of land and through that to enjoy the pecuniary
          benefits of advancing social conditions, government confers upon them

        to the expenses of the state? Evidently not. The income of the one represents
        wealth he creates and adds to the general wealth of the state; the income
        of the other represents merely wealth that he takes from the general
        stock, returning nothing.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book

    </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q18. How would you reach the bondholder, or the man with money alone?</em><br>
    A. Why should we wish to reach him if his bonds or his money represent labor
      products to which he has honestly acquired a just title? This question
      is a legitimate offspring of the plundering theory that men should be taxed
      according to their ability to pay, the merits of which are considered on
      pages 7-9. It is a question which may also have been suggested by the fact
      that &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; are so often
      men who have special privileges which coin money for them. There is a feeling
      that it would be unfair to allow such special privileges to escape taxation.
      It would be. But inquiry will show that the most important of these privileges
      rest in the ownership of land, and that the &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men
      of money&quot; whom the questioner probably has in mind, are in fact great
      landlords; that is to say, that their fortunes are really based upon land.
      When land values were taxed, the great source of unearned incomes &#8212; land
      monopoly &#8212; would be practically abolished, and bondholders and men
      of money would be only those who earn what they have. Such property no
      man of honest instincts should wish to expropriate. </p>
  <p><em>Q56. Rich man with large mansion; poor widow with small house on same
      sized lot adjoining. The two pay the same tax. Is that right?</em><br>
A. There is no reason in justice why the community should not charge poor widows
as much for monopolizing valuable land as it charges rich men. In either case
it confers a special privilege and should be paid what the privilege is worth.
The question is seldom asked in good faith. Poor widows who live on lots adjoining
large mansions are not numerous, and when they exist they are simply land-grabbers.
In our sympathy for these widows, let us not forget the vast armies of widows
who not only do not live next to mansions, but have no place in the whole wide
world upon which to rest. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Private%20Possession.html">Private Possession
      as an Alternative to Rental and Private Ownership for Agricultural Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Market
    Determination of the Sizes of Farms</b></p>
  <p>When systems of private ownership are discussed, limitations on the sizes
    of private farms are often proposed. The rationale for such limits is that
    there is not enough land for everyone to have as much as they want, so no one
    should be allowed to have an excessive amount. Such a rationale makes sense,
    however, only if people with much land have a special privilege, while those
    with little or no land are unfairly deprived. Under a system of private possession,
    the possession of a large amount of land would not make a person privileged.
    It means that the possessor would be obliged to pay a proportionately larger
    amount of rent year after year. And the person with little or no land is not
    deprived, because he can obtain as much land as he wishes by paying a purchase
    price corresponding to the value of the improvements to the land, plus a monthly
    price to the government of the rental value of the land. Therefore, under a
    system of private possession, it is sensible to have no severe restrictions
    on the amount of land that a person can possess. Farms will be of whatever
    sizes are most efficient. Those who are highly capable managers of land will
    tend to have very large farms. Those who are less capable or less experienced
    will tend to have smaller farms. If technological advances change the optimal
    sizes of farms, people would make corresponding changes in the sizes of holdings
    without any prompting from governments. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Private%20Possession.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... Indeed, if we try to envision, in view of our present location this
    afternoon, &quot;The
      World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world
      of tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed
      into
      barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom which
      Henry George taught. The principles to which I refer are:</p>
  <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these rights
      may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction between
      what is justly private property because it has relation to individual initiative
      and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property because
      it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose value is
      created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some governmental
      privilege or franchise.</p>
  <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should be abolished
      as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly for private
      monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact that even where
      a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated in the public interests,
      it should be operated as a result of cooperation between the representatives
      of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by the politicians who control
      the political state.</p>
  <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created and
      perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish monopoly,
      they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot grant the privileges
      which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences by invoking anti-trust
      laws against them.</p>
  <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions which
      it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting a vital
    function which it should and can perform &#8212; the function of collecting
    public revenues, as far as possible, from those who reap the benefits of
    natural resources.
      In view of public and social needs, it is remarkable that no effort has
    been made by governments to reduce the tax burdens on labor and capital,
    which are
      engaged in increasing production, by transferring them to those who restrict
      production by making monopoly privileges special to themselves.</p>
  <p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
      forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value, is
      a task within the competency of government if it really desires to accomplish
      it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    Similarly, in the early capitalist era, land, resources, and places to dump
      wastes were abundant; aggregated capital was the scarcest factor. That&#8217;s
      why rules and practices developed that put capital above all else. In the
      twenty-first century, however, this is no longer the case. As economist
      Joshua Farley has noted, &#8220;If we want more fish on our dinner plates,
      the scarce factor isn&#8217;t fishing boats, it&#8217;s fish. If we want
      more timber, the scarce factor isn&#8217;t sawmills, it&#8217;s trees.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As a businessman and investor, I&#8217;ve benefited personally from the
    primacy of capital and am not keen to end it. But as a citizen, I have to
    recognize that times have changed. The world is awash with capital, most
    of it devoted to speculation. By contrast, healthy ecosystems are increasingly
    scarce. If anything deserves priority, it&#8217;s nature&#8217;s capital,
    yet capitalism rolls on with financial capital as its king.</p>
  <p>I should note that my numbering of capitalism&#8217;s stages isn&#8217;t
    meant to be definitive. I&#8217;ve heard some people say that capitalism
    has had three stages, and others that it&#8217;s had four. Such counts are
    inevitably arbitrary. The point I wish to make is that capitalism changes.
    It&#8217;s rigid in the sense that those who are privileged have plenty of
    power with which to protect their privileges, but it&#8217;s not immutable.

    particular asset. These assorted privileges can be bundled or unbundled almost
    any which way.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s largely through property rights that economies are shaped. Feudal
    economies were based on estates passed from lords to their eldest sons, alongside
    commons that sustained the commoners. Commoners were required, in one way
    or another, to labor for the lords, while the lords lived off that labor
    and the bounty of the land. The whole edifice was anchored by the so-called
    divine right of kings.</p>
  <p>Similarly, capitalism is shaped by the property rights we create and honor
    today. Its greatest invention has been the web of property rights we call
    the <em>joint stock corporation</em>. This fictitious entity enjoys perpetual life,
    limited liability, and &#8212; like the feudal estate of yesteryear &#8212; almost
    total sovereignty. Its beneficial ownership has been fractionalized into
    tradeable shares, which themselves are a species of property.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires them
    to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example, set
    up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of future
    generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares of Pacific
    Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to preserve the
    forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned some of these rights,
    Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s) would have ended more
    happily. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>The question of who gets the top right in any society is always an interesting
    one. Invariably, the top dogs in any era assert that there&#8217;s no alternative.
    Kings said it three hundred years ago; capital owners say it today. They
    hire priests and economists to add moral or pseudoscientific credence to
    their claims. The truth, though, is that societies choose their top right
    holders, and we can change our minds if we wish.... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Second, we should demand more birthrights and property rights than we have
    now. Rights that belong to everyone. Rights built into our operating system.
    Rights that protect future generations as well as our own. The reason I stress
    property rights is that, in America, property rights are sacred. They&#8217;re
    guaranteed by the Constitution. Once you have them, they can&#8217;t be taken
    without fair compensation. These protections have greatly benefited those
    who own private property. They should also benefit those who share common
    wealth. ....</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s also nice about the new operating system is that, once installed,
    it can&#8217;t be easily removed. That&#8217;s because it relies on property
    rights rather than government programs that are subject to political ebb
    and flow. If you have any doubt about this, consider the staying power of
    Social Security and the Alaska Permanent Fund, both of which distribute periodic
    payments that have attained the status of property rights. Social Security
    is over seventy years old and has never been cut once; in 2005, it survived
    a privatization campaign led by President Bush. Similarly, the Alaska Permanent
    Fund, now more than twenty-five years old, repelled an attempt in 1999 to
    divert part of its income to the state treasury.</p>
  <p>This third version of capitalism is a logical successor to the first two.
    In Capitalism 1.0 we had a shortage of goods, in Capitalism 2.0 a surplus.
    In Capitalism 3.0 we&#8217;ll have plenty, but not too much. We&#8217;ll
    have more things we truly need &#8212; healthier ecosystems, communities,
    culture &#8212; and fewer thneeds. We&#8217;ll have a proper balance between
    our &#8220;me&#8221; and our &#8220;we&#8221; sides. We&#8217;ll be more
    connected and less isolated, more secure and less stressed. Overall, I&#8217;d
    venture, we&#8217;ll be happier.</p>
  <p>We&#8217;ll have some new traffic rules on this road. Rights now enjoyed
    exclusively by private capital will be matched, or even trumped, by rights
    held in trust for future generations. Similarly, the ability of private wealth
    owners to receive income and inheritances will be matched by the ability
    of everyone to receive them. And risks we now face individually, such as
    illness, will be tempered by shared risk pools that exclude no one.</p>
  <p>The biggest change will be in the third algorithm I described in chapter
    4: the price of nature will no longer be zero. Instead, the price of nature &#8212; or
    at least, of the scarcest and most endangered parts of nature &#8212; will
    gradually rise. This will compel corporations (and consumers) to internalize
    many of the costs they now externalize. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
