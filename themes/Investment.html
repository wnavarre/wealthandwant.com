    Estate and the Capital Gains Debate</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.<small><span

 style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS MISSING
FROM THE CAPITAL GAINS DEBATE?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The most frequently
heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span> </small><br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span> </small><br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small><font size="-1">14 Some argue that
eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock
market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Typical of the campaign to reduce capital gains taxes is a Wall
Street
Journal editorial, &#8220;Capital Gains: Lift the Burden.&#8221; Author W. Kurt
Hauser argues that when the capital gains tax rate was increased from
20 percent to 28 percent in 1989, the effect was to deter asset sales,
causing a decline in the capital gains to be reaped and taxed. He
refers, however, only to stock market gains, and specifically, to
equity in small businesses. Citing the example of yacht producers, he
suggests that taxing capital gains on stocks issued by these businesses
&#8220;locks in&#8221; capital asset sales, thereby deterring new investment and
hiring, and reducing the supply of yachts.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Others contend that new productive investment is relatively
insensitive
to capital gains tax rates, arguing, for example, that most of the
money placed in venture-capital funds come from tax-exempt pension
funds, endowments, and foundations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17 </span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What
is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></small><a

      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
      One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to use it.
      Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability to
      control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from the
      increase in its price. <strong>With most of the geo-rent tapped for public revenue,
      the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the economy, since
      with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land would instead go
      to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide better training.</strong></p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If a
      landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to pass
      on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would be invisible
      to renters, the link between using public services and paying for them would
      be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent, so that link
      is there. If government revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not generate
      rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce land
      value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue would come from the
      landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no different than the situation
      today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no property tax, and typically
      they get government assistance. This is an argument not against the use of
      rent, but in favor of privatizing government programs. In the private sector,
      the link between ownership and control is stronger. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The Partiality of
    Indexing Capital Gains</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We surely agree with Roberts et
al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. Here, however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To handle this matter we need two
semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth (although it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>]</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To
signalize these differences I use the present participle "investing,"
rather than the ambiguous noun "investment."&nbsp;<b> </b><i
 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span><b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every Keynesian also knew in 1961
that investment means net,
positive-sum investing. It does not include buying and selling
existing assets like land: these are zero-sum transactions,
macro-economically non-functional and barren. [Keynes, although
careless of consistency, generally took care to distinguish old and new
assets. " ... the competition of a high interest-rate on mortgages may
well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of wealth from
current investment in newly produced capital-assets as high interest
rates on long-term debts ... " <small>[<i>General Theory, 1936, p.
241.] The old macro-economists generally refer to investing in newly
produced assets as "income- creating expenditure," which is clear and
correct, but too much of a mouthful.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I use "investing" only
in the sense of net, income-creating, job-making spending.<small> [<i>Note
the difference between real turnover and mere ownership turnover.
Ownership turnover generates no income (except for brokers and M&amp;A
personnel) and creates no capital. Real turnover also creates no
capital, but does forward supplies of goods to consume, and flows of
investing to produce replacement goods. Most of gross investing is
reinvesting funds received or anticipated from sales of old capital
(including inventories, which turn fast, and "fixed" capital which
turns slowly as it depreciates and the funds are reinvested).</i>]<b>
</b></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.&nbsp; ... <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
    for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Consequences
    of Foreseeable Increases in Rental Value</b></p>
  <p>If the value of a site is expected to rise in the future, bidders for the
    current use of the site will take that into account in their current offers.
    A potential user who wishes to make long-lasting improvements to the site,
    of a sort that cannot take full advantage of the future higher value of the
    site, will offer less for the site this year than if the site did not have
    future prospects that will raise future offers from competing uses. On the
    other hand, a potential user who wishes to use a site as something like a parking
    lot, requiring very little in durable improvements, will be virtually unconcerned
    with the prospect of higher future rents. Thus, to the extent that bidders
    can foresee future bids, sites where optimal use requires a change in use in
    the near future to achieve greatest efficiency will tend to be acquired by
    users who can relinquish use without suffering loss.</p>
  <p>Of course, the future cannot be seen perfectly. People will sometimes experience
    losses as a result of unanticipated rises in the rent of the land under their
    durable improvements. To compensate for this risk, people who wish to use land
    for durable improvements will reduce, to some extent, their bids for land.
    They may also seek to purchase insurance against rent increases, just as they
    now purchase fire insurance.<font size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font> The practice
    of setting each year's rent at the amount that someone is willing to pay in
    that year for the use of a similar site ensures that some profit-oriented person
    (either the investor or the seller of insurance) has an incentive to estimate
    carefully the opportunity cost of a site in future years before the site is
    committed for a long span of time to a particular durable improvement. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read
