and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We tend to have a very romantic conception of land, in this day and age. I'm
    not sure why, but I suspect it has to do with how seldom modern people actually
    come into contact with the stuff of the earth itself. We deal with burgers...
    papers... toilets... Without thinking about the many layers of processing between
  hayfield and burger, between tree and paper, between flush and water table. </p>
  <p> We think of dropping out of the modern plastic world to go &quot;back to
    the land.&quot; &quot;The land&quot; is where we go on camping trips.</p>
  <p> This romantic conception of land can lead to some dangerously fuzzy thinking.
      It leads us to think, for example, that perhaps land used to be absolutely
      vital to human life, back in some halcyon, underpopulated past &#8212; but
      modern technology has long since taken care of that.</p>
  <p>Or has it?</p>
  <p> Let's think about this question: what is our most valuable natural resource?
    Is it<br>
&#8212; gold, diamonds, precious or strategic minerals? Nope, not even close.<br>
&#8212; Oil? Well, it's highly important to industrial civilization, of course,
  a matter of great political import &#8212; but by no means the most valuable.<br>
&#8212; Water? Now we're getting closer: necessary for life, to be sure, and
  thus a potential object of wars &#8212; but in terms of cost per cubic foot,
  not so terribly high, yet. </p>
  <p>What is it? Our most valuable natural resource &#8212; by leaps and bounds,
    more valuable than all the others combined &#8212; is urban land. Our most
    valuable natural resource is land whose natural fertility is utterly depleted,
    it will yield no gems or minerals; its soil is full of toxins. There's nothing
    worthwhile about it, except for one vital attribute: where it is.</p>
  <p> Technology has continually reduced the amount of land that each person
    needs to survive. But, of course, we do more, economically, than merely survive &#8212; and
      human society has continually demanded more land for all the stuff that
    people produce: all the gewgaws, gimcracks, thingamabobs and widgets...</p>
  <p>It takes a whole bunch of land to produce &#8212; and transport, and merchandise &#8212; all
    that stuff. Nowadays we hear a lot about the concept of the ecological footprint:
    the overall area of land and resources needed to support a certain industry,
    say, or a certain region. The grossly huge <strong>ecological footprint</strong> of
    many communities (the United States, for example) leads to hand-wringing
    about overpopulation &#8212; goodness
    gracious, what if all the people in China and India start wanting to consume
    as much as we do!</p>
  <p>We can analyze the ecological footprint in terms of its three distinct components: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the subsistence footprint (what we must have to stay alive &#8212; which,
          as I said, tends to	shrink with human progress)</li>
    <li> the wealth footprint (the resources needed to make the stuff we want,
          over and above what	we actually need)</li>
    <li>the <strong>illth</strong> footprint (&quot;illth&quot; is a very useful
        term coined by ecologist and social philosopher Ralph Borsodi. It refers
        to the resources that are squandered on things we neither want nor need:
        pollution, waste, weapons, crime, preventable disease and malnutrition) <strong>...</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>If we just look at the &quot;ecological footprint,&quot; it's easy to be scared
    of the seemingly unavoidable damage we are doing to the earth. But seeing &quot;the
    footprint&quot; in terms of its components &#8212; subsistence, wealth, and
    illth &#8212; makes it clear that the fact of persistent and growing global
    poverty is not the inevitable result of population growth. I believe it&#8217;s
    true that the world cannot long support current levels of pollution, waste
    and habitat destruction &#8212; but these problems spring not from production
    itself &#8212; and certainly not from trade, itself &#8212; but from privileges,
    granted to individuals and corporations &#8212; things that we can correct,
  if we choose to.</p>
  <p> To solve the problem of land and justice is to remove unjust privilege, by
    instituting an economic system that rewards production and prohibits extortion. </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s all about the land: not only is land necessary for all life &#8212; land
    is also necessary for all production. So, as human population increases,
    and as the production of wealth gets more and more efficient, the demand
    for land
    goes up, and, of course, the land factories start cranking out more land!</p>
  <p> Wait! They can't DO that, can they? </p>
  <p> Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by human
    beings. If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers
    will make
    more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot
    be increased. If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen:
    its
    price will go up. </p>
  <p>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
      no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an
    immediate need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait,
    because they
      expect the land's value to increase with time.</p>
  <p> That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem
    of poverty. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

  Jeff Smith: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
automobile.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Noticing rent, realizing its
social nature, accepting that it's to
be shared, and understanding that wages and interest should not be
expropriated, for most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking
such thoughts leads to a new way of conceiving economics, too.
Ecological economics becomes not just a branch of economics but a
whole new discipline, needing a new name. In geonomics we maintain
the distinction between items bearing exchange value that come into
being by human effort - wealth - and those that don't - land. Keeping
this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious and
non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that
hoarding land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy
land plus buildings engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is
quasi-rent, that the cost of land inflates faster than the price of
produced goods and services, that over half of corporate profit, says
the Urban Land Institute, is from real estate. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Summing up these analyses, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomists offer a Grand Unifying
Theory, that the flow of rent pulls all other indicators in its wake.
</span>Geonomics differs from economics as chemistry from alchemy, as
astronomy from astrology. The acid test of any science is prediction,
a test that economics fails and geonomics passes. Plugging in the
land price cycle of 17+ years lets geonomists crank out predictions
more accurate than those generated by "the experts" who missed, for
example, the collapse of mighty Japan. When the land of the Rising
Sun was on the market for four times the assessed value of all
America, that's when a few geonomists, like voices in the wilderness,
countered conventional wisdom by proclaiming that the Japanese boom
would bust. According to these geonomic prognosticators, don't expect
America's next downturn for at least another five years, despite the
tech wreck or any other stock market fluctuations. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To sustain that which we love, we
must transform our relationships
to nature, to government, and to each other. We need to become
geonomists in worldview, theory, discipline, and policy. Geonomics
creates an economy that's not at war with but aligned with the
natural world. ...&nbsp; <a

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>It is far easier to
outline the basic premises of Georgist economics
than it is to do so for the emerging field of ecological economics.
Georgism is a tradition that grew out of a clearly formed tradition of
19th century classical economics and has been refined further for the
past century. It was neoclassical economics that diverged from the
reigning orthodoxy. The differences between the classical tradition as
represented and defended by Henry George and the emerging neoclassical
school were vividly portrayed from their earliest divergence, even to
the staging of formal debates between George and the new orthodoxy&#8217;s
adherents. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">75</span></small>
In contrast, ecological economics along with other emerging heterodox
schools is itself very much a reaction to the neoclassical tradition&#8217;s
insensitivities and failures. The differences between ecological
economics and the floundering discipline of neoclassical economics are
as much by way of the former&#8217;s criticism of the latter as they are an
enunciation of clear starting points.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To be sure, neoclassical economics emerged gradually over a
period of
some fifty years, and only reached its heyday, one might argue, with
the arrival of Paul Samuelson. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Samuelson, the
MIT economist whose text has gone through some 16 editions and has
outsold all other text combined once said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who writes a
nation&#8217;s laws . . . if I can write its economics textbooks.&#8221; </span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">76</span></small> The
neoclassical position developed ever greater abstract mathematical
applications, with models ever more detached from &#8220;real world&#8221; market
forces. This system of analysis now has reached a point of questionable
utility due to its hermetic and Newtonian emulations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">77 </span></small>Little
by little, one premise and formula after another have been cast aside,
to a point now that there is a broad recognition among economic
theorists at least that the discipline faces an intellectual crisis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">78</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">75This history
        is well
chronicled in Mason Gaffney, The Corruption of Economics, London:

<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Without
enumerating further criticisms that have been
levied against neoclassical economic thinking, something that has been
done far better elsewhere than is possible here, suffice it to say that
some of the most compelling charges have been made by the ecological
economists.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">79</span></small>
The most trenchant one as explicated by economist Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen is its violation of the basic laws of physics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">80 </span></small>It
assumes a continuing draw-down of the earth&#8217;s store of energy, of which
there is, of course, only a finite amount. If the economy continues to
expand to include all elements of the earth, it will consume so many
resources, particularly energy resources, that ultimately life itself
is destroyed. One study calculated that if everyone in the world lived
at the level of the average American, three &#8220;earths&#8221; would be necessary
to accommodate us all. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">81</span></small> The
challenge, argue the ecological economists, is to structure economic
analysis and the economy itself in such a way that markets are
contained and that existence outside economic reach is respected and
preserved. Whereas other studies of the environment within the
framework of conventional neoclassical economics attempt to price
nature in a way that its value is assured, ecological economists work
from the conviction that such an approach is questionable if not
futile, as it can never achieve any accurate and reliable market values
for such existence.<small><span

</small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central premise of ecological
economics is a recognition that market
prices do not reflect the value of commodities, particularly the
resources and services of nature. Oscar Wilde first noted&nbsp;that
a cynic was &#8220;a man who knows the price of everything and the value of
nothing.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">83</span>
But it is clearly not only cynics who hold such ideas today. The
growing &#8220;commodification&#8221; of all things &#8212; the consequence of a gradual
and inexorable privatization of the whole world and the ever expanding
attempts to include everything which humans touch in a market economy,
where objects and services which lack a market price are thus treated
as free goods &#8212; means either that ultimately everything must be priced
or else that other means must be found by which to identify value. The
subfield of environmental economics is based on just this view &#8212; that
everything must be priced. To be sure, we cannot live without the
natural environment, yet treatment of natural goods and services as
free under the neoclassical economics
framework leads inevitably to their total consumption and destruction.</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">84</span> The
looming exhaustion of natural resources compels us to recognize that
market prices have limited worth in signaling true value, whether those
resources be the biota of the world upon which human beings also depend
for their existence or mineral wealth in the form of fossil fuel energy
which drives modern economies. If we do try in any way to price the
goods and services provided by the environment, they are so far beyond
counting that it becomes self-evident that our economic approach must
change.</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">85 ...
</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The
heart of ecological economics is ecological carrying capacity and
the premise of economic sustainability. Although this term has to some
extent become a mantra and widely abused, its most popular definition
remains that first enunciated by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> "development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">92</span>
Principle 3 of the 1992 UNCED Rio Declaration: </small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">"The right to development must be
fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">93</span> At
various times scholars have sought to improve upon this definition; one
offered by adherents of the ecological economics school reads as
follows:</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. For renewable resources
(fish,
trees, etc.), the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of
regeneration.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2. The rate at which we allow
economic
activity to generate wastes that must be passed into the environment
should not be allowed to exceed the environment&#8217;s ability to absorb
them.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>3. The depletion of nonrenewable
resources (oil, coal, etc.) should not be offset by investment in and
development of renewable substitutes for them.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">94 ...</span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological
Economics: Moral Premises<br>
If Georgist economics takes a moral stance primarily focused on
justice, ecological economics makes a much wider sweep. From its
standpoint the very survival of the world is at stake, so that matters
of distributive justice, so central to Georgists, tend to get lost in
debate.</span> Many ecological economists and environmental economists
would
claim that theirs is not a moral stance at all; rather it is a simple
empirical reality. One philosopher writing in the journal Environmental
Ethics sets forth a view reflective of many:
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>I do wish to point out that this
&#8216;holistic&#8217; view of the Earth&#8217;s ecological systems [i.e., the natural
world as an organism] does not itself constitute a moral norm. It is a
factual aspect of biological reality, to be understood as a set of
causal connections in ordinary empirical terms.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">98...</span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS OF SYNTHESIS OF GEORGIST AND
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS</span><br>
</small>The commonalities of Georgist economics and ecological
economics appear
to be organizable into six general points: 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) preservation of the commons, <br>
2) sustainable development, <br>
3) appropriate valuation of natural capital, <br>
4) ensuring social and biological community, <br>
5) fostering individual self-realization, and <br>
6) securing economic justice. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all these points is
the view that market activity needs to
be circumscribed and juxtaposed to the non-human, biological realm. It
appears that there is lots to be gained by some synthesis of the two
fields of discourse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ecological economists worry about the encroachment, and even the
elimination, of those elements of nature to which private property
title has not been granted. In their concern about the need to protect
the &#8220;commons,&#8221; they are torn between the view that only through
privatization can all the world&#8217;s assets be preserved and the
alternative view that any private appropriation of the commons
constitutes a moral compromise. They fear a repeat of Garrett Hardin&#8217;s
&#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221; Their argument often proposed is rather
complex to explicate: it assumes that private property titles may
perhaps provide the best incentive not to exploit the fruits of the
earth and the earth itself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">126</span></small> To
Georgists, on the other hand, the earth and all its resources are
already in fact the birthright of all humanity; individuals are
entitled to its use in return for the payment of rents. Further
privatization is anathema. The key rather is in distinguishing the
various components of ownership and getting prices right &#8212; mainly in
the
collection of economic rents.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Herman Daly appears by one of his most recent papers<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">134</span></small> to
be ever more closely drawn to the Georgist position that the &#8220;from
the point of view of equity it matters a great deal who receives the
prize for nature&#8217;s increasingly scarce services. Such payment is the
ideal source of funds with which to fight poverty and finance public
goods.&#8221;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Professor Daly goes on to say that</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Value added belongs to whoever
added
it. But the original value of that to which further value is added by
labor and capital should belong to everyone. Scarcity rents to natural
services, nature's value added, should be the focus of redistributive
efforts. Rent is by definition a payment in excess of necessary supply
price, and from the point of market efficiency is the least distorting
source of public revenue.&nbsp;<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Appeals to the generosity of
those who
have added much value by their labor and capital are more legitimate as
private charity than as a foundation for fairness in public policy.
Taxation of value added by labor and capital is certainly legitimate.
But it is both more legitimate and less necessary after we have, as
much as possible, captured natural resource rents for public revenue. <br>
<br>
The above reasoning reflects the basic insight of Henry George,
extending it from land to natural resources in general. Neoclassical
economists have greatly obfuscated this simple insight by their refusal
to recognize the productive contribution of nature in providing "that
to which value is added". In their defense it could be argued that this
was so because in the past economists considered nature to be
non-scarce, but now they are beginning to reckon the scarcity of nature
and enclose it in the market. Let us be glad of this, and encourage it
further.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>I am not advocating
revolutionary
expropriation of all private property in land and resources. If we
could start from a blank slate I would be tempted to keep land and
minerals as public property. But for many environmental goods,
previously free but increasingly scarce, we still do have a blank slate
as far as ownership is concerned. We must bring increasingly scarce yet
unowned environmental services under the discipline of the price
system, because these are truly rival goods the use of which by one
person imposes opportunity costs on others[2]. But for efficiency it
matters only that a price be charged for the resource, not who gets the
price. The necessary price or scarcity rent that we collect on newly
scarce environmental public goods (e.g. atmospheric absorption
capacity, the electromagnetic spectrum) should be used to alleviate
poverty and finance the provision of other public goods.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The modern form of the Georgist
insight
is to tax the resources and services of nature (those scarce things
left out of both the production function and GDP accounts) -- and to
use these funds for fighting poverty and for financing public goods. Or
we could simply disburse to the general public the earnings from a
trust fund created by these rents, as in the Alaska Permanent Fund,
which is perhaps the best existing institutionalization of the Georgist
principle. Taking away by taxation the value added by individuals from
applying their own labor and capital creates resentment. Taxing away
value that no one added, scarcity rents on nature's contribution, does
not create resentment. In fact, failing to tax away the scarcity rents
to nature and letting them accrue as unearned income to favored
individuals has long been a primary source of resentment and social
conflict.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The justice in the Georgist
tradition grows out of the premise that one
is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
exploring commonalities.... <a
