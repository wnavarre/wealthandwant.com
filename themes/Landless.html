      labor and he knew the indentures of his servitude. He endured conditions

    laborer is given what is called the freeman's certificate, a vote, but he
    is nevertheless
        a slave under a system of private ownership of the rent of land. He has

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The story goes on to
describe how the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided.&nbsp; </span>... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The organisation of man is such,
his
relations to the world in which he is placed are such &#8211; that is to say,
the immutable laws of God are such that it is beyond the power of human
ingenuity to devise any way by which the evils born of the injustice
that robs men of their birthright can be removed otherwise than by
opening to all the bounty that God has provided for all! </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since man can live only on land
and from land since land is
the reservoir of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is
taken, and on which he must draw for all that he can produce &#8211; does it
not irresistibly follow that to give the land in ownership to some men
and to deny to others all right to it is to divide mankind into the
rich and the poor, the privileged and the helpless?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does it not follow that those
who have no rights to the use of
land can live only by selling their labor to those who own the land? </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does it not follow that what the
Socialists call &#8220;the iron law
of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to
a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless mass of mere laborers &#8211; who of
themselves have no power to use their labor &#8211; the benefits of any
advance or improvement that does not alter this unjust division of land?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having
no Power to employ themselves, they must, either as labor-sellers or
land-renters, compete with one another for permission
to labor; <span style="font-weight: bold;">and this competition with
one another of men shut out from
God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse, must ultimately force wages to their
lowest point, the point at which life can just be maintained. ... </span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land being necessary to life and
labor, where private
property in land has divided society into a landowning class and a
landless class, there is no possible invention or improvement, whether

affect the ownership of land can prevent poverty or relieve the general
conditions of mere laborers.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>For, whether the effect of any
invention or improvement be

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical,
  of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
  of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
  if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
  a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in land
  shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With this interpretation,
  I find that the reasons you urge for private property in land are eight. Let
  us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN, paragraph
      5) ...<br>
      2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
      (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
      3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN, paragraph
      8.) ...<br>
      4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
      paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
      5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of mankind,
      and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned by Divine
      Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
      6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
      in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
      7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
      and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
      8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
      from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
      value
      of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private owner.
      (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>      <strong>3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use
      of land.</strong> (8.)</p>
  <p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
      to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
      of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
      you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others.
      You say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the
      earth does
      not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess
      the soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the
      land.</p>
  <p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
      of conscience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
          our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular, leaving
          the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I being the
          eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing so I have
          not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let them work
          for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would have had
          to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not be clear?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal sin,
      and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to make restitution
      and to do penance?</p>
  <p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
      land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
      supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a number
      of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly and prosper,
      you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership in the river,
      refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought it of them; and
      that thus they had become rich without work, while the others, though working
      hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly able to exist?</p>
  <p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
  <p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
      action:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby
        to minister to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does
        not
      drink
        of the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the
      river contribute
          their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all water
      is supplied either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry
      which is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for
      the
          water.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
      yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
  <p>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly depriving
      a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless he
      will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves his victim
      to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. But I would like to point out
      how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among private owners,
      ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks the
      largest facts.</p>
  <p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
      where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
      are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
      was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
      centuries has condemned it to desertion? History tells us. It was private property
      in land; the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw that ancient Italy
      was perishing; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop of men, let
      in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of Odin and Thor,
      and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the East shivered
      the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars of Mohammedan
      hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church of St. Sophia trampled
      the cross to rear the crescent!</p>
  <p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
      tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
      sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
      are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
      you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
      they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>

  <p>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
      and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the growth
      of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the artificial
      scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem as if there
      is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</p>
  <p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
      private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
      the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
      the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you
    may see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet,
    that
      prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the midst
      of the earth.</p>
  <p>To the mere materialist this is sin and shame. Shall we to whom this world
      is God&#8217;s world &#8212; we who hold that man is called to this life only
      as a prelude to a higher life &#8212; shall we defend it?<small>...&nbsp;<a

  <p><strong><em>e. Effect of Retaining Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>If society retained Rent for common purposes, all incentive to hold land
    for any other object than immediate use would disappear. The effect may be
    illustrated by a comparison of the last preceding chart with the following:
    [chart]</p>
  <p> There is but one difference between this chart and the chart immediately
    preceding. In that Rent is confiscated to private use, whereas in this Rent
    is retained for common use. All the labor force indicated with red in the
    first of the two charts would not more than utilize the space to the left
    and part of the adjoining one, which would elevate Wages to what, with the
    given labor force, could be produced from the poorer of the two spaces. After
    that, increase of Rent would not enrich land-owners at the expense of other
    classes; it would enrich the whole community.108</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">108. The laborer would receive in Distribution all that
        he earned and no more than he earned in Production; and that is the natural
        law.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In social conditions, where industry is subdivided and trade is intricate,
    it is impossible to say arbitrarily what is the equivalent of given labor.
    Hence no statute fixing the compensation for labor can really be operative.
    All that we can say is that labor is worth what men freely contract to give
    and take for it. But it must be what they freely contract to take as well
    as what they freely contract to give; and men are not free to contract for
    the sale of their labor when labor generally is so divorced from land as
    to abnormally glut the labor market and make men's sale of their labor for
    almost anything the buyer offers, the alternative of starvation. Laborers
    may be as truly enslaved by divorcing labor from land as by driving them
    with a whip.</p>

chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which

to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring

  compensate the landless for tenure &#8211; the right to exclude others
&#8211; that society grants to the landed in preference to the
  landless. Common carriers, with rates regulated to reasonable levels,
  would seem to be a form of open access. In practise, the last point

  being taxed and then allowed to shift the taxes forward to customers. ... </small></p>

</small><br>
<small>The land is a commodity that strictly belongs to this class. It
is
limited in extent, and no human power can enlarge or extend its area.
The competition for it is excessive, the competitors struggling for
its attainment -- not for the purpose of satisfying a taste for the
fine arts, or to gratify a passion for the rare or beautiful, but to
secure a necessary means of existence: for they must live on and by
the land, or they cannot live at all. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The owner, therefore, of that
land can put on it any rent he pleases, and the poor people competing
for it have no choice but to accept his terms or die in a ditch or a
poorhouse. Under the present system of Land Tenure, the owners are
not only enabled, but actually exact for the use of the land the last
shilling the tenant is able to pay, leaving him only what is barely
sufficient to keep him from dying.<br>
<br>
</span></small><small>Mr. Mill, who is the highest of all authorities
on this subject,
thus writes on the letting of land as it is actually carried out in
Ireland: "With individual exceptions (some of them very honourable
ones) the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain
it of its produce. What has been epigrammatically said in the
discussions on 'peculiar burdens' is literally true when applied to
them, that the greatest 'burden' on the land is the landlords.
Returning nothing to the soil, they consume its whole produce, minus
the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of
famine."&nbsp;

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In How the Other Half Dies,
Susan George wrote that <span style="font-weight: bold;">"The most
pressing cause of the abject poverty which millions of people in this
world endure is that a mere 2.5% of landowners with more than 100
hectares control nearly three quarters of all the land in the world -
with the top 0.23% controlling half."</span> To recognize this social
plague for what it is, and to avert a backlash of despair, requires a
clear understanding of two great themes: the Promised Land and the
Wasteland. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The point of departure of liberation theology is the recognition
of the
awful fact that millions lead subhuman lives. The rural landless seek
refuge in cities, often becoming squatters in barrios or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">favelas </span>with open sewage and no
safe water supply. They may earn fifteen dollars a month if they find
work at all. Children live in the streets and go to bed hungry. Illness
and drought, and even complaining of their lot, may lead to premature
death. And they can see the Mercedes behind the iron gates of walled
mansions. (Ironically, <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">mercedes </span>is
also a Spanish legal term denoting title to a large grant of land.)
Like poor Lazarus in the parable of Jesus (Luke 16:19-31), they survive
on the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. When judgement comes
to the rich man, he receives no mercy because he had shown none.

to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1894)
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today, as the last census
reports show, the majority of American
farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first
form of tenancy; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">the great
majority of our people are landless
men, without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the
land they still foolishly speak of as their country. </span>This is
the
reason why the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by
pauperism has already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in
more dangerous type the proletarian of ancient Rome.&nbsp; <a

Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the state granted land
titles to a fraction of the
population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
or "free lunch" from the actual land users. ... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The focus of Henry George&#8217;s
inquiry, and of his disciples, is the
pursuit of justice. Economic justice is an agenda which ecological
economists also subscribe to, even though their immediate focus is
concern about the earth&#8217;s survival at all, let alone the distribution
of its fruits. Here, however, is where the Georgist tradition is able
to contribute most to the environmental justice program. There is a
broad appreciation, particularly among ecological economists that have
worked in poorer nations, that natural resources are endangered every
bit as much by the scarcity of basic necessities as by overpopulation.
Urban elites usurp high value lands and retain land rents growing out
of their production; <span style="font-weight: bold;">poor people are
marginalized and left to fend for
themselves. They often survive by taking what little environmental
resources are left on ravaged land sites, further reducing the
resiliency of these local ecologies. </span>Collection and
redistribution of
land rents, either in the form of public services or in the form of a
citizens&#8217; dividends, offers a way to restore equity without
redistribution of land titles and without all the dislocations this
might entail. Many third world leaders at the present time see
solutions to poverty and economic inequality in the redistribution of
land titles. Georgists argue that this is not necessary; all that is
necessary is to recover the land rent and assure its equitable
distribution to rightful claimants. ... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_18F.html">18 Fallacies</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. "If property
falls, America falls"</b>
</small><br>
<small>Wrong, at least in my opinion. Property is not an end in itself;
it is a means of getting resources put to their best use for the
general good. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To secure that end, property
rights are instituted among men,
deriving their just standing from the consent of the unpropertied.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whenever any form of property
becomes destructive of that end, it
is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to
institute new principles most likely to effect their safety and
happiness. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consent of the unpropertied?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That means property must work for
the benefit of all, not just
those who own property. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But abolish property!? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is a red flag indeed, but
note I said alter or abolish, and
it is our own Declaration of Independence I am paraphrasing. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like Jefferson, I generally prefer
alter to abolish: 'abolishing'
something is nihilistic until we know what we want to replace it
with. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The point is, we have many
degrees of freedom as citizens; we are
not bound body and soul by decisions made, or allegedly made, in the
past.&nbsp; ... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_18F.html"><span
