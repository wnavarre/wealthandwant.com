<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, born in Philadelphia in 1839 (when Philadelphia's population
      of about 94,000 made in America's 4th largest city (behind Manhattan,
      Baltimore and New Orleans, but larger than Booston, Cincinnati and Brooklyn),
      wrote about the relationship between increasing urban land values and poverty.
      By 1870, he was in San Francisco, by thealready America's 10th largest
    city with a population of almost 150,000, and making comparisons to Manhattan,
    whose
      population was approaching 950,000. In the 1880s and again in the 1890s
    he ran for mayor of New York City: in the earlier election, he came in second,
    ahead of a young Theodore Roosevelt; he died a few days before the election
    of 1897. (By 1900, after the five boroughs of New York were formed into a
    single city, NYC's population was over 3.4 million.)</p>
  <p>George had a great appreciation for cities as the nexus in which civilization
    could be advanced, and he was troubled by the extent to which America's cities
    were also the place where one found extreme poverty. He sought the connection
    between cities and poverty, and worked out the relationship in his first
    and most famous book, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty:</a></span><a href="../George_P&P.html"><font
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" size="+1"> </font><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An inquiry into the cause of
    industrial depressions and of increase of want with increase of wealth ...
    The Remedy</span></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">.&nbsp; </span>He 
dedicated the book &quot;to those who, seeing the
    vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege,
    feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.&quot;</p>
  <p>With this in mind, it is somewhat odd that many academic economists, whose
    exposure to George's ideas was minimal, if queried about George, will tend
    to come up with the suggestion that his ideas might have been fine for 18th
    century
    America
    when
    most people
    lived on farms. But, as my mother was fond of saying in other contexts, their
    education has been neglected: George's ideas are specificly urban in their
    focus, and they are more relevant today than ever.</p>
  <p>If the solutions commonly proposed to the most serious problems of our cities
    don't seem to you to have a high likelihood of solving those problems, perhaps
    it is time, as Clarence Darrow put it, </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The &#8220;single tax&#8221; is so simple, so fundamental, and
      so easy to carry into effect that I have no doubt that it will be about
      the
        last reform the world will ever get. People in this world are not often
      logical.&#8221;</p>

    Henry George: <a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">What
    the Railroad Will Bring Us</a> [Californians, and particularly San
    Franciscans]&nbsp; (1868)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The truth is, that the
completion of the railroad and the consequent great increase of
business and population, will not be a benefit to all of us, but only
to a portion. As a general rule (liable of course to exceptions) those
who have it will make wealthier; for those who have not, it will make
it more difficult to get. Those who have lands, mines, established
businesses, special abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for
it and find increased opportunities; those who have only their own
labor will be come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first,
because it will take more capital to buy land or to get into business;
and second, because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this
capital will be harder for them to obtain.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What, for instance, does the rise in land mean? Several things,
but certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future
for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of
the State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a
dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In
other words, the settler who last year might have had at once a farm of
his own, must now either go to work on wages for some one else, pay
rent or buy on time; in either case being compelled to give to the
capitalist a large proportion of the earnings which, had he arrived a
year ago, he might have had all for of himself. And as proprietorship
is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable to the poor, more
are forced into the labor market to compete with each other, and cut
down the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division of their joint
production between labor and capital more in favor of capital and less
in favor of labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And so in San Francisco the rise in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for rent;
means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies courts,
slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small><br>
<br>
<small>San Francisco has one great advantage -- there is probably a
larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
lots than in any other city of the United States. The product of the
rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the great
social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship cannot
be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the princely
domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the pueblo was
not appropriated to furnishing free, or almost free, homesteads to
actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into the hands of a
few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been taken up in time
and in a proper spirit, this disposition might easily have been
secured, and the great city of the future would have had a population
bound to her by the strongest ties -- a population better, freer, more
virtuous, independent and public spirited than any great city the world
has ever had.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To say that "Power is constantly stealing from the many to the
few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends to
concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the new
era into which California is entering, its operations will be more
marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great centralizer. It
kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the same way kills
little businesses and builds up great ones. We have had comparatively
but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning "very rich" has in
these times. But the process is going on. The great city that is to be
will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts and Spragues, and he who
looks a few years ahead may even now read their names as he passes
along Montgomery, California or Front streets.&nbsp; With the
protection which property gets in modern times -- with stocks, bonds,
burglar-proof safes and policemen; with the railroad and the telegraph,
after a man gets a certain amount of money it is plain sailing, and he
need take no risks. Astor said that to get his first thousand dollars
was his toughest struggle; but when one gets a million, if he has
ordinary prudence, how much he will have is only a question of life.
Nor can we rely on the absence of laws of primogeniture and entail to
dissipate these large fortunes so menacing to the general weal. Any
large fortune will, of course, become dissipated in time, even in spite
of laws of primogeniture and entail; but every aggregation of wealth
implies and necessitates others, and so that the aggregations remain,
it matters little in what particular hands. Stewart, in the natural
course of things, will die before long, and being childless, his wealth
will be dissipated, or at least go out of the dry goods business. But
will this avail the smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing
out? Not at all. Some one else will step in, take his place in the
trade, and run the great money-making machine which he has organized,
or some other similar one. Stewart and other great houses have
concentrated the business, and it will remain concentrated.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes to the effects of this
concentration of wealth. One millionaire involves the little existence
of just so many proletarians. It is the great tree and the saplings
over again. We need not look far from the palace to find the hovel.
When people can charter special steamboats to take them to watering
places, pay four thousand dollars for the summer rental of a cottage,
build marble stables for their horses, and give dinner parties which
cost by the thousand dollars a head, we may know that there are poor
girls on the streets pondering between starvation and dishonor.&nbsp;
When liveries appear, look out for bare-footed children. A few liveries
are now to be seen on our streets; we think their appearance coincides
in date with the establishment of the almshouse. They are few, plain
and modest now; they will grow more numerous and gaudy -- and then we
will not wait long for the children -- their corollaries. ...<a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
Poverty! Can there be any doubt of its cause? Go, into the old
countries &#8212; go into western Ireland, into the highlands of Scotland &#8212;
these are purely primitive communities. There you will find people as
poor as poor can be &#8212; living year after year on oatmeal or on potatoes,
and often going hungry. I could tell you many a pathetic story.
Speaking to a Scottish physician who was telling me how this diet was
inducing among these people a disease similar to that which from the
same cause is ravaging Italy (the Pellagra), I said to him: "There is
plenty of fish; why don't they catch fish? There is plenty of game; I
know the laws are against it, but cannot they take it on the sly?"
"That," he said, "never enters their heads. Why, if a man was even
suspected of having a taste for trout or grouse he would have to leave
at once."</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is no difficulty in discovering what makes those people
poor. They have no right to anything that nature gives them. All they
can make above a living they must pay to the landlord. They not only
have to pay for the land that they use, but they have to pay for the
seaweed that comes ashore and for the turf they dig from the bogs. They
dare not improve, for any improvements they make are made an excuse for
putting up the rent. These people who work hard live in hovels, and the
landlords, who do not work at all &#8212; oh! they live in luxury in London
or Paris. If they have hunting boxes there, why they are magnificent
castles as compared with the hovels in which the men live who do the
work. Is there any question as to the cause of poverty there?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a
lower depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the
evils of land monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not
take you to Skye or Kintire &#8212; I would take you to Dublin or Glasgow or
London. There is something worse than physical deprivation, something
worse than starvation; and that is the degradation of the mind, the
death of the soul. That is what you will find in those cities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, what is the cause of that? Why, it is plainly to be seen;
the people driven off the land in the country are driven into the slums
of the cities. For every man that is driven off the land the demand for
the produce of the workmen of the cities is lessened; and the man
himself with his wife and children, is forced among those workmen to
compete upon any terms for a bare living and force wages down. Get work
he must or starve&#8212;get work he must or do that which those people, so
long as they maintain their manly feelings, dread more than death, go
to the alms-houses. That is the reason, here as in Great Britain, that
the cities are overcrowded. Open the land that is locked up, that is
held by dogs in the manger, who will not use it themselves and will not
allow anybody else to use it, and you would see no more of tramps and
hear no more of over-production.&nbsp; ...<a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html"> <span

<p>Clarence Darrow: <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">How to Abolish
    Unfair Taxation</a> (1913)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fundamentally, all law recognizes the right to eminent domain, to take the
      portion of any human being for the welfare of the public &#8212; that no
      man's claim to any portion of the earth shall stand in the way of the common
      good.
      This is a common law, but in practice it only applies where a rich railroad
      wants to get the land of some poor widow.</p>
  <p>Everybody who works is poor; nobody would work if they were not poor, and
      nobody can get rich working. I never tried it, but I have seen others try
    it. The land boomer comes along and gets good car service to this poor man's
    home,
      and then charges him ten dollars per month instead of five. A lot of reformers
      are trying to get parks laid out in the slums, which only make the poor
    move, for they cannot pay the increased rent. The greater the population,
    the less
      the worker gets. As the land becomes valuable, more and more goes to rent.
      The bigger the city, the deeper the poverty; the bigger the city the more
    degradation, there are the almshouses and gaols filled to overflowing. It
    is better for
      the men who own the earth to have big cities &#8212; but for no one else.
      Every man, woman, and child adds to the wealth of the land owner; the others
      must
      secure land upon which to live, and they must bid with each other for the
      right to live. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

the opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting
revenue should be shared equally. There are important applications of
this principle to questions of environmental protection, relieving

</span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

after a good fire"; arsonists take that quite literally.</span>&nbsp;
In
Beverly Hills, California, "tear-downs" are routine as
taste-obsolescence races through fashionable neighborhoods where the
land outvalues even the elegant buildings.&nbsp; These are dated after
thirty years.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The opportunity cost of capital is fleeting.&nbsp; Capital loses
most
of
it the moment it is committed to a specific form, whose physical
alternative use is often only as scrap.&nbsp; Land's "opportunity
cost" is real and viable at all times.&nbsp; The scrap value of
capital is often zero or negative (radioactive waste supplying an
extreme
example).</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land may be afflicted with such "negative capital," the harmful
waste from prior usage.&nbsp; An example is the spent carcass of an old
building needing costly demolition.&nbsp; Some would class that spent
carcass as a
subtraction from the site value, but "negative capital" makes
more sense, as may be inferred by considering the relations between a
landlord and a tenant in a perfect market.&nbsp; The lease holds the
tenant liable for damages he does and wastes he leaves; the prudent
landlord requires of the tenant a deposit, or in larger cases a bond,
to
assure performance.&nbsp; Both acknowledge that damage done by use is
imputed to the user, not to the land. <a

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices
with practical resolutions and synergies</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
great deal of latent rent would
be generated by new, full
development. It is not just the individual sites that matter here,
but the synergistic community effects of active renewal and full,
timely development. </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The positive neighborhood effects of replacing
old buildings with new are irresistible and contagious, raising land
prices all around. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The converse is also true: the negative
neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand without replacement
are depressive. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and
put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick off a general
process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope into optimism:
optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax base.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>New development likes to anchor
onto healthy neighborhoods. Richard
Hurd, father of urban studies in America, taught us in 1902
that land values are marked by <b>continuity in space</b>. It's
still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles endure.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep and
stifle renewal. Whatever slows renewal of one site therefore slows
the neighborhood, which reflects back blight to the first, a vicious
downward spiral. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conversely, new buildings help
stimulate renewal around
them.<font size="-2"><small><i>12</i></small></font> The rule is that
new
buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other Defenders so other
owners have to renew, too. When they do, where better than next to
the newest, hottest building? So renewal is cumulative, just like
blight, only upwards in a benign spiral. A benign spiral is a "free
lunch," the kind that cynics say "there ain't no such thing as." </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a city untaxes buildings its
land prices, the new tax base,
are pushed up. Competition for sites raises the tax base -- not
buildings, now, but land prices derived from ground rents. Using the
higher base the city can improve public services, if needed, but
without taxing any building, without scaring away any generators of
fiscal surpluses. In this scenario, buildings raise the tax base
indirectly, by raising the value of land around them. So do
productive people, when their wages are not taxed away. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices are raised just by the
expectation of new buildings'
being tax free. The mere expectation will <i>immediately</i> boost
the value of land, even before the new buildings go up.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax policy helps renew
cities, without subsidizing or
administering teardowns and "clearance" of old buildings and
neighborhoods. Georgist policy does not speed renewal by penalizing
old buildings, but by encouraging new ones. It does not subsidize
new ones, it just stops penalizing them. Teardown is never an end in
itself; it only comes when incidental to releasing land for new
buildings of greater capacity. This matter is covered in "How to
renew a dying city," bound herein.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist
policy lets a region, nation, or the world add population
and/or capital without diluting its resource base.</span> It is as
though
rescuers pulled drowning people into a lifeboat, and their presence
made the boat expand instead of sink! Call it <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"The Accommodating
Lifeboat Theorem."</span> It sounds like the Miracle of the Loaves and
Fishes, but it is a different kind of miracle: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">synergy</span>. It comes
from the power of enlarging the market, as described by George in his
chapter on the effects of increased population, and Adam Smith in his
aphorism, "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the
market." An indication of it is that bigger cities around the world
have more land value per head than small ones, as documented by
William Alonso. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We must temper this claim. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>Bigger
cities are often located on
better land, so size isn't all that accounts for Alonso's finding.
However, more than sheer size, and more than good natural location,
is the internal circulation of a city. Georgist policies are
essential to financing good circulation, containing sprawl, and
inducing private land development complementary to the circulatory
system.</small></span><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_HTRaDC.html">How to
Revive a Dying City</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Blight is not restricted to
stagnant or declining cities. In
booming Los Angeles, there is Watts. In nearby Riverside, one of the
fastest growing cities in the nation, the CBD [Central Business
District] is surrounded by blight
which, among other things, frustrates years of subsidies aimed at
reviving the moribund CBD itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These extreme cases are not
anomalies, not simply ghettoes and
embarrassments; <span style="font-weight: bold;">they are symptoms of
systemic malfunction</span>. They could
be portents and symbols for the rest of the economy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Blight may be
defined as failure to maintain, replace, and renew capital inherited
from the past. </span>Studies indicate that all of American industry
faces
this problem, compared with vigorous foreign competitors. In learning
to cure blight, we may learn to restore the greatness and pride of
this whole troubled nation. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There
is also good news: some cities have risen from the grave.
Indeed, all land development is resurrection in a sense: all land has
been used before for something.</span> The history of a city lot
usually
shows that there were several antecedent improvements, layered like
the ruins of ancient Troy. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The goal
should be to make renewal happen
faster and more widely, while we are still here to benefit. ...</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some cities
should be abandoned.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Towns around played-out mines are
obvious examples. A farm town
becomes redundant when new roads let customers patronize a larger or
better town. Salvage what you can and move on. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Some would apply the
same logic to all cities. </span>Dead cities aren't
lost, they say, but rebuilt elsewhere; they were cash cows that have
been milked dry. Their depreciation allowances are reinvested on new
frontiers; people and vitality move with the capital. It is an
important half-truth, but a half-truth is also half wrong. The basic
original site stays put; land cannot move. Public and private social
capital cannot move, either. </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We cannot afford throwaway cities
in a finite world. New natural
sites are not common. There is only one Hudson Valley with only one
mouth, and here New York City has stood for 350 years. </span>We
cannot
abandon the Bronx and duplicate its environment somewhere; we cannot
rebuild the natural setting, and the sunk social capital is too
costly. Relocating to suburbs involves commuting cost in terms of
money and congestion. And then, when we tire of the new suburbs,
where will we go next?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, blighted areas have
high potential market values.
Picture a topographic map of a city where the contour lines represent
points not of equal elevation, but of equal market value per square
foot. The peaks, the Everests and McKinleys, are in the city retail
centers, where just one square foot rises to $2,000 (about $90
million per acre). Land just a few miles away from dizzying altitudes
can hardly be worthless. Harlem is near Park Avenue; Watts is near
Beverly Hills; South State Street is very near the Sears Tower.
Newark is 15 minutes by train from Manhattan. Newark office rents are
$25/sf per year. That is less, of course, than in Manhattan, but in
Riverside, California, we are throwing up offices to get rent of
$12/sf per year, while Newark stagnates.</small><br>

<small>George saw cities as <i>foci</i> of civilization's basic
mechanisms. People with mutual access, associating on equal terms,
expedite cooperation and specialization through the market.
Multivariate interactions are synergistic. Indeed, while each parcel
is developed in the stage of decreasing returns, the composite city
is generally in a stage of increasing returns, thanks to synergy: the
whole exceeds the sum of its parts, and increases to the whole yield
more than the sum of increases to the parts. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Synergistic surplus</span>,
said George, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">lodges
in urban land rents.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus he
explained a
phenomenon which other economists overlooked: the unparalleled rise
in urban rents and land prices, and in owners' wealth and power. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To understand
ground rents and land prices is to
understand cities; not to understand is to remain mired forever in
confusion and fallacy. Ground rent continues forever, generally
tending to rise; therefore, to buy title to land, people pay prices
that look high relative to current cash flows. </span>....<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Urban land
prices take your breath away.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
prices vary extremely from city to city or block to block.
The cost to build a square foot of floor space is fairly constant
from place to place, but demand varies with location.</span> A small
rise in
floor rental translates into a large rise in ground rent and land
price, because the land owner gets everything above what is required
to operate and amortize the building. Thus, 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>in Riverside,
neighborhood mall space rental of $12 just pays for the building,
with only a little left over, resulting in land prices of perhaps
$5-$8/sf. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In Manhattan, rentals are triple those in Riverside; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">all
surplus accrues to ground rent,</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">resulting in land
prices 300 times
higher than in Riverside.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At key locations in bigger
cities, land prices are not just high
per square foot, they are higher per capita than in small cities.
They are even higher relative to building values, in spite of the
high-rise buildings. Remember that each additional floor adds more
ground rent, because floor space rental is more than enough to cover
the added cost. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices across cities and
neighborhoods are much more
differentiated than other measures economists commonly cite. For
example, the median income in upper east side Manhattan is about 8
times higher than north of Central Park, while the price of land per
square foot is probably 40 times higher. Urban land is also highly
concentrated in ownership; a handful of people and corporations own
most of it. A growing share of income property is held by wealthy
aliens, who want to diversify and acquire secure wealth they can
manage by remote control. Aliens even hold a good deal of residential
property in international "jet set" communities.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because
urban rents are a social surplus, not a payment for
anyone's making or supplying land, parties other than the landowner
have a claim. A good deal of American politics deals with how to
assert that claim and share in the surplus.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Dividing a big pie seems a pleasant enough task, but Confucius
knew better: "It is easier to face a common enemy than to share a
surplus." The common ways of sharing surplus are clumsy, divisive,
and destructive; they bear some responsibility for dead cities. With
too much quarreling over spoils, there are no spoils to dispute.
Consider how spoils are shared, and how we might do better.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rent control</small></li>
  <li><small>"French Equity"
(Equity in Kind):&nbsp; Today we approach French Equity indirectly, and
expensively. We
distribute land haphazardly, but seek to make every parcel equally
good by extending utilities and roads to all parcels on the same
terms, regardless of cost or location. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Economists call such schemes
"postage stamp pricing," because
postal rates do not vary with delivery costs. Manhattan has 64,000
residents per square mile; Montana has 5.4. It costs a lot more to
collect or deliver mail in Montana. The reason postal rates rise is
that the U.S. urban population is spreading out more like Montana and
less like Manhattan (which once had over 100,000 per square mile).
Here are five other examples: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small>The British Columbia Ferry Service. ...
    </small></li>
  <li><small>British Columbia Hydro.... </small></li>
  <li><small>Water and sewer service in Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin. ... </small></li>
  <li><small>State university campuses. ...</small></li>
  <li><small>Water supply in California. ...
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The key to renewing cities is
shifting from obstructive ways of
sharing rent, like rent control; and destructive ways, like looting
and subsidies; to constructive ways. Henry George showed us how
equity and efficiency go hand in hand, how the magic of justice
combines with the magic of incentive.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, by George, equity need not be in kind. The monetary
mechanism overcomes the clumsiness of in-kind equity. If four
families inherit a one-family house, all four don't crowd in; they
sell and divide the money, or one buys out the others. There is
equity in money as well as in real estate. Money is often better; the
reinvestment opportunity puts the house on a magic carpet to follow
you anywhere. Money is wonderful!</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, by George, use the tax mechanism. Do not divide
land into
unusable morsels, or shackle the market with rent controls, or
dissipate rent in subsidies. Give land to the highest bidder, and tax
ground rents to support government. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Higher
Taxes that Promote Development." The fixed tax is levied on land
value, based on opportunity cost. The owner uses land harder and
improves it more to meet a fixed tax; or sells, releasing surplus
land to those needing more space. Taxes stifle enterprise only if
they increase with enterprise. Land tax increases only with
opportunity cost, which is independent of the enterprise of the
owner. The only activity this tax impairs is withholding land from
use.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's land tax promotes equity
toward the landless in at least
four ways: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it relieves them of taxes, to the extent that landowners
pay more; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>it supplies them with more goods and services, as land is
used better; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>it offers them jobs producing those goods and services;
and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>it offers them a better chance to acquire land, as
surpluses are
released to the market.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is supply-side economics
with a kick.&nbsp; ... George's program not only reconciles efficiency
and equity, it squares taxes and incentives. What more can we ask of
economic policy than to resolve stand-offs that have confused us, and
dead-locked constructive action, for generations? ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Camden has the highest tax rate in New Jersey, causing a vicious
circle as high rates drive away capital and further erode the tax
base. What if only land value were taxed? The depressant would become
a stimulant by the simple magic of converting a variable charge into
a fixed, unavoidable one. So it is with most depressed cities, which
today look vainly to Washington for salvation. They need enabling
legislation from their states, on the Pennsylvania model, but given
this power can save themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
counterpart of sharing rent through taxation is to untax
things, like buildings, that involve human endeavor.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This doubles the
incentive effect.</span> If land tax is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">stick</span>,
untaxing buildings is the
corresponding <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">carrot</span>,
and George's program makes both larger. Every
lot with an old "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Defender</span>"
building has a potential replacement, the
"<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Challenger</span>."
Taxing buildings rigs the fight against the Challenger.
Say the lot-cum-Defender is worth $100K, and the Challenger would
cost $500K to build. Challenger cash flow must exceed Defender cash
flow by enough to pay $500K, plus added taxes based on it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax, by contrast, is
impartial between Defender and
Challenger; the market decides. </small><br>
<br>
<small>New buildings face liquidity crises; almost all are built on
credit and need time to yield cash. The timing of tax on a building
maximizes the damage during the crisis period, for any given tax
yield over time. Of course, every building uses public services, but
new buildings in older cities pay for more than they receive, while
old ones receive more than they pay for. Think of building tax as a
forced loan to the Treasury, to be recovered when the building is
older. What could be more counterproductive than forcing a loan from
a builder passing through a credit crisis? The Georgist tax is low
when the builder's cash needs are pressing, and rises slowly over
time as the site ripens to its next best use.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep, and
stifle renewal.</span> Whatever slows renewal of one site slows the
neighborhood in a vicious, downward spiral. Conversely, new buildings
stimulate renewal. There are exceptions; some new buildings sterilize
blocks with blank walls.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the exception is not the
rule, and abuse is not the precept.
The rule is that new buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other
Defenders, so that other owners also renew. </span>When they do, where
better than next to the newest building? Renewal, like blight, is
cumulative, but in a benign, upward spiral. Competition for sites
raises the tax base if land values are derived from ground rents. The
higher base allows the city to improve public services without taxing
buildings or scaring away generators of fiscal surpluses. In this
scenario, buildings raise the tax base indirectly, by raising the
value of land around them.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Riverside built a downtown
pedestrian mall when they were in
vogue, and has been sorry ever since. It did not work; retailers
deserted, and half the stores are empty. I asked the developer of a
successful mall why he thought downtown failed, and got a two word
answer: "absentee ownership." I should have known, having preached it
for years. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Farm advisers say, "The best
dressing for soil is the owner's
shadow, applied daily." In town they ask, "Who's keeping the store?"
Absentees aren't the only negligent owners, nor are they all bad.
Torpid owners are the problem, and they come in many forms. A city
wants to be rid of owners who see real estate as a cash cow for their
retirement, and to replace them with owners who see it as a vehicle
for enterprise and who apply their shadows daily. The shadows follow
them to local civic clubs and to enterprising downtown or
neighborhood associations for making joint improvements. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The surplus to land attracts
outside buyers. Absentees, redundant
parties in production, are often top bidders for pure ownership,
which is the legal right to receive land rent plus unearned
increments that accrue over time. Georgist taxation cuts directly
into rents and unearned increments, which attract absentee owners; it
spares the rewards of enterprise. It thereby effects a market
transfer of ownership from absentees to occupants, with the community
benefits that follow. In a period of rising concern over alien
takeovers of U.S. real estate, these points merit focused
attention. </small><small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The question I am assigned is
whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The property tax, rather than
"shoot anything that
moves," is a charge on inactivity.</span></b> It taxes both lands and
buildings on their market value, regardless of how they are used.
"Hold on," you might say, "how about the very activity of
constructing those buildings?" Yes, touch&eacute;, the property tax
does shoot at that, and shoot hard. However, that is why we are here
today, to consider modifying the tax to exempt buildings.<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> The
proposal is to make it a tax mainly, or even purely, on "land ex
buildings," a tax on inactivity, a tax just for sitting on a piece
carved from the world's fixed, limited land supply.</span> <strong>... </strong></small>  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have here data (Gaffney, 1970, submitted herewith) I worked up
  in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
  correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be over
  twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it should
  have been 70%.&nbsp; </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>How does one come to so startling a finding? Wisconsin is not a
  backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
  administration. What I did was study sites on the eve of demolition.
  When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace with a new
  building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that the building
  has no residual value. All the value is then in the land. However, in
  Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the building was worth about
  three times as much as the land, just before tear-down. That is a good
  way to measure to what extent land is underassessed.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When the visitor first gapes at its
  skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you poke
  around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the exception.
  Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of it tumbledown,
  commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State Building. Old as it is, it is still
  nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is in a
  so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
  location (57th Street, I would guess). Even so, when the site and the
  building sold in separate transactions a few years ago, the site
  represented 1/3 of the total value. What does that say about the land
  fraction on neighboring parcels, covered only with the remains of
  ordinary old structures? What does that say about the land fraction
  nearer the 100% location?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;Besides that, exempting buildings from the property tax
  will raise the value of the land that goes with them. When you exempt
  buildings and uptax land, you are still taxing the same parcel of real
  estate, you are just taxing it in a different way. What you don't get
  from the building you can now get from the land, whose taxable capacity
  is enhanced by your exempting the building, and all potential future
  buildings, on the parcel. The process of arbitrage, the higgling of the
  land market, should make the land value rise by about the amount of the
  discounted present value of the building taxes abated.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;<b>"How about corporate stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt
  corporate wealth from the property tax?" Actually, almost all
  jurisdictions already exempt stock and all other "intangible" property. Not to
  worry, however, you tax corporate assets. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When you
  rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten on most tax
  rolls are all corporations. </span>None of their multi-national
  profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and
  creative transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your
  assessor's maps. This makes sense anyway. Why should you think you
  can tax a corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you
  is its property in your town. ...</b></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>In other cases, industries occupy land of high value that
  is wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it
  has not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias
  of assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to
  improved "lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of
  wholesale discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis,
Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
<a
 href="file:///C|/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#100%25%20location">100%
location</a>, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. To make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In still other cases "industry"
surrounds and intersperses itself
with vast swaths of vacant land. They hold it for open storage,
parking, purported "future expansion," accessways, buffers, backlots,
discouragement of competitors, etc. Many of Los Angeles' swankiest
buildings of today arose over the former surplus lands of the cinema
industry, which disgorged them before 1978 because they used to have
to pay substantial taxes on surplus lands. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive
feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
balance of payments. When you
get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
the value of its own base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
extensive. They occur on good or superior residential land originally
developed over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed
the upper crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they
"filtered down," and down, and down, until their occupants began
radiating negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point
where the neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one
wants to build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal
value of land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social
and public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to
renew itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the
Bronx, East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;I once wrote a long chapter
on this subject, "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">T</span><b><i>he
Adequacy of Land as a Tax Base</i></b>" (Gaffney, 1970). It came out
of two years of research, and is too long even to summarize now. I am
delivering it to Pat Salkin, however, and hope she may add it to the
record of this conference. I also attach a short bibliography of
articles that expand on topics covered above, for whoever is moved to
study more on this fascinating subject. I hope you think it as
important as I do. <b>Please pick up this ball and run with it.

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<small>... Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.

</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small> <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>

rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, for pricing to work at
all, there must be both supply and
demand; the lack of either results in there being no market price at
all. Is it possible, perhaps, that policies might be developed where
demand for certain resources are reduced to zero &#8212; and hence no price?
To some extent this is how the Georgist economics approach works. It
leaves certain realms of the commons unthreatened by exploitation for
the reason that the attention of the market is focused elsewhere. By
the collection of economic rent the prices of resources are effectively
shifted, so much so that the market arena is profoundly altered.
Resource prices are shifted in such a way that their use is curtailed
and their consumption concentrated. It was noted earlier, for example,
that collection of land rent tends to reverse the centrifugal forces of
sprawl, actualizing demand at the core of urban areas and leaving
remote regions uninhabited and
intact. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Economic rent accrues to
sites that have high demand and
frequent use; collecting that economic rent tends to concentrate their
use in ways that discourages speculative practices, allocate their use
to those who can best maximize their utility, and leave other sites and
commodities in remote areas less affected by human activity. </span>So

growth boundaries, community land trusts, and other devices which are
expensive to implement and have notable records of failure....<a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html"> <span

  Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">Who Says Cities are Poor? They Just Don't Know How to Tax
  Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
  <p>It's been an axiom of urban policy for the past half century to lament the
      plight of American cities &#8212; that they have lost their most productive
      populations, that their infrastructure is deteriorated and obsolete, that they
      contain people most in need, and that their tax base is limited. This essay
      argues that none of this needs to be so, and that municipal leaders need only
      to think &quot;outside the box&quot; as the hackneyed phrase goes, to find
      undreamed of revenue that will not only provide all the support cities
      need but enhance the economic vitality of their being by its collection.</p>
  <p>As conventionally viewed, cities not only have need for more services but
      lack the tax base on which to draw from. The services are greater in cities
      than in suburban and rural communities because that's where streets and other
      general services are the heaviest, where the schools are the greatest challenge,
      where the police and fire departments are most relied upon, where the social
      programs face the greatest pathologies, and where general administration is
      the most complex and requires the greatest control and coordination. It seems
      so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning, and no further discussion is required.</p>
  <p>At the same time, so the argument goes, the revenue bases upon which to
    levy taxes are most lacking: the middle class and the wealthier populations
    have
      largely moved out, and stores have relocated to malls and highway junctions
      taking the sales tax base with them. What's left are deteriorating buildings
      and a complaining citizenry: the footloose commercial and industrial sector
      also threatens to relocate along with a residential population feeling
    strangled by growing municipal and school taxes on real property. A few cities
    have reached
      beyond taxation of property and sales to impose one more &#8212; an income
      tax &#8212; on top of the others. And greater reliance upon user fees and
      on privatized services shifts the burden increasingly to the poor. ...</p>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</strong></p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
    leaders have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e., on
    land value)
      or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their homes
      and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
    and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
      their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any
    threat to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling
      their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
      that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
    facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a
    reverse mortgage.
      But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
    benefit of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
      not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
      from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs. <strong>In
      this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits constitutes
      a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is both
      unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater good. </strong>... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Renewal</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Established cities could adopt
some very practical long-term
measures that will make the city a place where people can and will
want to live, work, and play in safety. What few city leaders
understand is the destructive role that taxation has played in the
out-migration of people and business.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is needed is a continuously
self-renewing city and a public
policy that can work effectively. Buildings have a limited useful
life. Continuous maintenance and frequent retrofitting sometimes
extends this life span. Other buildings reach a point where they
should be replaced. Some buildings sit vacant for decades even in the
city's central business district. Valuable parcels of land are left
undeveloped or paved over and used as surface parking lots. The
result is a lower tax base and an eyesore.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As urban buildings deteriorate,
owners often don't renovate,
remodel or make repairs because their property tax may rise. Thus the
typical property tax creates suburban sprawl and urban decay.
Shifting the property tax off buildings and onto land reverses these
processes. Taxing land more than buildings usually reduces taxes for
homeowners.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One means that has long been
available but not brought into
general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
market for speculation a costly proposition. An annual fee on land
should be set near what the land site alone would yield if rented by
the owner to the highest bidder. Think of how this would change the
behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of land with a rental
value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged me as
my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would
either develop the land myself or put it on the market so that
someone else would develop it. At the same time, if my tax rate on
the building I constructed on the land was zero, my incentive is to
construct a building that maximizes my cash flow (i.e., to develop
the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At minimum,
land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto the
market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to
builders would tend to begin to fall over time.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is where the anti-sprawl
component appears. As the city
begins to renew itself -- as property owners are no longer penalized
when they renovate or build new structures -- businesses and people
will increasingly see the city as a more desirable place and not just
in a few neighborhoods that now benefit by abatement programs and
public subsidies.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Exempting property improvements
from taxation and collecting all
of the property tax from land values (which are created by the
community as a whole and not by individuals) is the cornerstone to
continuous self-renewal and the reduction of urban sprawl. Community
leaders, residents and business owners can discuss how this renewal
will take place, to ensure that neighborhoods retain existing
amenities and create new ones that will make every neighborhood vital
and attractive. By correcting this serious structural flaw in tax
policy that has existed for so long, people will gradually return to
city, contributing to its self-renewal.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By utilizing land within cities
efficiently and in response to the
demand for its use, open space and natural habitats outside the city
will be conserved. If urban land is used to its highest and best use,
farm land and environmentally sensitive land will not be required for
inappropriate uses. Builders and developers would not have to bypass
serviced but vacant land to construct housing at a further distance
from where it is needed or wanted.&nbsp; ... <a
