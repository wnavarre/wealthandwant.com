<blockquote>
  <p>We do something that, when you think of it, is quite odd.&nbsp; We require
    our young people, if they want to live on their own (that is, not with their
    parents), to pay someone else for something which that other person did
    not create &#8212; could not <em>possibly</em> have created!&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Renters in almost
      all cities are paying a significant share of their monthly rent bill not
    for the apartment, hallways,
      landscaping, parking and other amenities created by the landlord, but for
      the <em><strong>location</strong></em>!&nbsp; The landlord didn't create
      the location, didn't do anything to make it more valuable.&nbsp; If
      you doubt this, consider the likely monthly rent on an identical unit
      if it were located in a small town.&nbsp; How much could
      the building owner charge for similar quarters there?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Similarly,
      when a young person buys a house or condominium, much* of their payment
    is for
      the
      <em><strong>location</strong></em>      rather
      than the house, buildings and other manmade improvements.&nbsp; The seller
      leaves town with a nest egg, and the young person is left with a sizeable
      mortgage payment for much of his adult life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">[*A 2006 Federal Reserve Board study suggests that as
        of 2004, land represents, on average, about 51% of single family home
        value across 46 major metropolitan areas, ranging
        from 20% in Oklahoma City to 89% in San Francisco.]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When wages were rising rapidly, we told ourselves that this was acceptable,
    that the mortgage payment would not be a significant burden for very long.&nbsp; When
    women were entering the workforce in large numbers, and moving from part-time
    work to full-time work, from work requiring less education to work requiring
    more education, their additional wages helped fund this.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Now that wages are no longer rising much, and there aren't all that many
      non-employed women who could enter the labor market to increase total earnings,
      we may be reaching the point where this way of doing things creates sufficient
      pain that people will be moved to take another look at the justice of the
      situation.</p>
  <p>We say we have a housing affordability problem. True, sort of. The problem
    is not that people can't afford housing itself. Rather, what they can't afford
    is housing in a location close to their work. So they &quot;drive until they
    qualify&quot;
(not just on their househunting expedition, but every day) and in addition to
the
money
they
spend
to
pay
off
the
seller or the landlord, they must also spend time and money on a long commute,
and in
the
process
    produce pollution that simply would not occur if they could afford to live
    closer to their jobs.</p>
  <p>California and Florida are the very worst for housing affordability. Much
    of this can be attributed to perverse property tax provisions &#8212; California's
    Proposition 13 and Florida's &quot;Save Our Homes&quot; &#8212; which ignore
    all but a tiny fraction of the appreciation of land. California's assessments
    can rise no more than 2% per year, even when some sites are appreciating
    by 20% or more per year; Florida's permanent residents' assessments rise
    by only 3% per year. California's situation is made worse by a cap on property
    taxes at 1% of assessed value. This has encouraged land prices to rise far
    higher than they would had the land tax been higher. (Land represents 63.8%
    to 88.5% of the value of single family residential property in California's
    cities in 2004, according to a 2006 Federal Reserve Board Study; the corresponding
    figure for the largest 46 metro markets is 50%.)</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
      of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual
      the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
      are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in
      every scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.</p>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
      limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation,
    if the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which
    could not
      be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
      Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
      and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more
      desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and light
    could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied to
    each house
      at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual effort,
      or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to give
    every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident,
      the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be increased
      burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York would become
      a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn taxation
    as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision,
      as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our States
    has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon
      the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is the
    far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his proposition
    that
      all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain brief term &#8212; a
      proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth that the earth
      belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have no control over
      it, and can
      give no title to any part of it. But restriction upon public debts is a
      very different thing from restriction upon the power of taxation, and reasons
      which
      urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor is increased taxation necessarily
      proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in taxation is in the order
      of social development, for the reason that social development tends to
      the doing
      of things collectively that in a ruder state are done individually, to
      the giving to government of new functions and the imposing of new duties.
      Our public
      schools and libraries and parks, our signal service and fish commissions
      and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations, are evidences
      of this.</p>
  <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the method
      of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
      to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
      him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of a
      cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
      So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
      a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
      would hardly be felt. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
    <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
        distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
        and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
        is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
        labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
        For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
        is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
        of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
        lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
        value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
        most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
        the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
        while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
        only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
        possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
        in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
        of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
        are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
        distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
        what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
    <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
        it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general
      prosperity, it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of
      revenue while
        there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land.
      We may tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree
      lessening
        the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to
      use land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to
      the production
        of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. <strong>We might take
        the whole value of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land
        worth
        nothing, and
        the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
        be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its
        capabilities, which are brought out by increased population. </strong>But
        impose anything like such taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to
        the production of wealth would
        be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
        would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon
        be the silence of desolation. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

The single tax would do this by discouraging the cornering of land which now
makes all good lots scarce. When land was no longer appropriated except for use,
and that would result from the operation of the single tax, there would be an
abundance of building lots to be had for the taking, which would be far more

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q38. What are the three legs of the tripos, the threefold support upon
      which the single tax rests?</em><br>
A. They are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) The social origin of ground rent -- that the site value of land is
      a creation of the community, a public or social value.<br>
    (2) The non-shiftability of a land tax -- that no tax, new or old, on the
    site value of land can be recovered from the tenant or user by raising his
    rent.<br>
    (3) The ultimate burdenlessness of a land tax -- that the selling value of
    land, reduced as it is by the capitalized tax that is imposed upon it, is
    an untaxed value. Whatever lowers the income from land lowers proportionately
    its selling price, so that whether the established tax upon it has been light
    or heavy, it is no burden upon the new purchaser, who buys it at its net
    value and thus escapes all part in the tax burden which he should in justice
    share with those who now bear it all.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Q58. What expected result of the single tax needs studious emphasis?</em><br>
A. That it would unlock the land to labor at its present value for use, instead
  of locking out labor from the land by a prohibitive price based upon the future
  value for use.... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

      to return land to its so-called &quot;rightful owners&quot; given land
      reform a bad name?</em></p>
  <p>JES: That's true, but it doesn't have to be done that way. Now, one of the
    things that is again in the spirit of Henry George is that, if you have land
    taxes, then the market value of land goes down. What you're willing to pay
    for land is the difference between what you pay and what you get to keep
    after paying your land taxes. So, in a Henry George world, the amount of
    compensation would be very low. So one could argue that moving toward a land
    tax would facilitate that reform. Once we raise rates on land taxes, the
    market value will have to go down. The government can buy the land and redistribute
    it to the workers, and they then would be able to keep the fruits of their
    labor. They will continue to pay the land tax, but the product of their own
    efforts &#8212; their labor &#8212; will be their own, as opposed to sharing
    fifty percent with the landlord.</p>
  <p><em>Q: Do you think land reform could possibly find a way onto the political
    agenda in the United States?</em></p>
  <p>JES: No. Land reform is not a big issue in the United States because we
    don't have a lot of sharecropping. There's some, but it's very limited. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. <strong>For as soon as any piece
    of land will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar
    labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.</strong>    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax men,
    would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic, storekeeper,
    or professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives,
    and
      which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family
    cannot be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary,
    he
      will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish -- theoretically
      it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear.
    It will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other
    lots
      will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
      of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser

    a loser
      by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful

    a larger lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of
    their own,
      he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present,
    other things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have
    more
      taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house
    and improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that
    he and
      his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
      by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
      of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
      another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    a Cause of Poverty</a> (1909 speech in Parliament)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I do not think the Leader of the
Opposition could have chosen a
more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of
that great community for land was for not more than forty acres a
year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does
that really represent the complete economic and natural demand for
the amount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I
will admit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford
to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room
tenements; and we are told that the utmost land those people can
absorb economically and naturally is forty acres a year.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the explanation? Because
the population is congested in
the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
congested within the city. That is the position which we are
complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
hitherto dominated civilised society.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But when we seek to rectify this
system, to break down this
unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it is <span

But that personality has been used to
exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,

soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
life should become larger than it is at present.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the position disclosed
by the argument? On the one hand,
we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
spreads and who would not really be in the least injured.... <a

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It does not matter whether the tax is based on the land value or the land
    rent. I suggest basing it on the land value, similar to current real property
    taxes. The price of land is related to the rent by a formula, where <strong>p
    is the price</strong>, <strong>r the annual ren</strong>t (assuming constant rents), <strong>i
    the real interest rate</strong>  (after subtracting the inflation rate), and <strong>t
    the tax rate on the price</strong> (so
    if t = .1, the tax is 10 percent of p):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>p = r / (i+t).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fraction f of the rent taken is</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>f = t / (t+i)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively, given the fraction of the rent that is taxed, the tax rate
    on the land price p, given interest rate i, is</p>
  <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>t = fi / (1-f),</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>i.e. the (fraction of rent) times (the real interest rate) divided by (one
    minus the fraction).</p>
  <p>For example, suppose we want to tax 80 percent of the geo-rent, hence f=.8.
    Suppose the real interest rate is 5 percent, hence i=.05. Then the tax rate
    on land value is:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>t = .80 * .05 / .20 = .04/.20 = 20 percent.</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A tax of 20 percent of land value taps 80 percent of the economic rent. Note
    that the land price falls as either the interest rate or the tax rate rises.
    The approximate ratio of the price of taxed land to non-taxed land is:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i / (i + t)</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So if t is 20 percent and i is 5 percent, then the price of the taxed land
    would be about one-fifth of the price of the untaxed land. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
      state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
      with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. <strong>Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. </strong>The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation.</p>
  <p>One must be careful not to confuse <em>land-value</em> with the <em>price
        of land</em>. <strong>The
      price of land is the sum demanded for the transference from one individual
      to another of the privilege to collect and retain land-value and thus to divert
      public earnings to private pockets.</strong>... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

Affordable</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The implementation of our ideas
would have a dramatic effect in
making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held
off the market by speculators who may wait generations do decide to
develop it.</span> The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether
used or not, equal to the rental value of the land, will induce
speculators to either develop this land themselves or turn it over to
someone who will.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who
wishes to own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying
the title to the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of
the house itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a
fee equal to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of
land titles became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a
family would have to borrow to purchase a house would fall....&nbsp; <a

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical
resolutions and synergies<br>
</a>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Untaxing buildings obviously
draws in outside capital, which is
good locally, but is not capital formation to the whole economy. In
Keynesian models, higher income leads to higher saving, and does
create new capital. Supply-siders today worry more about raising the
rate of saving from any given income. In supply-side models it is
more important to increase the rate of saving, without depending
entirely on the Keynesian effect, where higher income raises saving.
Also, from the nationalist viewpoint, it is better to supply
investable funds from domestic savings, to minimize foreign
ownership. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land taxation helps here, too.
Land taxation, if heavy enough to
count, lowers the investment value of land, through "tax
capitalization". There is a diminishing marginal utility of savings
to any wealth-holder, meaning the more you have, the less you need
more. With land devalued, those needing wealth seek substitute
assets to replace land in their portfolios. To acquire those
additional assets they must save more, and invest the savings in real
new capital, rather than land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, Georgist taxation meets the
proper goals of supply-side
economics: raising output, and raising saving. It reconciles
supply-side economics with taxation by providing a mode of taxation
that stimulates instead of dragging down production and employment.

The
impact of land taxes is analogous to that of credit sales. The

higher level of deferred payments. The net effect is like extending
permanent credit on equal terms to all potential buyers, something
private credit markets never do or could be expected to do. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, the property tax, especially

an instrument of Distributive Socialism. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>To send a clear message to new businesses
that their growth will not be unnecessarily impeded, government can
permanently shift taxes off sales, income, and buildings and onto land.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Since taxing land lowers its cost,
business could pay this greater land
tax from what otherwise would be spent on purchasing land. </span>This
higher
land levy would remain affordable as long as owners use their land
efficiently.<br>
<br>
Developers argue that abundant land lowers its price and thus the
property tax burden. While true, newly-available land need not be
current open space. Without baring the countryside to new development,
both land price and the property tax can be lowered. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The price of land
drops when the tax rate on land is raised. And yet this higher rate, if
coupled with a lower or absent rate on buildings, does not swell the
property tax burden of most residents. </span>Indeed, this <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">property tax shift
(PTS)</span> is progressive, providing relief for most residents. And
by
taxing land, society impels owners who had been speculatively
withholding or underutilizing theirs to develop or offer their parcels
for development. Hence the newly-available land comes from recycled
sites, not from open space.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The PTS not only lowers the price of
land, it also lowers the cost of
buildings.</span> Untaxing structures, besides reducing their cost,
also
augments their supply. More buildings means lower prices and rents. As
the prices of both buildings and land drop, more people are able to
purchase a home, apartment, or condominium. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<blockquote>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</strong></p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
    leaders have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e., on
    land value)
      or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their homes
      and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
    and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
      their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any
    threat to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling
      their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
      that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
    facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a
    reverse mortgage.
      But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
    benefit of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
      not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
      from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs.
      In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits
      constitutes
      a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is
      both unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater
      good.... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

as an Alternative to Rental and Private Ownership for Agricultural Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the advocates of rental
    and the advocates of private ownership of agricultural land is that each position
    has important strengths as well as important weaknesses. This paper argues
    that there is a third possibility between rental and private ownership that
    retains the strengths of both while avoiding the weaknesses of both. The third
    possibility is private possession of land.</p>
  <p><b>I. The Concept of Private Possession of Land</b></p>
  <p>Like private ownership, a system of private possession of land involves titles
    to land that have no termination date and are freely transferable. Therefore
    the possessor of land can be confident of receiving the full benefit of any
    improvements that are made to land. Like rental, a system of private possession
    of land involves an obligation to make regular payments to the government for
    the use of land. However, the payment is not for the full rental value of land,
    but only for the rental value that land would have in an unimproved condition.
    This collection by the government of the value that is provided by nature and
    location gives recognition to the idea that land is the common heritage of
    all generations, and should be available to all generations on the same terms.
    It insures that prices for titles of possession will correspond only to the
    cost of improvements, and will therefore not be excessive. It eliminates the
    profit from land speculation. And it provides a continuing source of government
    revenue. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Private%20Possession.html">read the whole

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to Henry
    George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George applied these
    inherent differences between land and products was the field of taxation.
    To determine the incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be
    taxed, products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
    from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes upon things
    of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted
    from seller to buyer, increasing as they go. ...If we impose a tax upon buildings,
    the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
    will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit
    and the tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
    from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest upon
    consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the government. Now,
    the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
    supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon...[land
    value] cannot check supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels
    the land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the
    use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. <strong>On
    the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation to sell or
    let for what they can get, a tax on land values tends to increase the competition
    between owners, and thus to reduce the price of land."</strong> ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
