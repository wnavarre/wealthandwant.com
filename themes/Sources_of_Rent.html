<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In tapping
these many varieties of
resources and tenures for
public revenues, citizens and their representatives may have to set
priorities. Two practical criteria rise to the top: </small></p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>go first for the
big values, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>go for the soft targets.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
biggest values are probably in
energy, communications, water,
rights-of-way, zoning and street use.</span> Let's just look at what we
are
learning about <span style="font-weight: bold;">communications</span>.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Knowledge and entertainment
appear
both at top and bottom on man's hierarchy of needs.</span> People
without
even adequate shelter may be seen huddled around tv sets; people in
war, or under totalitarian governments, risk their lives to hear
smuggled broadcasts. People with higher incomes and security equip
themselves with mobile telephones, and call around the world; they
rush to get on the information highway. AT&amp;T was the biggest
non-financial corporation in the world before splitting up.
Newspapers depend on their "wire" services: one of the first Great
American Monopolies was Western Union and its news appendage, AP.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent
FCC auctions have fetched
billions of dollars for spectrum
licenses, but this is like selling the badlands after giving away the
beachfronts. </span>The values of extant licenses given away ion the
past,
especially spectrum in top locations, are much higher. AT&amp;T
recently paid $112.5 billion for the McCaw Company's spectrum
licenses, which are a smattering of all that is out there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
licenses should be on the property tax rolls in the jurisdictions
that they cover. </span>The revenue possibilities are staggering.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How
about soft targets? </span>A
soft target is any tenure recently
created, in a field that is easy to understand. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>come to
mind. In the last few years governments in Canada and the U.S. have
limited allowable fish hauls by excluding new fishing boats and
imposing quotas on the owners of old ones. This "imposition" amounts
to a gift. Some quotas swiftly rose in value to over $1 million each,
suddenly creating a class society where before there was equal
opportunity. There is now a class of nouveau, instant millionaires
and parlor fisherman who rent out their quotas to working
fishermen.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very
likely it is wise to limit
fish catches and avoid the
"tragedy of the commons." It is also necessary to police the waters
and keep out alien interlopers, a dicey business calling for the full
power of a strong national government. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not necessary, however,
to give away the quotas so dearly policed.</span></span> It is obvious
to any
objective observer that the quotas should be sold or (better) leased
to the highest bidder. If the Feds insist on giving them away, states
and localities should class them as taxable property subject to a
high rate. The best time to levy appropriate charges is when quotas
are new, and the injustice of the present dispensation is apparent to
all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another soft target is the
Manhattan taxi license, or "medallion."
For some reason this has long been a favorite object lesson among
economists, even as they shut their eyes to grosser sources of rent.
It may be because cabbies are rude and visible and lower class, but
whatever the reasons these writers have shown their consciousness of
the rent aspect of medallions, and raised the consciousness of
others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason for pursuing soft
targets is not for the money they may
yield, but for principle. Once the principle is understood and
established, wider applications should follow. In economic principle,
fishing quotas and taxi medallions are just like conventional land
titles: privileged control over limited natural resources. If it
makes sense to socialize the rent from quotas and medallions, why not
land titles too?... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"

<blockquote>
  <p>    I premise we understand "rent" to mean the income imputable to natural
              resources, and natural resources means gifts of nature, fixed and
    limited in quantity. We understand there are marginal resources yielding little
              or no rent, grading up to superior ones yielding much. We understand
              there is a dynamic secular tendency for rents to rise with rising
    population
              and moreso with rising disposable income per capita. There is a tendency
              for marginal exhaustible resources to rise in value with the depletion
              of superior ones that are normally
    used up first.</p>
  <p>Because land is not produced, rents may be zero or less, and rise without
    limit. There is no competition from new production.</p>
  <p>I premise resource rents are the joint product of three distinguishable factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>nature;</li>
    <li>complementary private activity; and</li>
    <li>public works and services, publicly financed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I premise rent is the most basic and general source of taxable surplus, especially
      in an open economy in which other input costs and product prices are set at
    world levels in world markets.</p>
  <p>Triffin's epigram says <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Surpluses are either
        competed away or imputed away." Rent is what we call it when they are imputed
        away. He might have added, they may also be frittered away: that is what
      we seek to avoid.</span></p>
  <p>Imputed rent is the foregone gain of withholding land from the market, i.e.
      from others. It is equal to the marginal product of land. I premise (some
      others differ) that rent is the prior distributive claim, not a "residual." Thus,
      unused valuable land costs the owner as much rent as though he were paying
      cash to a landlord. Failure to realize this rent is imputable to management,
    not land as such.</p>
  <p>Rent is a levelized concept to give a unitary, commensurable expression to
      costs and yields that have variable time patterns. Selecting time patterns
      optimally is part of maximizing rent. That is<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> a fortiori </span>true of exhaustible resources.

  * public buildings --</p>
  <p>utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the character
    of the government; which collectively constitute the economic and social
    advantages of the land which are due to the presence and activity of population,
    and are inseparable therefrom, including the benefit of proximity to, and
    command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world -- an
    artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes. For
    the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently
    expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is ordinarily measured
    by interest on investment plus taxes. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
