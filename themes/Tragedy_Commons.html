of the (unmanaged) Commons</span></div>
<p><br>
  Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Access to land is open by nature
until and unless land is
appropriated, defended, bounded and policed.&nbsp; No one claims land
by
right of production; no producer must be rewarded to evoke and maintain
the supply; and submarginal land is not worth policing, unless to
preempt
it for its possible future values, or to preclude anticipated
competition
for markets or labor.&nbsp; Centuries of human customs have developed
around regulating common use of lands with open access.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Tenure control of some land tends to drive the excluded
population to
untenured land (the "commons"), creating an allocational bias
unless all land is either tenured or common.&nbsp; Thomas N. Carver
styled this the phenomenon of "<span style="font-style: italic;">The
Congested Frontier</span>", and he
might have added backwoods.&nbsp; Land which is partly common today
includes parks and public beaches, streets and highways, water
surfaces,
wild fish and game, and some at least of the "wide open spaces"
in less hospitable regions.&nbsp; Today there are homeless people for
whom life would literally be impossible without some form of access,
however precarious, to untenured land.&nbsp; Some of it, ironically, is
near the centers of large cities, where the price of land is
highest.</small><br>
<br>
<small>No great damage is done if submarginal land is untenured: it
won't be
used anyway.&nbsp; There may be damage, however, when rentable land is
untenured.&nbsp; It attracts too many entrepreneurs with too much labor
and capital, leading either to the use of private force to establish
tenure - unjust,&nbsp;dangerous, and wasteful
&#8211;
or overcrowding and waste, called the "dissipation of rent,"
when the average cost of the average firm equals the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">average </span>product of
labor and capital.&nbsp; Fisheries and open range are classic
cases.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Some land of high value is untenured or underpriced because
consumers
resist paying for what they think of as "free" because it has
no cost of production, and which nature continues to supply even though
the price is too low to ration the land economically.&nbsp; Examples:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>water whose natural source is in southern California (it
is tenured,
but
underpriced); 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>city streets for movement and parking space, even in New
York; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>air and water used for waste disposal in populated areas; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>housing
that is subject to rent controls; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>popular beaches and trails; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>oil and
gas
subject to field price controls; and so on.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>When land is open to
public access, so maybe the capital used to
improve
it, e.g. paving of rights-of-way.&nbsp; Such capital may also suffer
the "tragedy of the commons" of excessive congestion.&nbsp; This open
access to capital is mainly an
incident to the lack of land tenure - a characteristic more of land
than
of capital as such.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">26</span></small>.</small><br>
Remember, capital occupies space, but land <em>is</em> space.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">26.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The
question of
public restrooms is unpleasant but essential.&nbsp; It is a question
whether to describe this as access to public capital or to the
waste-disposal aspect of land, but viewed as the latter it is as
undeniable a natural right as one can imagine.&nbsp; The late Arthur
Becker was one of the few to elevate this lowly, embarrassing topic
from
being a subject of evasive scatological humor to the
philosophical/ethical level it really deserves.&nbsp; A society may
quickly be read, and in part judged, by its public restrooms.&nbsp; Consider
this jointly with the matter of the homeless in crowded
cities.</font><br>
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is also possible to legislate and subsidize open access to
some
kinds
of labor and capital services, e.g. public health measures, and
education.&nbsp; These differ from common lands in that they are not
open
"by nature," but by art and public expenditure. <a

Mason Gaffney<span style="font-weight: bold;"> -- </span><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">Canada's System of Revenue Sharing<br>
</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me therefore that we
need to face up to the question
that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
Federalism, that is, how is money
going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities? ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The reason it's so hard
to sell growth policies at the local level
today in the United States is very much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he
United States federal government taxes people and it gives
subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to landlords. So the
landlords can get the
subventions without having the people. So who needs people?</span>
That's it
in a nutshell. We need to reverse that, I think, if we're going to be
able to make Georgism work at the local level. ... </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between
the federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both
countries we find something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which
means that the senior governments send money to the junior
governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the
poorer governments, those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than
to richer ones. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's Law</span>.
... But the general idea is, you may
think you have tenure control of land but if the municipal government
can tax that land and use that money to finance public welfare
services, public education and other things that are open to all
comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution of
population. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>At the same time, in both countries you find something I will
call
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammer's Law</span>. This is not a
carpenter's tool but again the name of a
man, an economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that if you
compared population to land values in the different counties of his
State (in the very poor counties of the Ozarks the land was hard
scrabble land of very little value, with the very rich lands in the
north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you found that
the population density was much greater on the very poor land of the
Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Now another similarity to the two countries us that the
subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
you remember means equalization among the different
jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something
like
that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose
Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
similarities.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
Washington. ... So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
But that's another story.) <strong>...</strong></small><small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful
distinction about Canadians is the strong
and explicit recognition among almost everyone, even if he's an
economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span>
<b>Equalisation in Canadian politics means sharing the economic
rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a
permissible word in polite discourse. It's very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However
there's a very selective attitude towards rent -- towards what rents
are shareable, I should say.</span> </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Forest revenues are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Water power is fair game. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents that
are generated by the valuable
lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big and
powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair
game.</i></b> As a matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print
of the equalization law, which I did on the airplane, you find the
most interesting exception to what's included in the formula. I'll
explain the formula to you in a moment if you are still awake. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let's look at the sharing
formula. <b>The sharing formula in
Canada is essentially based on population and potential tax base.</b>
And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've boiled
it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax
base that it has, subtract that and that gives you another
percentage. And then you multiply that times the total tax revenue
that's collected throughout Canada from that tax source, and then you
pay them that amount out of the provincial treasury. ... </b></small><small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conclusion of all this is that
the Canadian system is
really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described,
are essentially based on population. Population is in the formula.
And if you compare this with the way things are done in the States,
population plays a very minor role in the formula for equalisation
payments in the United States. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, how should it be done?
Well, there's a well known Georgist
economist who figured this out a long time ago and wrote an article
about it. His name is Colin Clark. ... He came up with a plan for
collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what we
really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation
payment, is <i>we should classify local jurisdictions according to
land value per capita, and those that have the least land value per
capita, we'll leave all of that land value for them to use for local
purposes. But then we will graduate the federal land tax according to
the amount of land value per capita in the jurisdiction, and thus we
will have a federal tax that automatically achieves inter-regional
equity, without all this razzmatazz that I've been describing about
inter-regional equalisation payments. </i><a style="font-weight: bold;"

The question before us is "how can we prevent the dissipation of
resource rents?"</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This cuts to the heart of ancient
and modern issues of land
tenure, growth management, fiscal Federalism, tax methods, and
spending priorities. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise we understand "rent"
to mean the income imputable to
natural resources, and natural resources means gifts of nature, fixed
and limited in quantity. We understand there are marginal resources
yielding little or no rent, grading up to superior ones yielding
much. We understand there is a dynamic secular tendency for rents to
rise with rising population and moreso with rising disposable income
per capita. There is a tendency for marginal exhaustible resources to
rise in value with the depletion of superior ones that are normally
used up first.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because land is not produced,
rents may be zero or less, and rise
without limit. There is no competition from new production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise resource rents are the
joint product of three
distinguishable factors:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>nature;</small></li>
  <li><small>complementary private activity; and</small></li>
  <li><small>public works and services, publicly financed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise rent is the most basic
and general source of taxable
surplus, especially in an open economy in which other input costs and
product prices are set at world levels in world markets.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Triffin's epigram says <span

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because George asserted, "We
must make land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded
as an advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was
nothing of the sort. The expropriation of land makes it practically
impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
which are their legitimate property. George's system renders to the
community what is due to the community, without doing any violence to
the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive workers.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Common property in land is sometimes discredited by equation
with what Garrett Hardin calls "<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Tragedy of the
Commons</span>." Referring to the common lands that were a major
English institution until the mid-nineteenth century, Hardin describes
the tendency of individuals, each rationally pursuing self-interest, to
overgraze, denude, and use the commons as a cesspool. That which
belongs to everybody in this sense is, indeed, in danger of being
valued and maintained by nobody.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The enclosure movement ultimately brought an end to this
ecologically destructive process, but not without literally pushing
people off the land, exacting a baneful price in human misery that
might well be termed "The Tragedy of the Enclosures." George hit upon a
way of securing the benefits of both commons and enclosures, while at
the same time avoiding their evils. Land value taxation rectifies
distribution so that all receive wealth in proportion to their
contribution to its production. This liberates the economic system from
exploiters who contribute little or nothing. Apportioning the wealth
pie fairly increases the incentive to increase the size of the pie. The
market becomes in practice what capitalist theory alleges it to be -- a
profoundly cooperative process of voluntary exchange of goods and
services. Paradoxical though it may seem, the only way the individual
may be assured what properly belongs to him or her is for society to
take what properly belongs to it: The ideal of Jeffersonian
individualism requires for its actualization the socialization of rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Just as Marxists err in insisting that everything be socialized,
extreme capitalists err in insisting that everything (even public parks
and forests!) be privatized. The middle way is to recognize society's
claim to what nature and society create -- the value of land and its
rent -- so that working people, including entrepreneurs, may claim
their full share of what they create. In this balanced approach can be
found the authentic verities respectively inherent in socialism and
individualism. <a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>    I began pondering this dilemma about ten years ago after retiring from Working
      Assets, a business I cofounded in 1982. (Working Assets offers telephone
      and credit card services which automatically donate to nonprofit groups
      working for a better world.) My initial ruminations focused on climate
      change caused by human emissions of heat-trapping gases. Some analysts
      saw this as a &#8220;tragedy of the commons,&#8221; a concept popularized
      forty years ago by biologist Garrett Hardin. According to Hardin, people
      will always overuse a commons because it&#8217;s in their self-interest
      to do so. <strong>I saw the problem instead as a pair of tragedies: </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>first a tragedy
                of the market, which has no way of curbing its own excesses,
      and </li>
    <li>second a tragedy of government, which fails to protect the atmosphere
        because
                  polluting corporations are powerful and future generations
      don&#8217;t
                  vote.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This way of viewing the situation led to a hypothesis: <strong>if the commons
      is a victim of market and government failures, rather than the cause of
      its
          own destruction, the remedy might lie in strengthening the commons.</strong> But how
          might that be done? According to prevailing wisdom, commons are inherently
          difficult to manage because no one effectively owns them. <strong>If
          Waste Management Inc. owned the atmosphere, it would charge dumpers
          a fee, just as it does
          for terrestrial landfills. But since no one has title to the atmosphere,
          dumping proceeds without limit or cost.</strong> ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>If you heard about the commons before you picked up this book, your impressions
    were probably shaped by a 1968 article called &#8220;The Tragedy of the Commons.&#8221; In
    that article, biologist Garrett Hardin used the metaphor of an unmanaged
    pasture to suggest a root cause of many planetary problems.</p>
  <p>The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to
    pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another. . . . But this
    is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons.
    Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him
    to increase his herd without limit &#8212; in a world that is limited. Ruin
    is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best
    interest. . . . Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.</p>
  <p>Hardin&#8217;s notion of tragedy was taken from philosopher Alfred North
    Whitehead, who in turn drew upon Aristotle. According to Whitehead, the essence
    of tragedy is &#8220;the remorseless working of things.&#8221; In Hardin&#8217;s
    view, commons are fated to self-destruct. There&#8217;s nothing humans can
    do in the context of the commons to halt this inexorable outcome.</p>
  <p>Hardin was right about humanity&#8217;s unrelenting destruction of nature,
    but wrong about its cause and inexorability. He blamed the commons itself,
    when the true destroyer was, and remains, forces outside the commons. In
    Hardin&#8217;s hypothetical, the commons does nothing to protect itself against
    those forces. It&#8217;s completely unmanaged. But there&#8217;s no inherent
    reason why commons can&#8217;t be managed as commons.</p>
  <p>Contrary to the picture painted by Hardin, medieval European commons (which
    included not only pastures but forests and streams) were far from unmanaged.
    They had rules barring access to outsiders and limiting use by villagers.
    For example, a rule that persists today in many Swiss villages is that villagers
    can&#8217;t graze in common pasture more animals than they can feed over
    winter on their own land. A managed commons, in other words, isn&#8217;t
    inherently self-destructive. The real danger to the commons is enclosure
    and trespass by outsiders. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>In his essay &#8220;The Tragedy of the Commons,&#8221; Garrett Hardin envisioned
    only two ways to save the commons: statism and privatism. Either a coercive
    government would have to stop humans from mindlessly destroying the planet,
    or private property owners, operating in a free market, would have to do
    the job. In the next two chapters I&#8217;ll show why neither of these approaches
    suffices.</p>
  <p>In considering the potential of governmental remedies, let&#8217;s clarify
    what we mean. We&#8217;re not talking about tyranny; we&#8217;re talking
    about legitimate forms of government activity such as regulation, taxation,
    and public ownership. Can these traditional methods effectively preserve
    common wealth for our children? ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
tragedy of the common misunderstanding</span></small><br>
<small>In their search for excuses to deny any common right to land,
royal libertarians are fond of citing Garrett Hardin's work, "Tragedy
of the Commons." Or at least they cite the title, which is all most
royal libertarians are familiar with. Hardin is himself an advocate of
land value taxation, and has criticized misinterpretations of his work
with the lament that "The title of my 1968 paper should have been `The
Tragedy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Unmanaged </span>Commons.'"
