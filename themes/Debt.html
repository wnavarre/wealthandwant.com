know of a mechanical
force more powerful than anything the vaunting engineer of Syracuse
ever dreamed of. It is the force of land monopoly; it is a screw and
lever all in one; it will screw the last penny out of a man's pocket,
and bend everything on earth to its own despotic will. </span>Give me
the
private ownership of all the land, and will I move the earth? No; but
I will do more.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> I will undertake to
make slaves of all the human
beings on the face of it. Not chattel slaves exactly, but slaves
nevertheless. What an idiot I would be to make chattel slaves of
them. I would have to find them salts and senna when they were sick,
and whip them to work when they were lazy.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No, it is not good enough. Under
the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;
they would dive into the bowels of the earth for its hidden
treasures; they would build cities and construct railways and
telegraphs; their ships would navigate the ocean; they would work and
work, and invent and contrive; their warehouses would be full, their
markets glutted, and: </small></p>

 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">That everything they made would
belong to me.</span> </b></small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see: As
I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
this case a number of those who were hard pushed would seek to
borrow, and as for those who were not so hard pushed, they would, as
a matter of course, get the idea into their heads that if they only
had more capital they could extend their operations, and thereby make
their business more profitable. Here I am again. The very man they
stand in need of; a regular benefactor of my species, and always
ready to oblige them. With such an enormous rent-roll I could furnish
them with funds up to the full extent of the available security; they
would not expect me to do more, and in the matter of interest I would
be equally generous. </span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
would allow them to fix the rate of it themselves in precisely
the same manner as they had fixed the rent. </span>I should then have
them
by the wool, and if they failed in their payments it would be the
easiest thing in the world to sell them out. They might bewail their
lot, but business is business. They should have worked harder and
been more provident. Whatever inconvenience they might suffer, it
would be their concern, and not mine. What a glorious time I would
have of it! Rent and interest, interest and rent, and no limit to
either, excepting the ability of the workers to pay. Rents would go
up and up, and they would continue to pledge and mortgage, and as
they went bung, bung, one after another, it would be the finest sport
ever seen. thus, from the simple leverage of land monopoly, not only
the great globe itself, but everything on the face of it would
eventually belong to me. I would be king and lord of all, and the
rest of mankind would be my most willing slaves.... <a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To consider what is included in the category of property is to see the absurdity
    of saying that all property should be equally taxed. For not to speak of
    minor differences that arise from application and use, there are commonly
    included under this term things of essentially different nature. Whatever
    is recognized by municipal law as subject to ownership is property. But between
    things thus classed together are wide differences. In the first place, there
    are certain of them which have in themselves no value, but are merely the
    representatives or doubles of property in itself valuable. <strong>Such are
    stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes of all kinds, whether made by
    individuals
    or issued by governments to serve as money, solvent debts, book-accounts,
    etc. These things may be to the individual valuable property, and are correctly
    included in any estimate of his wealth. But they are no part of the wealth
    of the community. Their increase does not make the community a whit the richer;
    and they may be utterly destroyed without the community becoming a whit the
    poorer. </strong>If I buy a horse, giving my note for the amount, the result
    of the transaction (supposing me to be solvent) is that the seller gets property
    to the value of the horse, while I get the horse. But there has been no increase
    in wealth. To the seller, my note may be quite as good as the horse, and
    in estimating his wealth it may be as properly included as the horse; but
    if the note be destroyed, the community is nothing the poorer, while if the
    horse break his neck, there is a lessening of the general wealth by one horse.
    And so, the issuance of bonds by a government, or the watering of stock by
    a corporation, can in no wise increase the general sum of wealth, nor will
    any diminution either in the amount or in the selling price of such bonds
    or stock reduce it.<strong> If all the governments of the world were to repudiate
    their debts tomorrow, an immense amount of property, now carefully guarded,
    would become waste paper, and thousands of people now rich would be made
    poor, but the wealth of the human race would not be diminished one iota.</strong> ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving Life to
the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... <br>
</strong><br>
<font size="3"><small><b>Economic Problems to Solve<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small>Taxing built-value penalizes
construction and
maintenance of buildings. This deadweight loss on the local economy
constrains housing supply and raises land values, driving speculation.
Fewer people can then own parcels for homes and businesses, and debt
levels increase. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small><b>PTS Improves the Economy<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small>Land that is higher taxed is
lower priced.
Cheaper land reduces buyers' debt. Less demand for loans lowers the
lending rate. Cheaper capital means more investment and more
employment. In Australia, in the province around Melbourne, some towns
levy the regular property tax, others tax only land. Those with the
same rate for sites and structures suffer more bankruptcies; those with
one rate for land enjoy more successful business start-ups. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Developers might learn to like the PTS, since
financial loss does not
necessarily follow. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>First, tho' the land tax would
preclude a huge
profit from a few sales, it would also, by unplugging effective demand
for housing, create many more sales of smaller profit. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Second, instead
of profiting from locational values, they could make more money --
untaxed -- by adding value, such as total weatherization, heat pumps,
light tubes, built-in wiring for the cyber-house, etc. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Third, to buy
land, developers would not need to go so deeply into debt. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Fourth, by
building on central sites, they could drastically reduce their systems
development charges, which, were they pegged to full costs, would be up
to $30,000 in Oregon. 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>For these four reasons, developers could
break
even. <strong>... </strong></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>While the PTS is already gaining attention,
there are issues which, were they addressed, would facilitate the
spread of the idea. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>One issue is external to the
movement, lying in the
broader society. <span style="font-weight: bold;">People consider land
speculation, reaping megaprofits
from fast-developing areas, as something normal. </span>Most people
fail to
realize that there is a commonwealth of socially-generated economic
values apart from values individually-generated. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding who
creates land value is crucial to the success of the PTS. </span>While
this may
not be an issue that lends itself easily to a mass educating campaign,
some effort to raise public awareness of its own assets must be made.
In doing so, advocates would learn how best to present the distinction
between what's ours and what's not.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small>The other issue that needs to be tended to early on is
internal to the
movement. That is, the terms that package the policy often push the
wrong buttons, such as "land tax". Because the land tax works and works
well, it is tempting to use the phrase. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For instance,
high-taxed,
low-priced land would shrink the debt now weighing down the economy.
Growing debts -- both public and private -- continually and worseningly
harry workers and taxpayers.</span> Yet many people will never follow
the
explanation far enough if the policy is presented as a land tax.
Coupling collection of land rent with a reduction of taxes on labor and
capital, especially homes, might be more persuasive. Calling this
policy a "Property Tax Shift" might let proponents get a foot in the
mental door.</small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a
