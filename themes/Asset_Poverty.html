  Poverty</span></p>
  </div>
<blockquote>
  <p>In 21st century America, one respected researcher (Edward Wolff, of NYU)
      has used as criteria for asset poverty whether a family has sufficient net
      worth,
      net worth
      other
      than
      home
      equity, or liquid assets to support themselves for just three months <em>at
      the federal poverty level for their size of family</em>.&nbsp; The statistics,
      generated from a  well-documented panel study data, are distressing.&nbsp; Many
      will look at those statistics and whisper a quiet &quot;tsk! tsk!,&quot; which
      suggests an impression that those families are merely irresponsible.&nbsp; Consider
      the possibility that other dynamics are at work.</p>
  <p>A large share of the income of most households goes to paying for housing,
    either in the form of a rent check to a landlord or a mortgage check to the
    lender who paid off the previous owner of the house. An additional payment
    goes to the town in property taxes, though that usually works out to only
    a few dollars per day. But on top of that, we pay income taxes (federal,
    and in many places state, and sometimes local), sales taxes (and in some
    counties these are as high as 11%), and wage taxes. Most
    of
    these tax dollars are used for activities that help
    support property values: local services, schools, infrastructure, transportation
    systems, even military protection and emergency services. </p>
  <p>Relatively few of us have sufficient other assets to support ourselves for
    any length of time. (Is Bush's &quot;Ownership Society&quot; the answer to this? Not
    exactly, because, like other &quot;fences and bandages&quot; strategies, it doesn't
    get at the underlying problem: the privatization of the rent on what should
    be our common assets. First things first. The &quot;ownership&quot; problem will fix
    itself once we've corrected the underlying distortion. Small measures that
    don't, in Thoreau's words, hack at the root of evil, will not succeed, though
    they will occupy our attention for long periods.)</p>
  <p>But even those who haven't read Wolff's  work know something now they
    didn't know in the early summer of 2005, before Katrina: that thousands of
    people
    in one of our larger cities lacked sufficient means to evacuate in the face
    of a hurricane that threatened to flood the city. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BUT it will be asked: If the land system which prevails in Ireland
    is essentially the same as that which prevails elsewhere, how is it
    that it does not produce the same results elsewhere?</p>
  <p>I answer that it does everywhere produce the same kind of results.
    As there is nothing essentially peculiar in the Irish land system, so
    is there nothing essentially peculiar in Irish distress. Between the
    distress in Ireland and the distress in other countries there may be
    differences in degree and differences in manifestation; but that is
    all.<strong> ...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>When there is famine among savages it is because food enough is
    not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
    Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
    food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
    in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
    scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
    scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
    exported from Ireland to England</strong>, which would not have been the case
    had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
    During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
    American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
    the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
    have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
    war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
    ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
    superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
    display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
    its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
    Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
    draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
    relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
    than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
    reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
    the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
    it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
    might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
    Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
    flow of more abundant harvests.</p>
  <p>I wish clearly to bring to view this point. The Irish famine was
    not a true famine arising from scarcity of food. It was what an
    English writer styled the Indian famine &#8211; a "financial famine," arising
    not from scarcity of food but from the poverty of the people. The effect
    of the short crops in producing distress was not so much
    in raising the price of food as in cutting off the accustomed incomes
    of the people. The masses of the Irish people get so little in
    ordinary times that they are barely able to live, and when anything
    occurs to interrupt their accustomed incomes they have nothing to
    fall back on. ...<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a
