<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">Significant
      Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
      14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
      X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p><strong>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men,
        and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely offers
      to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice </strong>&#8212; for,
      so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
      to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
      asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
      ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
      </strong>Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, <strong>merely the liberty to compete for
      employment at starvation wages</strong>. This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p><strong>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when
        she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think
        of her
      as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have not seen
      her real grandeur</strong> &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her
      must seem rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of
      life, as well
      as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all
      growth, supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be
      a cold and inert
      mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty to
      mankind. It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that
      in every age
      the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have
      suffered.</p>
  <p><strong>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge,
        invention, national strength, and national independence as other things.
        But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition.</strong> ...</p>
  <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
      among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
  <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay.<strong> It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
      Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! </strong>Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.</strong> This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p><strong>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse.</strong> It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue.</strong> The eternal laws
    of the universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness
    that is in every soul answers,
      that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something
    more august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
        to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
        come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays
        on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. </strong>We
        degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would
        have better ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such
        an ulcerous
        ant-hill! It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the
        vice and misery that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers
        upon us
        his gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
        food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while
        we tear and rend each other!</p>
  <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
        enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
        nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
        the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into
        being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air;
        fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
        spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold!
        Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit
        would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the
        material universe could be utilized only through land.</p>
  <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
        know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under our
        very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that
        Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which
        maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made, has
        increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
        of nature had been increased. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
          of mankind. </li>
    <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels the
      lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
    <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
    <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
      of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
      the
          same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
        with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings
        while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few
        are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every page may be read
        the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that
        follows
        injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state
        of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After us the deluge!&quot; Nay;
        the pillars of the State are trembling even now, and the very foundations
        of
        society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The
        struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand,
        if it be
        not already begun.</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying
          the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
      gather for the strife!</p>
  <p><strong>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,
        if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear,<em> the
        forces that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation.</em> </strong>Think
        of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored;
        of the possibilities of which the wondrous inventions of this century give
        us but a hint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> With want destroyed;</li>
    <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
    <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
      jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
    <li> with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
    <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Words fail the thought! <strong>It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
        and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which
        has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw
        whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the
        City of God on earth, with its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It
        is the reign of the Prince of Peace!</strong> ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read the whole

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... But there are people, who,
looking around on the suffering and
injustice with which, even in so-called Christian countries, human
life is full, say there is no Father in Heaven, there can be no God,
or He would not permit this. How superficial is that thought!<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When we consider the achievements
of humanity and then look upon
the misery that exists today in the very centres of wealth; upon the
ignorance, the weakness, the injustice, that characterise our highest
civilisation, we may know of a surety that it is not the fault of
God; it is the fault of humanity. May we not know that in that very
power that God has given to His children here, in that power of
rising higher, there is involved &#8212; and necessarily involved
&#8212; the power of falling lower. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All-Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There was a little dialogue
published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small> Thus it happens that all over
  the civilised world that class
  that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
  class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
  never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
  and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
  lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
  forth.</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Early Christianity did not mean,
in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.
If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What was persecuted was a great
movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
It struck at the very basis of that monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached.</small> <small>... <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Read

Henry George: <a href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html">Ode to
Liberty&nbsp;</a> (1877 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE HONOR LIBERTY in name and in
form. We set up her statues and
sound her praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our
growth so grow her demands. She will have no half service! Liberty! it
is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings. For
Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law of
health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission
when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the
ballot, who think of her as having no further relations to the
everyday affairs of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to
them the poets who have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her
martyrs fools!<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth,
knowledge, invention, national strength and national independence as
other things. But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother,
the necessary condition.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Our primary social
adjustment is a denial of justice. In
allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
as material progress goes on. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the subtle alchemy that in
ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
civilized country the fruits of their weary toil</span>; that is
instituting
a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
anarchy. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is this that turns the
blessings of material progress into a
curse.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that
attributes to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering
and brutishness that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to
the All-Father and lays on Him the responsibility for the want and
crime of our great cities. We degrade the Everlasting. We slander the
Just One.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> But if,
while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey
her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
threaten must disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to
agencies of elevation. </span>Think of the powers now wasted; of the
infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?
Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
vision which has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor.
It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is
the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the City of God on earth, with
its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is the reign of the
Prince of Peace!&nbsp; ... <a href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the unduly rich are the
corollary of the unduly poor, so is
the soul-destroying quality of riches but the reflex of the want that
embrutes and degrades. The real evil lies in the injustice from which
unnatural possession and unnatural deprivation both spring.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This injustice can hardly be
charged on individuals or
classes. The existence of private property in land is a great social
wrong from which society at large suffers, and of which the very rich
and the very poor are alike victims, though at the opposite extremes.
Seeing this, if seems like a violation of Christian charity to speak of
the rich as though they individually were responsible for the
sufferings of the poor. Yet many do this while at the same time
insisting that land monopoly, the cause of monstrous wealth and
degrading poverty, shall not be touched.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In seeking to restore to all men
their equal and natural
rights we do not seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both
know by faith and see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that
justice must benefit all. Nor do we seek any futile and ridiculous
equality. We recognise that there must always be differences and
inequalities. In so far as these are in conformity with the moral law,
in so far as they do not violate the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221;
we are content.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The equality we would bring about
is not the equality of
fortune, but the equality of natural opportunity; the equality that
reason and religion alike proclaim &#8211; the equality in usufruct of all
His children to the bounty of Our Father Who art in Heaven!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In doing this, we would not levy
the slightest tax on the
possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only do we deem such taxes a
violation of the right of
property, but we see that it is impossible for any one to produce

Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. </span>When land
increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Increase of
land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor.</span> Consider </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation --

  <li><small>how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation; </span>    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">that the reason why those
who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other.</span> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small> That individuals are constantly
  making their way from the
  ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
  who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
  right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
  pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
  piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
  it.</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am not denouncing the rich,
nor seeking, by speaking of

around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital
is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</span></span></small></div>

they will but use that reason. And some things it may be there are, that &#8212; as

THAT thought on social questions is so confused and perplexed, that the aspirations
of great bodies of men, deeply though vaguely conscious of injustice, are in
all civilized countries being diverted to futile and dangerous remedies, is largely
due to the fact that those who assume and are credited with superior knowledge
of social and economic laws have devoted their powers, not to showing where the
injustice lies but to hiding it; not to clearing common thought but to confusing
it. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm">A Perplexed Philosopher</a></em><a href="APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm"> (Conclusion)<br>

POLITICAL economy is the simplest of the sciences. It is but the intellectual
recognition, as related to social life, of laws which in their moral aspect men
instinctively recognize, and which are embodied in the simple teachings of him
whom the common people heard gladly. But, like Christianity, political economy
has been warped by institutions which, denying the equality and brotherhood of
man, have enlisted authority, silenced objection, and ingrained themselves in
custom and habit of thought. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter

      <br>
  </span> THE power of a special interest, though inimical to the general interest,
  so to influence common thought as to make fallacies pass as truths, is a great
  fact, without which neither the political history of our own time and people,
  nor that of other times and peoples, can be understood. A comparatively small
  number of individuals brought into virtual though not necessarily formal agreement
  of thought and action by something that makes them individually wealthy without
  adding to the general wealth, may exert an influence out of all proportion
  to their numbers. A special interest of this kind is, to the general interests
  of society, as a standing army is to an unorganized mob. It gains intensity
  and energy in its specialization, and in the wealth it takes from the general
  stock finds power to mold opinion. Leisure and culture and the circumstances
  and conditions that command respect accompany wealth, and intellectual ability
  is attracted by it. On the other hand, those who suffer from the injustice
  that takes from the many to enrich the few, are in that very thing deprived
  of the leisure to think, and the opportunities, education, and graces necessary
  to give their thought acceptable expression. They are necessarily the "unlettered," the "ignorant," the "vulgar," prone
  in their consciousness of weakness to look up for leadership and guidance to
  those who have the advantages that the possession of wealth can give. &#8212; <em>The

WE may be wise to distrust our knowledge; and, unless we have tested them, to
distrust what we may call our reasonings; but never to distrust reason itself.
. . . That the powers with which the human reason must work are limited and are
subject to faults and failures, our reason itself teaches us as soon as it begins
to examine what we find around us and to endeavor to look in upon our own consciousness.
But human reason is the only reason that men can have, and to assume that in
so far as it can see clearly it does not see truly, is in the man who does it
not only to assume the possession of a superior to human reason, but it is to
deny the validity of all thought and to reduce the mental world to chaos. &#8212; <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe305.html">The

SOCIAL reform is not to be secured by noise and shouting; by complaints and denunciation;
by the formation of parties, or the making of revolutions; but by the awakening
of thought and the progress of ideas. Until there be correct thought, there cannot
be right action; and when there is correct thought, right action will follow.
Power is always in the hands of the masses of men. What oppresses the masses
is their own ignorance, their own short-sighted selfishness. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp22.html">Social

  <p>BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable us to say
    with something like scientific precision that this man is rich and that man
    is poor; some line of possession which will enable us truly to distinguish
    between rich and poor in all places and conditions of society; a line of
    the natural mean or normal possession, below which in varying degrees is
    poverty, and above which in varying degrees is wealthiness? It seems to me
    that there must be. And if we stop to think of it, we may see that there
    is. If we set aside for the moment the narrower economic meaning of service,
    by which direct service is conveniently distinguished from the indirect service
    embodied in wealth, we may resolve all the things which directly or indirectly
    satisfy human desire into one term service, just as we resolve fractions
    into a common denominator. Now is there not a natural or normal line of the
    possession or enjoyment of service? Clearly there is. It is that of equality
    between giving and receiving. This is the equilibrium which Confucius expressed
    in the golden word of his teaching that in English we translate into "reciprocity."&nbsp; Naturally
    the services which a member of a human society is entitled to receive from
    other members are the equivalents of those he renders to others. Here is
    the normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what we call poverty
    take their start. He who can command more service than he need render, is
    rich. He is poor, who can command less service than he does render or is
    willing to render: for in our civilization of today we must take note of
    the monstrous fact that men willing to work cannot always find opportunity
    to work. The one has more than he ought to have; the other has less. Rich
    and poor are thus correlatives of each other; the existence of a class of
    rich involves the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse; and abnormal
    luxury on the one side and abnormal want on the other have a relation of
    necessary sequence. To put this relation into terms of morals, the rich are
    the robbers, since they are at least sharers in the proceeds of robbery;
    and the poor are the robbed. This is the reason, I take it, why Christ, Who
    was not really a man of such reckless speech as some Christians deem Him
    to have been, always expressed sympathy with the poor and repugnance of the
    rich. In His philosophy it was better even to be robbed than to rob. In the
    kingdom of right doing which He preached, rich and poor would be impossible,
    because rich and poor in the true sense are the results of wrong-doing. And
    when He said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
    than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven," He simply put in the
    emphatic form of Eastern metaphor a statement of fact as coldly true as the
    statement that two parallel lines can never meet. <strong>Injustice cannot
    live where justice rules, and even if the man himself might get through,
    his riches &#8212; his
    power of compelling service without rendering service &#8212; must of necessity
    be left behind. If there can be no poor in the kingdom of heaven, clearly
    there can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible in this, or in any
    other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty, without at the same time
    abolishing unjust possessions. </strong>This is a hard word to the softly amiable
    philanthropists, who, to speak metaphorically, would like to get on the good
    side of God without angering the devil. But it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; <em>The

            </a>THE common law we are told is the perfection of reason, and certainly
            the landowners cannot complain of its decision, for it has been built

            rightfully belong to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>another?
            Nothing at all. That he purchased in good faith gives him no right
            or claim whatever. The law does not concern itself with the "intricate
            question of compensation" to the innocent purchaser. The law does
            not say, as John Stuart Mill says: "The land belongs to A, therefore

            the rent, or compensation for its salable value." For that would
            be indeed like a famous fugitive slave case decision in which the
            Court was said to have given the law to the North and the nigger
            to the South. The law simply says: "The land belongs to A, let the

            <br>
COMPENSATED for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
of land-owners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
We are willing that bygones should be bygones, and to leave dead wrongs to bury
their dead. We propose to let those who, by the past appropriation of land-value,
have taken the fruits of labor, retain what they have thus got. We merely propose
that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease. &#8212; NOW, is the State
called on to compensate men for the failure of their expectations as to its action,
even where no moral element is involved? If it make peace, must it compensate
those who have invested on the expectation of war. If it open a shorter highway,
is it morally bound to compensate those who may lose by the diversion of travel
from the old one? If it promote the discovery of a cheap means of producing electricity
directly from heat, is it morally bound to compensate the owners of all the steam
engines thereby thrown out of use and all who are engaged in making them? If
it develop the air-ship, must it compensate those whose business would be injured?
Such a contention would be absurd. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
Condition of Labor</a><br>
          <br>
Yet the contention we are considering is worse. It is that the State must compensate
for disappointing the expectations of those who have counted on its continuing
to do wrong. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A Perplexed

            <br>
COMPENSATION implies equivalence. To compensate for the discontinuance of a wrong
is to give those who profit by the wrong the pecuniary equivalent of its continuance.
Now the State has nothing that does not belong to the individuals who compose
it. What it gives to some it must take from others. Abolition with compensation
is therefore not really abolition, but continuance under a different form &#8212; on

  <p>"CAVEAT emptor" is the maxim of the law &#8212; "Let the buyer beware!" If
    a man buys a structure in which the law of gravity is disregarded or mechanical
    laws ignored, he takes the risk of those laws asserting their sway. And so
    he takes the risk in buying property which contravenes the moral law. When
    he ignores the moral sense, when he gambles on the continuance of a wrong,
    and when at last the general conscience rises to the point of refusing to
    continue that wrong, can he then claim that those who have refrained from
    taking part in it, those who have suffered from it, those who have borne
    the burden and heat and contumely of first moving against it, shall share
    in his losses on the ground that as members of the same state they are equally
    responsible for it? And must not the acceptance of this impudent plea tend
    to prevent that gradual weakening and dying out of the wrong, which would
    otherwise occur as the rise of the moral sense against it lessened the prospect
    of its continuance; and by promise of insurance to investors tend to maintain
    it in strength and energy till the last minute? &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

ALL pleas for compensation on the abolition of unequal rights to land are excuses
for avoiding right and continuing wrong; they all, as fully as the original wrong,
deny that equalness which is the essential of justice. Where they have seemed
plausible to any honestly-minded man, he will, if he really examines his thought,
see that this has been so because he has, though perhaps unconsciously, entertained
a sympathy for those who seem to profit by injustice which he has refused to
those who have been injured by it. He has been thinking of the few whose incomes
would be cut off by the restoration of equal right. He has forgotten the many,
who are being impoverished, degraded, and driven out of life by its denial. If
he once breaks through the tyranny of accustomed ideas and truly realizes that
all men are equally entitled to the use of the natural opportunities for the
living of their lives and the development of their powers, he will see the injustice,
the wickedness, of demanding compensation for the abolition of the monopoly of
land. He will see that if anyone is to be compensated on the abolition of a wrong,
it is those who have suffered by the wrong, not those who have profited by it. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We recognize that the
implementation of our ideas will lead to the
disappearance of the sale value of titles to unimproved land and
other forms of privilege. While some will see this as an unjust
confiscation of property, we deny this.
<br>
<br>
We believe that it is possible to implement our ideas while
remaining true to <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">principles of
justice</a>. We note first that, while we
propose to introduce or increase fees for exclusive access to
opportunities assigned by governments, we also propose to eliminate
existing taxes.
<br>
For many people the value of eliminating existing taxes will
offset the fall in the market value of the privileges they now claim.
But it cannot be expected that all persons experience full offsets.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There will be some persons whose
income prospects fall as a
consequence of the implementation of our ideas. But this in itself
does not constitute injustice. Every change disappoints someone.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is our view that what makes a
disappointing change an injustice
is not the fact of disappointment, but rather a self-seeking
disregard for adverse consequences to those whose prospects fall.</span>
Such selfish disregard for others must be distinguished from the
implementation of new moral insights. Of course, one can always try
to hide self-seeking proposals behind a facade of alleged
principle.<br>
<br>
Thus the necessary distinctions are difficult to make, but this
does not justify abandoning the effort to make them. ...&nbsp; <a

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens?
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed? <strong>...</strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair? <strong>... 
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If
people cannot be
expected to pay for educating the children that they ought to be able
to have, doesn't that mean that there is some fundamental unfairness
in the starting conditions? Is it not the combination of past
injustice and current unequal access to natural opportunities that
makes us reluctant to require people to pay the full costs of having
children?</span> In my conception of justice, we have not adequately
compensated for past injustice until we have put people in a position
where we are content to oblige them to pay the full costs of their
choices. ... </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A favorite excuse of royal
libertarians is that the land has been
divided up for so long that tracing the rightful owners would be
pointless. But there can be no rightful owners if we all have an
inalienable right of access to the earth. It is not some ancient
injustice we seek to rectify, but an ongoing injustice. The piece of
paper granting title might be ancient, but the tribute levied on the
landless goes on and on.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One might as well have accepted
monarchy under the excuse that
whatever conquest led to monarchy occurred centuries ago, and that
tracing the rightful monarchs would be pointless. Indeed, landed
aristocracy is the last remnant of monarchy. ... <a
