      The electromagnetic spectrum is a finite bit of the natural creation.&nbsp; In
      some parts of the country, there isn't enough population density to draw
      enough broadcasters to fill&nbsp;all the slots on the AM or FM ranges.&nbsp; But
      in others, particularly in the largest cities, the right to use a particular
      bit
      of spectrum sells for hundreds of millions of dollars. Would you be surprised
      to learn that the New York metro area has not even a single country music
      radio station? </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>From time to time we hear it said that the airwaves belong to the American
      people.&nbsp; But the evidence is strong that they do not: they are sold
      from one corporation to another, at high prices, and the American people
      receive
      nothing; only the shareholders (and perhaps the most highly paid managers)
      benefit. This is a very peculiar kind of privilege.</p>
  <p>A better way would be for the commons to own the spectrum, and lease each
    segment out on a five year lease, with each slot up for bids.&nbsp; Who
    would benefit?&nbsp; The commons &#8212; and all of us &#8212; because it
    would provide a fine source of revenue and make real the statement that the
    airwaves
    belong
    to us.&nbsp; Who
    would lose?&nbsp; Corporations, their highest-paid managers and their shareholders,
    who have succeeded in privatizing this common asset, and get to collect the
    advertising
    revenue
    without
    passing a share of it to the commons.</p>
  <p>Think of the impact on campaign finance reform: a large part of
    what candidates must pay for is access to the airwaves.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: In <em>Globalization and its Discontents</em>, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ...</p>
  <p>Q: I wanted to ask your view on the adequacy of land as a tax base. At one
    time, as you know, there was a &quot;Single Tax&quot; movement, for the purpose
    of deriving revenues sufficient to run the government solely from land value
    taxation. In your view, how feasible is that today?</p>
  <p>JES: Most economists would say that you cannot run the US economy on the &quot;Single
    Tax.&quot; In my mind, the &quot;Single Tax&quot; is the wrong way to think
    about it. The question is: &quot;Would it be better if we had more taxation
    of land and natural resource, and more revenue from natural resource management,
    and I would include atmosphere and spectrum.&quot; And less tax on income
    and savings. And I would say, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I think many economists
    would agree with that. So, if you want to sell it as a &quot;Single Tax,&quot; then,
    no, you won't get anyone to agree that there's enough revenue there. If you
    look at is a more &quot;central&quot; tax, then, yes, you will get most economists
    to agree with you. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>The Possibility of Land (Rent) Taxation</strong></p>
  <p>The key to understanding how taxing various forms of land conform to sound
    tax theory comes with an appreciation of the importance of economic rent.
    Largely discarded in 20th century economic analysis, rent is the price for
    the use of land. Just as the price of labor is paid in wages and the price
    of capital is paid in interest, land rent is the unearned increment that
    attaches to land in the form of a surplus when its price is not paid by its
    users. All taxes, ultimately, come out of rent; however, by collecting revenue
    from other sources, the rent is left to settle in ever increasing encrustations
    on land sites, i.e., capitalized, ultimately raising their market price.
    In so doing, these land prices are distorted so that their optimal use is
    not secured.</p>
  <p>Examples of such distortion are not difficult to identify. Consider, first
    of all, the use of locations in our urban environments, many of which are
    underused while prospective entrepreneurs are driven to second-best locations
    because titleholders opt to let the rent accrete and passively raise their
    market price. Land speculation is rife most of all in instances where there
    is a great disparity between the tax rate on these sites and the rate of
    rent appreciation. When the holding costs of ownership are nominal, there
    is no incentive for improving them or selling to others who will, and urban
    environments suffer as a result. <strong>Another example is rent that collects
    to the electromagnetic spectrum, making it attractive for owners of electronic
    media, communications networks and so on, to rely on returns to their investments
    even when the resource itself is sparsely used. </strong>So also with the
    time slots for take-offs and landings at airports. These opportunities are
    respected
    as private property, even while they gain in market value in response to
    the general traffic volume of the facility. This occurs regardless whether
    the particular airlines use their slots or not. London Mayor Ken Livingstone
    has proposed to tax the rent from Heathrow and Gatwick both for their revenue
    advantage and to assure their more optimal use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7]</em></strong></font> One
    could go on, pointing to any number of instances where economic rent is available
    to be had for the support of public services in lieu of conventional taxes
    which we recognize as destructive in their effects.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font> It
    is not surprising that when pressed even conventional (neoclassical) economists
    are often willing to concede that the best possible tax of all is one placed
    on land rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9] ...</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>It should also be noted that a transition to a tax on land rent would not
    be not difficult. In lieu of the conventional real property tax, it is already
    widely used,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[12]</em></strong></font> and many
    localities are presently phasing in such a shift, downtaxing improvements
    and uptaxing land.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> As
    for taxes at other levels of government, it is already conceded, for example,
    that &quot;The Public Owns the Airwaves,&quot; a statement that is belied
    by the fact that the media and communications industry treats its rights
    to the use of frequency licenses as private property and whose market value
    is typically reflected when such corporations are sold.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> One
    should also note as another example the case of the Alaska Permanent Fund,
    which provides a reliable citizen's dividend every year to everyone in that
    state, derived from oil revenue.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15] </em></strong></font>Development
    Administrator Paul Bremer proposed such a design for the new government of
    Iraq in 2003, a design idea that was also endorsed by the United Nations
    Association.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> Many other
    instances could be cited where already land rent is recovered as a surplus
    to support public services. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both on grounds of justice and

system of allocating rights to use the radio frequency spectrum, with
public collection of the value of rights granted, is best. The right to
use the frequency spectrum is a scarce resource, whose value is derived
primarily from the mere existence of the spectrum and not from the
efforts of those who might be granted use. Thus the whole population
has equal respectable claims to use. But efficient use of the resource
requires exclusive assignment of frequencies within particular
geographical areas. Therefore justice is served by requiring those who

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive use of radio
frequencies</span> and taxes on activities with harmful consequences</span>,
such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes have long been
supported by Geonomists. Full resource
rentals imposed on such things as timber extraction or commercial
fishing prevent undervaluation, wastage and overexploitation. "Polluter

being charges for use and abuse of air, water and other natural

<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">electromagnetic spectrum</span>
also falls within the wide definition of land. To sell it off for good
to the highest cash bidder is to set up an exploitative and

who increase its value as much as they increase that of land.
Government should act as its custodian, auctioning off for rent the
various segments of the bandwidth. To prevent changing economic
circumstances or technological developments from dropping big chunks of
economic rent into the laps of bandwidth lessees, rents should be
regularly and appropriately reviewed and raised. That Kerry Packer's
broadcasting licences have appreciated by well over a billion dollars
shows the foolishness of failing to distinguish, for tax purposes,
between land and capital. And perhaps shows the political influence of

 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The initial distribution of land
- the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land. What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> radio spectrum,
signal relay sites,</span> landing rights, beach access, oil and gas,
space on
telephone and power poles(e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, <span style="font-weight: bold;">radio,</span>
landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money. Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.&nbsp;<big> </big></small><small><a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, for pricing to work at
all, there must be both supply and
demand; the lack of either results in there being no market price at
all. Is it possible, perhaps, that policies might be developed where
demand for certain resources are reduced to zero &#8212; and hence no price?
To some extent this is how the Georgist economics approach works. It
leaves certain realms of the commons unthreatened by exploitation for
the reason that the attention of the market is focused elsewhere. By
the collection of economic rent the prices of resources are effectively
shifted, so much so that the market arena is profoundly altered.
Resource prices are shifted in such a way that their use is curtailed
and their consumption concentrated. It was noted earlier, for example,
that collection of land rent tends to reverse the centrifugal forces of
sprawl, actualizing demand at the core of urban areas and leaving
remote regions uninhabited and
intact. Economic rent accrues to sites that have high demand and
frequent use; collecting that economic rent tends to concentrate their
use in ways that discourages speculative practices, allocate their use
to those who can best maximize their utility, and leave other sites and
commodities in remote areas less affected by human activity. So also
with charges for other public resources such as radio frequencies and
airport landing slots. Pricing incentives are established in such a way
that economic activity is intensified, concentrated, and integrated
without the need of artificial CAC instruments such as zoning, urban
growth boundaries, community land trusts, and other devices which are
expensive to implement and have notable records of failure.</small><br>
<br>
<small>On the other hand, collection of economic rent, whether it be
from the
use of land sites, fossil fuels, fishing grounds, solar and wind energy
settings, electromagnetic spectrum frequencies, airport landing
timeslots, and or even air sinks facilitates their highest and best use
while leaving less attractive settings unaffected. Where there exists
the possibility that environmentally sensitive sites or resources might
otherwise be exploited, then is the appropriate time to institute
focused CAC approaches, and with more attentive and efficient
administration for all involved. The practice of concentrating economic
activity in the more limited footprint that pricing creates is
consistent with approaches taken in ecological economics. This is
because the economy is recognized as only one component of human
experience and the world system, not coterminous with it. Daly, for
instance, draws concentric circles to illustrate the proper setting of
the economic system &#8212; inside the social and cultural system which
itself exists in a greater ecosystem. Collection of economic rent has a
centrifugal and concentrating effect on human activity and hence upon
the ecosystem itself. It has a benign effect on ecosystems insofar as
it effectuates a steep and identifiable market gradient between areas
of heavy socio-economic activity and those that bring no price at all.
And yet by facilitating closer contact between members of the human
community, it also fosters exchanges of a nature
that are outside the market economy &#8212; family relationships and
neighborhood activity.... <a

  for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Extensions
    to Other State-Allocated Privileges</b></p>
    <p>The central idea of the systems developed here is that the price to be charged
      to someone who makes continuing use of a state-supplied privilege can be
      determined by annual offers for corresponding privileges. The idea can be
      applied not only to land but to other domains as well. One domain that comes
      readily to mind is use of the frequency spectrum. As with land, effective
      use of the frequency spectrum (by radio stations, television stations, cellular
      telephone networks and so on) requires a social understanding that a particular
      individual or organization is permitted to have exclusive use of particular
      parts of what is available. (In the case of the frequency spectrum, this
      means the exclusive right to broadcast in a given frequency band in a given
      geographical area.)</p>
    <p>People who wish to use frequency allocations generally need to be assured
    that they will have continuing use of the portions of the frequency spectrum
    that are assigned to them, so that they will not be left with useless broadcasting
    and receiving equipment. If so few people ever want to use the frequency
    spectrum that there is never a shortage of band widths to be allocated, then
    it is perfectly just and efficient simply to permit anyone who wishes to
    use the frequency spectrum to state the band width he or she wishes to use
    and then to require others not to interfere. However, if band-width allocations
    are scarce, then justice requires that those who receive allocations compensate
    the rest of society for their privileged status. But how much should they
    pay?</p>
    <p>The systems described in this paper can be applied to determine appropriate
    payments. If one wishes to use a system involving actual transfer of broadcasting
    rights, then payments can be determined by occasional (secondprice) auctions
    of the right to use a given band width for a single year. If one wishes to
    have the greater information that is available with bids for options, then
    one asks potential users of the frequency spectrum to make binding offers
    annually on a large number of contiguous band-widths, rewards the highest
    bidders and uses the highest bids to determine the payments required of continuing
    users of the frequency spectrum. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read

      as they had before, the media companies got their free airwaves anyway.</p>
    <p>If an accounting could be made, private appropriations of the commons
      in America alone would be worth trillions of dollars. The plot is almost
      always the same: when a commons acquires commercial value, someone tries
      to grab it. In the old days, that meant politically connected individuals;
      nowadays, it means politically powerful corporations. What&#8217;s astonishing
      about these takings isn&#8217;t that they occur, but how unaware of them
      the average citizen is. As former Secretary of the Interior Walter Hickel
      said, &#8220;If you steal $10 from a man&#8217;s wallet, you&#8217;re likely
      to get into a fight, but if you steal billions from the commons, co-owned
      by him and his descendants, he may not even notice.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      $458 million &#8212; the return on their investment was 5,725 percent.

      percent. For a paltry $5 million in campaign contributions, the broadcasting
      industry was able to secure free digital TV licenses, a giveaway of public
      property worth $70 billion &#8212; that&#8217;s an incredible 1,400,000

  <blockquote>
    <p>At present, there are no such controls. Though the airwaves belong to
      the people, no public agency limits TV advertising time. Until 1982, the
      major networks adhered to a voluntary code limiting ads to 9.5 minutes
      per hour in prime time. Then, profit maximizing took over, and the networks
      dropped their code. Today, a typical &#8220;one-hour&#8221; prime-time
      show has about forty-two minutes of content and eighteen minutes of ads
      and promotions, nearly twice the advertising intensity of two decades ago.
      ...</p>
    <p>The airwaves, also known as the broadcast spectrum, are a gift of nature
      that modern technology has turned into a valuable resource. As a medium
      for sharing information and ideas, airwaves have enormous advantages over
      paper and wires. The problem in the early days was that signals often interfered
      with one another. If two nearby transmitters used the same or adjacent
      frequencies, a radio listener would hear two sound streams simultaneously.
      America&#8217;s approach to this problem (though not Britain&#8217;s or
      Canada&#8217;s) was to give free exclusive local frequencies to private
      broadcasters, subject to periodic hearings and renewal.</p>
    <p>The quid pro quo for this gift, according to the Communications Act of
      1934, was that broadcasters would serve &#8220;the public interest, convenience,
      and necessity&#8221; &#8212; whatever that might mean. The airwaves themselves
      would remain, in theory, public property, with the Federal Communications
      Commission (again in theory) acting as trustee.</p>
    <p>Private broadcasters grew large and profitable under this arrangement.
      But over time, as their advertising revenues soared, their public-interest
      obligations declined. In the 1980s, the FCC dropped the Fairness Doctrine,
      which required broadcasters to air both sides of controversial issues.
      Educational programming also waned. In the 1990s the spread of cell phones
      created huge new demand for airwaves. Instead of giving frequencies to
      cell phone companies for free, Congress wisely chose to auction them, raising
      billions of dollars for the federal treasury. Broadcasters, however, lobbied
      hard for more free spectrum, and in 1996 Congress gave it to them, ostensibly
      for digital TV. This was the $70 billion giveaway I described earlier.
      Today, digital technology makes it possible for &#8220;smart&#8221; receivers
      to pick out only the signals they need. Signal interference thus is, or
      soon could be, a thing of the past &#8212; which makes exclusive licenses
      unnecessary. The airwaves could be an open access commons with virtually
      no capacity limits, a possibility that makes broadcasters, phone, and cable
      companies extremely anxious.</p>
    <p>Some broadcasters have another idea. They want to privatize the airwaves,
      with ownership assigned to them. Under this plan, the free licenses they
      received for digital TV would become permanent entitlements usable for
      any purpose. Broadcasters could then sell their entitlements to cell phone
      companies and pocket the windfall. The big winners would be General Electric
      (NBC), Disney (ABC), and Rupert Murdoch (Fox). Other beneficiaries would
      include Pat Robertson (Christian Broadcasting Network) and Lowell &#8220;Bud&#8221; Paxson
      (Pax TV). When a reporter asked Paxson why he should receive millions of
      dollars for selling the public&#8217;s airwaves, he replied: &#8220;I was
      a farmer and I got lucky. Now people want to build a mall on my farm. God
      bless America.&#8221;</p>
    <p>If Congress treated the airwaves as a common asset, it would lease most
      of them at market rates for limited terms to the highest bidders. The billions
      of dollars thus raised could buy free airtime for political candidates,
      fund noncommercial radio and TV, and help sustain the arts.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, Congress could turn the airwaves into an open access commons
      like roads and streets. Using technologies like wi-fi (wireless fidelity),
      everyone could enjoy high-speed Internet access for almost nothing. As
      of early 2006, nearly 150 U.S. cities were deploying or planning public
      wi-fi networks. These efforts are hampered by the fact that the frequencies
      allotted to wi-fi don&#8217;t travel as far, or penetrate buildings as
      well, as do the frequencies given to broadcasters. A bill to open unused
      TV channels for wi-fi has been introduced by a group of senators, but it
      faces stiff opposition from broadcasters, telephone, and cable companies. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
      of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
    <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
    <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
    <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
    and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
    Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
    <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
    <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
    <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
    <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>
