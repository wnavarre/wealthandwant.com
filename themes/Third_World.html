<small>As important as our ideas are for the justice and efficiency of
the American economy, their application is even more important in
less developed countries, where often 80% of the land is held by 3%
of the population. To give all the citizens of these countries
chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which
inevitably winds up putting land into the hands of people who cannot
use it well) but by requiring any one who uses land to pay according
to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring
this message to the world, we must first apply it to ourselves.

and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s all about treating the land as an &#8220;asset.&#8221;</p>
  <p>In &quot;developing countries&quot; it leads to a terrible vicious circle:
    peasants lose their land to one of two groups: either, first, to land-baron
    cronies of corrupt regimes &#8212; who hold land idle for the specific reason
    of not allowing peasants to use it, thus making sure they have no place to
    go, and are willing to work for subsistence wages &#8212; or, second, to
    multinational corporations, who run huge plantations to grow crops for export.
    The foreign
    exchange thus gained goes for debt service, which allows the ruling regime
    to keep playing by the IMF's rules, and stay in power. Meanwhile, the peasants
    gravitate to the cities, seeking nonexistent jobs, and end up in shantytowns
    that lack clean water and sewers.</p>
  <p> We're told that two billion people live on less than two dollars a day.
    Now, certainly there is lots of poverty in the world &#8212; but that statistic
      troubles me. Two dollars a day? Consider your own basic needs, and ask
    yourself how far two bucks will go toward satisfying them. Nobody can survive
    on two
      dollars a day. Why haven't those two billion people just keeled over by
    now? </p>
  <p>This sort of paradox led the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen to
    the studies described in his book <em>Development as Freedom</em>. Sen contends
    that the true measure of economic welfare &#8212; and therefore of development
    in any meaningful sense &#8212; can't be a matter of GDP and other conventional
    measures of &quot;growth.&quot; Any true measure of economic welfare must
    have to do with the degree to which each person can set and achieve his or
    her own
    economic goals. </p>
  <p> Economic freedom for the world&#8217;s poorest people is unquestionably all
      about the land. Let's say a peasant family has a goat and a garden, and, working
      carefully, can grow enough to feed itself. Occasionally a good harvest will
      yield some surplus which can be sold &#8212; there wouldn't be much of that,
      but let's say it brought in an average of two dollars a day. With thrift,
    enough for school clothes, maybe even books. </p>
  <p>Now, let's imagine that the family lost their land &#8212; perhaps an injury
      or some other disaster made it impossible to keep farming it &#8212; and they
      had to go to the city, where they managed to find a combination of odd jobs,
      yielding them an income of $10 per day. Now, they had to somehow buy their
      food and every other necessity out of that ten dollars, and they had to live
      in a miserable shack, with open sewage running in unpaved streets &#8212; yet
    in terms of development numbers, their income had increased by $500%.</p>
  <p> In which case did the family have more freedom? Which scenario is more conducive
    to development?</p>
  <p>We were talking about the tendency for landowners to use land as an investment &#8212; a
      sensible thing to do &#8212; not to use it now if they don't need to, but to
      think in terms of enjoying its increase in value over time. We even identified
      that as the key to the problem of poverty. But &#8212; good heavens, what
      can we do about that? Isn't that just how the economy works? Isn't the private
      ownership of land a basic part of a modern economy? How can we do without
      such
    an important institution?</p>
  <p> Or in other words &#8212; won't the poor always be with us?</p>
  <p> Not necessarily. It has been plain, since very earliest days of civil society,
      that the private ownership of land leads to exploitation and great extremes
      of wealth and poverty. And, since the time of the Book of Leviticus, we have
      had a pretty good idea of what to do about it. In that book were recorded
      the words &quot;The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is Mine, for
      ye are strangers and sojourners with me.&quot; ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">Summary<br>
</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Common Property in Land is
Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small> Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the radio
spectrum. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications.</span> Radio spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
lease it for a limited time, so
you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
</small></div>
<small>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydrocarbons
are a third set of valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
nations, including some of your
neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
revenues. Norway pays for a
lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
so valuable that the mere
change in their appraised value in several recent years
has exceeded the entire
GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
production, they may
be the largest in the world.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
there is another side to this.
The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
oil in Russian terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective
way to tax resource
rents.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska
holds down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.
</span>Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri Lvov from the
Russian Academy of
Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
could cover most of
your national budget from your enormous production of oil
and gas.
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
</small></div>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other
subsoil resources have great value, too.</span> Many
nations, even backward
ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from
"hardrock" minerals. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bolivia,
Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
Zaire, and Zambia
have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
years; Chile, Thailand
and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.</span>
Saskatchewan, a
Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
uranium; Minnesota, an
American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
nations fail to raise much
revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
like S. Africa with its gold
and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
with its lead mines and
reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life,
and the most valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For
example, in southern California we need water so much we
import it from the
Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
through the long San Joaquin
Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
tunnel it through the
San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
gets here, it
supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the
Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal
to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local
waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus
value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually
subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
that is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
time we learned to husband
and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
surplus. So should you, in
comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;</small></div>
<small>&nbsp;
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another
value from water is to generate power.</span> Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.
British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
Quebec, and other provinces
raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
water. Russia, with some of
the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
same, or better.
</small><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
value.</span> In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</small>...<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid letting lessees of public
land conceal
their revenues</span>. Many
minerals and hydrocarbons on public lands are leased
by private firms,
subject either to "royalties" or "severance taxes"
based on the value of
output. Many of these private firms are "vertically
integrated," meaning they
own the downstream firms, often in other countries,
to which they sell.
They grow skilled at shifting profits away from where
taxes are higher to
where they are lower, by rigging the internal
transfer prices. That is, they
sell to themselves at artificially low prices, so
your share of their revenues
disappears. What they call "world market" prices are
really their own
internal prices, adjusted to help them steal from
you. You must guard
against that.

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid trying to distribute
rents to consumers by
capping prices
below the market.</span> This, of course, is the history of
energy prices in
Russia; it has also been used, in milder forms, in
Canada and the U.S.
What is wrong with it? In a word, it fosters wasteful
use, and aborts a lot of
economical production. In addition, it leaves a lot
of rent in private hands,
untaxed.

<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
It is easy to understand the dire need for guaranteed fuel
in a northern continental
winter climate. You mustn't let people freeze, and they
will bless and support you
for keeping them warm. As society gets better organized,
though, you can gain by
guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
buy fuel and other
needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
free fuel that you might be
exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the
cash income from the
rents created when fuel prices rise, and have a lot more
to spare from the resulting
net gains, which I next explain.</span> ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Note, finally, that a cap on the price of G [gross revenues],
such as discussed above, has the same effects as a tax based on
G.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a
