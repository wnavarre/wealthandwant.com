  <p><br>
    The revenue that collecting land rent would generate is not the only or
    even the primary goal of George's reform!&nbsp; Harry Pollard, head of the
    Henry George School of Social Sciences in Los Angeles, put it this way: <em>&quot;It
    is better to collect Rent and throw it in the
    ocean than not collect it
  at all.&quot;</em> He goes on to say, &quot;This because the economic effects of collecting
  Rent
  are
  incomparably
  more important than any revenue collected.&quot;</p>

  <div align="left">
    <p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
      have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought about
      under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth. It
      is the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes
      a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth. Let
      us work by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against it,
      it is hard pulling and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take some
rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.*</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar
          with economic terminology may assume, the whole amount paid for the
          use of real estate. It is only that part of such amount which is paid
          for the use of the bare land or site employed, exclusive of the payment
          for the use of any buildings or other improvements on it. H. G. B.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
      need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount
      of land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes,
      land, no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held,
      would be really common property, and every member of the community would
      participate in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
    <p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily
      be increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition
      into practical form by proposing --</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land
          values.</em></strong></p>
    <p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
      but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of
      the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country, even
      the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear
      the entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries it
      is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place
      all taxes upon the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds
      the present governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount
      demanded in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses
      and rent advances. But this is so natural and easy a matter, that it may
      be considered as involved, or at least understood, in the proposition to
      put all taxes on the value of land. That is the first step upon which the
      practical struggle must be made. When the hare is once caught and killed,
      cooking him will follow as a matter of course. When the common right to
      land is so far appreciated that all taxes are abolished save those which
      fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more than is necessary to induce
      them to collect the public revenues being left to individual landholders.</p>
    <p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds
      lodgment sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but
      there are few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first,
      or even for a long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is a
        real antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over
        the idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly to
        tax them.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
        capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
        poorer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
      there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature,
      education, and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong
      which in every civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty
      and want, will not die without a bitter struggle. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/07_Simplicity_Introducing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
    and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>We propose
to take that for the benefit of the whole community instead of
allowing it to go, as it does now, into the pockets of individuals.
Is not that, a change that ought to amount to something? (Hear;
hear.) But that mere transference is but a little of the good that
will result. What we aim at is not so much the taking of rent for the
use of the community as freeing the land for the use of labour. </small><br>

<small>With
taxes on land values, with taxes on economic rent from land, whether
it was vacant land or the site of a factory, or pleasure ground or
farm, would compel all over this country the &#8220;dogs in the
manger&#8221; to let go their grasp. (Hear, hear and cheers.) It would
give opportunities by which labour could employ itself.&nbsp; ... <a
