    People want to live there, and they also want to live in modern homes which
    meet current-day ideas about the number and sizes of rooms and layout, not
    to mention using current technology and new systems. Should their only choice

  <p>If you've played the board game Monopoly, you know that some neighborhoods,

    the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Land Fraction of
Real Estate Value (LFREV) is much higher than standard modern sources
show:&nbsp;</span> On most assessment rolls the value of
old &#8220;junker&#8221; buildings, on the eve of demolition, is listed as higher
than the land under them. This betrays the erroneous use of the
&#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of separating land from building values. It
should be obvious that the old junker has no residual value: that is
why it is being junked. Junking is continuous in enclaves of high value
like Kenilworth, Illinois, or Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Locational obsolescence</span>&#8221; is the key
concept. The high and growing value of the underlying site cannibalizes
the residual building value.&nbsp; <a

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The question
I am assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.<strong> ... </strong><b></b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have here data (Gaffney, 1970,
submitted herewith) I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%. &nbsp;</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling
a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you buy an old
junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan.</span>
When the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most of the lots
are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State
Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location?<strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Hold on once more," I hear,
"not so fast, <b>how about the
mansions of rich people?</b>" Another fair question: how, indeed, can
you justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish
you. Here are some data from British Columbia that speak to the
point. They are from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland")
and the southern part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where
over half the people in the province live. B.C. practices high
quality professional assessment; data from its rolls are quite
reliable, as such things go.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Cities and districts around
Vancouver and Victoria are
ranked, in<a
 href="../../by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#TABLE%201:%20%20Land%20Values%20%28LV%29%20per">
Table 1</a>,
according to the land value per property (single-family residences).
These range from nearly $700,000 each in the "University Endowment
Lands" district (very posh), to around $40,000 each in the "Victoria
Rural" district (more modest). The last column, LSREV (Land Share of
Real Estate Value), shows the land value (L) as a share of the total
value (B+L). <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...
The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;The average house (ex
land) in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth 2.8 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9). The average land parcel (ex building) in the UEL is
worth 17.5 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. Seldom will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;What do those data tell us?
The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable. The rich put a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive.&nbsp; ... 
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That's the bad news. How do you
turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Once it begins, it proceeds
incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;I once wrote a long chapter
on this subject, "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">T</span><b><i>he
Adequacy of Land as a Tax Base</i></b>" (Gaffney, 1970). It came out
of two years of research, and is too long even to summarize now. I am
delivering it to Pat Salkin, however, and hope she may add it to the
record of this conference. I also attach a short bibliography of
articles that expand on topics covered above, for whoever is moved to
study more on this fascinating subject. I hope you think it as
important as I do. Please pick up this ball and run with it.
Nobody said it was going to be easy. There are some bone-crushing
line-backers out there, like Greed, Ignorance, Myopia, and Inertia.
So much the more credit to you when you cross the line: your fans

Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">George's
Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical
resolutions and synergies<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>.<small>.. </small></b>George
was a <i>mensch</i>, like Holly
Whyte or Jane
Jacobs, seeing cities in intensely human, interactive terms. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George
saw cities as </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">foci</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> of
communication, cooperation,
socialization and exchange, and these as the basis of civilization.
He saw cities as the new frontier, an endless series of new frontiers
because the city as a whole enjoys increasing returns: the presence
of people with good mutual access, associating on equal terms,
expedites cooperation and specialization through the market.
</span>Multivariate interactions in cities are synergistic. Indeed,
while
each part -- each parcel of land -- is developed in the stage of
decreasing returns, the composite city is generally in a stage of
increasing returns, thanks to synergy: the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts, and increases to the whole yield more than the sum
of increases to the parts.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep and
stifle renewal. Whatever slows renewal of one site therefore slows
the neighborhood, which reflects back blight to the first, a vicious
downward spiral. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conversely, new buildings help
stimulate renewal around
them.<font size="-2"><small><i>12</i></small></font> The rule is that
new
buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other Defenders so other
owners have to renew, too. When they do, where better than next to
the newest, hottest building? So renewal is cumulative, just like
blight, only upwards in a benign spiral. A benign spiral is a "free
lunch," the kind that cynics say "there ain't no such thing as." These
matters are treated in the works cited above. </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>12 There are exceptions.
Some new
buildings, especially banks and corporate headquarters, sterilize a
block with blank walls. I will not defend that, but the exception is
not the rule; the abuse is not the precept. </small></font></small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a city untaxes buildings its
land prices, the new tax base,
are pushed up. Competition for sites raises the tax base -- not
buildings, now, but land prices derived from ground rents. Using the
higher base the city can improve public services, if needed, but
without taxing any building, without scaring away any generators of
fiscal surpluses. In this scenario, buildings raise the tax base
indirectly, by raising the value of land around them. So do
productive people, when their wages are not taxed away. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices are raised just by the
expectation of new buildings'
being tax free. The mere expectation will <i>immediately</i> boost
the value of land, even before the new buildings go up.</small>  </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax policy helps renew
cities, without subsidizing or
administering teardowns and "clearance" of old buildings and
neighborhoods. Georgist policy does not speed renewal by penalizing
old buildings, but by encouraging new ones. It does not subsidize
new ones, it just stops penalizing them. Teardown is never an end in
itself; it only comes when incidental to releasing land for new
buildings of greater capacity &nbsp;</small><small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is equally important to<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> use the "Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.</span>
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">the residual,
if any, is
building value.</span></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuing one lot or parcel this
way, you have information needed
for valuing neighboring and other comparable parcels. Using a map
with value contours, you can value a whole city this way with
surprising ease and speed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using
this method, I valued Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?
</span>Yes, I really said "tripled." <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">By his methods,
buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down.</span> Besides
depreciation and technological obsolescence, many buildings suffered
severe "locational obsolescence," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using the building-residual method
requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. The conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure, just as the old single-tax campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort. ... <a

milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.&nbsp; </b>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font
