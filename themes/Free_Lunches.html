  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Free lunches are like the claims for the blue
      pain-relieve pill: for those who get them, &quot;it works for me!&quot;     But
      are they really free? If they're not free, who is paying for them, and
      at what personal cost? They don't come out of thin air! They come at someone's
      expense, and that person is usually a worker, and usually a poorer person.</p>
    <p align="left">We have an incredibly concentrated &quot;distribution&quot; of income
      and of wealth in this country. A few of us receive awesomely high salaries
      and payoffs for our efforts, while others receive less than enough to meet
      their most simply defined needs. A few of us either personally or as shareholders
      in corporate entities own the most valuable pieces of land and natural
      resources. Are there people among us who are more entitled than the rest
      of us to the economic value of those pieces of land or natural resources?
      Are some of us more equal than others?</p>
    <p align="left">One of the benefits of land value taxation is that it differentiates
      between what the individual produces and what society produces, and collects
      from individual holders that which society is rightly entitled to &#8212; leaving
      the individual to keep that which he actually produces. In the process
      of collecting the common treasure, it becomes possible for the individual
      to be far more productive, and therefore have more to keep, than is the
      case under land monopoly capitalism.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><b>Turning
land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>YOU MAY THINK
the largest category of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Most capital gains are land-value gains.
The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This price appreciation is actually a "land
gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>Of course,
investing most surplus income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Most new entries into the </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.</small>&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the
free
lunch</b>
</small><br>
<small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></div>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>
</small></div>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School
economists insist that no free lunch exists.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch.</span> However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>PROPERTY IS
APPRAISED in two ways. Both start by estimating its
market value.
<b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of buildings
from this overall value, designating the remainder as the value of
land.&nbsp; ...<b> The building-residual approach</b> starts by
valuing the land, and treats the difference as representing the
building's value. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Everyone
recognized the absurdity of calculations depicting all
the corporate land in America as having a negative value in 1993.
Suppose somebody same to you and said: "I'll give you $4 billion, but
there's a catch. Along with the $4 billion in cash, you will have to
accept ownership of all the land owned by every non-financial
corporation in the United States." Most people no doubt would see
that they were being given assets much more valuable than $4 billion,
and would jump at the offer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Fed's statistic would be dismissed
as a comic exercise showing how economists tend to lapse into
otherworldly speculation. But in this case the motive is all too
worldly. Looking beneath the surface, one finds the not-so-invisible
hand of self-interest by the real estate industry and its financial
backers.</span></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>To give the Fed
economists their due, they evidently came to the
conclusion that their statistics were fatally flawed. The September
1997 balance sheet estimates made a start along new lines by
including a calculation reflecting the original (historical) cost of
buildings. This gave land a positive value. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But nationwide totals
were no longer compiled. No longer was there a line labeled "land,"
nor does the Fed publish a residual number for market value less the
historical cost (or even the replacement cost) of buildings. Instead
of making better land estimates, the Fed has dropped what had become
a political and statistical hot potato. 1994 is the last year for
which it has estimated economy-wide land and building values.</span></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This leaves in
limbo the macro-economists and business analysts
whose business is to explain the <b>finance, insurance and real
estate (FIRE)</b> sector's dominant role in the economy. According to
the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
have the lowest land values. Real estate interests argue that this is
realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
construction costs and its lower market value.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In view of real
estate's dominant role in the economy, it is
ironic that no attempt has been made to provide better statistics.
<b>My research has shown that the Fed's methodology undervalues land
by as much as $4.5 trillion.</b> As matters stood in 1994, for
instance, the Fed estimated the U.S. economy to hold some $20
trillion in real assets (excluding human capital, for which no
official statistics are published). The land's value was calculated
to be $4.4 trillion, and building values $9 trillion. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My estimates
based on historical values suggests that land rather than buildings
represents two thirds of the nation's overall real estate value -- $9
trillion, leaving building values at just half this amount.</span> <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The
commercial loft building in which I lived rose in price
from $40,000 in 1986 to $120,000 in 1980 and $4,000,000 in 2000.</b>
This sharp increase cannot be explainable by rising building costs.
<b>The building itself steadily deteriorated.</b> All that increased
was its site value. Today, of course, that property a block from the
World Trade Center has fallen back in price, just as many new buyers
had renovated their structures. The site's value changed without any
significant reference to construction costs. One must infer that it
is the site that determines the property's value.</small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In a thriving real estate market appraisers
typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
practice
is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the
anomaly occurs when real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>REAL ESTATE
LOBBIES recognize that what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>This explains
the seeming irony that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>Whether the
gains come from selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><small>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated

<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
    and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
    Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice.</p>
  <p><br>
      How did so evident a wrong become so firmly established?<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Being the high financiers of their days and generations, they managed to
    contrive taxes which could be plausibly and gradually imposed upon the landless,
    until
      within a few generations they had succeeded in shifting most of the cost
    of government on to the plebeians without giving up a foot of land or any
    considerable
      part of the income therefrom. The &quot;common people&quot; were deftly
      loaded with the heavy end of the beam, which they have been carrying ever
      since; while
      the arbitrarily created landlords and their successors, down to the present
      day, have kept their tight hold on the community's natural income.</p>
  <p>The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their tenure
      of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary have so buttressed
      it with centuries of legislation, precedents, and judicial decisions, that
      any proposition to hark back to the terms of the original bargain, whereby
      the owners of the land agreed to pay the expenses of the government, is now
      denounced as anarchy and sacrilege.</p>
  <p><br>
      Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a buyer
        acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic rent belongs
        to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it as soon as the voters
        thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and wrong of the matter, which
        are not hard to grasp when the subject is presented in its simplest form.    </p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.

<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, <strong>&#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. </strong>When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
3. Rent will become huger yet when you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is more than a simple shift
of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LRiaTFS.html">Read the

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical economics makes an
ideal of "choice." That sounds
good, and liberating, and positive. In practice, however, it has
become a new dismal science, a science of choice where most of the
choices are bad. "TANSTAAFL"
(There Ain't No Such
Thing As A Free Lunch) is the slogan and shibboleth. Whatever you
want, you must give up something good. As an overtone there is even a
hint that what one person gains he must take from another. The theory
of gains from trade has it otherwise, but that is a heritage from the
older classical economists. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, in contrast, had a

philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>, and
synthesized a plan

each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating

the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Raising
taxable rents by
untaxing capital and labor, production and exchange: the concept of
ATCOR (All Taxes Come Out of Rents)&nbsp; </span>The meaning and
relevance of ATCOR is
that when we lower other taxes, the revenue base is not lost, but
shifted to land rents and values, which can then yield more taxes. This
is most obvious with taxes on buildings. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When we exempt buildings, and
raise tax rates on the land under them, we are still taxing the same
real estate; we are just taxing it in a different way. This &#8220;different
way&#8221; actually raises the revenue capacity of real estate by a large
factor, by relieving it of the excess burden of taxing production and
capital. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is that &#8220;free lunch&#8221;
that Chicago economists wrongly preach &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such thing as.&#8221;</span></span></small><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical experience with
exempting
buildings has shown that builders offer more for land, and sellers
demand more, when the new buildings are to be untaxed. The effect on
revenue is the same as taxing prospective new buildings before they are
even built, even though the new buildings are not to be taxed at all.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net result: the revenue capacity
of
land, when it is substituted for other tax bases, is comparable to
current revenues. Owing to efficiency effects, and renewal effects, it
may well be higher. <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_StRPOL15LE.html">Read the

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To deliver a bigger pie, the
Right
touts efficiency and growth; to better distribute the pie, the Left
urges equity and jobs. Yet jobs are less for distributing, more for
producing &#8211; if that. As automation and globalisation expand the pie,
they contract the workforce. Even </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when, or especially when, people take time
off to go to war, output increases, proving we&#8217;re well over
over-capacity. </span><span

productivity does not bless us with leisure but curses us with
unemployment.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>However, even when employment is high, jobs still do a lousy job
of
distribution. They capture less than a fair return to labor while
swallowing up our free time. Full employment with a liveable wage may
mean jobs with justice for some, but not for those unable to work, and
it reduces humans to workers, not players or creators. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding jobs rather than a
fair
share of society&#8217;s surplus implies that there is no commonwealth or
that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is
a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing.</span> And
since
society, not lone owners, generates these values, that flow of funds
belongs to everyone.</small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">RENT &#8211; THE
STUFF
OF FORTUNES &#8211; ROCKS AND RULES</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>The
value of a parcel of land is initially based on the natural
endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;), created
not by an owner but by
whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
than sites in the boondocks. </span> Land values as economic values
disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
Trump.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not
guarantee
that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,
often lets public resources at &#8220;fire-sale&#8221; prices, unduly enriching
Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously
valuable licenses for TV, radio, and cell phones to GE, Disney, Time
Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting
civilization to oil) but also enrich those few who can afford to corral
them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;

Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We call ourselves the "party of
principle," and we base property
rights on the principle that everyone is entitled to the fruits of
his labor. Land, however, is not the fruit of anyone's labor, and our
system of land tenure is based not on labor, but on decrees of
privilege issued from the state, called titles. In fact, the term
"real estate" is Middle English (originally French) for "royal
state." The "title" to land is the essence of the title of nobility,
and the root of noble privilege.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the state granted land titles
to a fraction of the
population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
or "free lunch" from the actual land users.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to royal libertarians,
land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to classical liberals,
land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A right of property in
movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson ... <a
