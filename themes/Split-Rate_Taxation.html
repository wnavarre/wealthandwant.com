<div style="margin-left: 40px;">also known as<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Two-Rate.html">
two-rate taxation</a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Split-Rate taxation is a wonderful
  example of "think globally, act locally."&nbsp; Once your state has the
  enabling legislation, individual communities can begin to reduce the
  taxes on their buildings and place more of the taxes on land values. <br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-style: italic;">Caution: In Massachusetts, the
  term "split-rate" is sometimes used to
  describe a system where commercial property (land and buildings)
  carries a higher millage rate than residential property.&nbsp; This is
  something entirely different from what we are proposing, and while it
  may be popular with residential taxpayers, it has entirely different
  effects, and fails to shift the perverse incentives that retard
  community progress. </span></small></p>
  <p><em>Similarly, in some places, the term &quot;split-rate&quot; is used to refer to
    having different millage rates for real property (real estate) and personal
    property (cars, trucks, boats, computer equipment, etc).&nbsp; That definition,
    too, is not what we're talking about here: we'd not tax personal property
    at all.</em><br>

Alanna Hartzok: <a href="../docs/Hartzok_ERD_PFboECT.html">Earth
Rights Democracy: Public Finance based on Early Christian Teachings</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As a result of decades of steady
education and promulgation, there are
now 18 municipalities in Pennsylvania which have adopted a so-called
split-rate property tax which shifts taxes away from buildings and onto
land according to site value. This approach is based on the
understanding that the property tax is actually two types of taxes --
one upon building values, and the other upon land values. This
distinction is an important one, as these two types of taxes have
significantly different impacts on incentive motives and development
results. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Decreasing the tax on buildings gives property owners the
incentive to build and to maintain and improve their properties. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>As the levy on land values is increased, land speculation
and
poor land utilization, an example being slum buildings and boarded up
buildings, are discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
signal thus sent to property holders is to either improve their
properties or sell them to someone who can do so. </span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Either way, labor and capital
gain access to land to improve and
augment the building stock. The tax incentives are harnessed correctly
to encourage effort directed to the provisioning of housing and other
basic human needs.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><big><br>
</big><br>
<small>Shifting the tax burden in this way </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>discourages land hoarding and encourages good land
utilization. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It promotes a more efficient use of urban infrastructure
(such as roads and sewers), 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>decreases the pressure towards urban sprawl (as there is
significant infill development), and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>assures a broader spread of the benefits of development to
the community as a whole.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Researchers have carefully
recorded the number of building permits issued in the three year period
before and after the <span style="font-weight: bold;">split-rate</span>
was put in place. In every instance, the number of building permits
increased significantly after the implementation of this reform. As the
city improves, without the need for subsidies, the land values
gradually increase, thus providing the city with an increasing source
of revenue for public services. With this system, land values maintain
a natural correlation to the overall health of the city. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values do not peak and spike as they do under conditions which promote
land speculation and profiteering. As development stabilizes, land
values also stabilize.</span> Thus it is possible to have a
self-financing city with citizens reaping the full rewards of their
labor and creativity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The experience with this form of taxation in the 18
municipalities of
Pennsylvania point towards the possibilities of a self-renewing city.
But until we greatly reduce or eliminate the burden of federal income
and payroll taxes and the billions of dollars of wasteful and
inequitable corporate subsidies, we will only have a partial
realization of the promise. Nonetheless, there is much we can learn
from the split-rate tax cities in Pennsylvania, upon several of which
we shall now focus.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Harrisburg</span>, the capital
of
Pennsylvania, provides one of the best examples of the benefits of
shifting taxes away from labor and productive capital and onto land
according to site values.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1981 Harrisburg was listed as the second-most distressed city
in the
nation under criteria used by the federal government. A review of the
gains made in effective economic development activities since then has
produced significant results, and the sharp reversal of nearly three
decades of previous serious decline. Beginning with the implementation
of the split-rate property tax and gradually increasing the tax on land
while decreasing the tax on buildings, Harrisburg has sustained an
economic resurgence that has garnered national acclaim. It twice won
the top United States community honor as All-American City, along with
the top state recognition from the state Chamber of Business and
Industry as Outstanding Community in Pennsylvania, all because of
Harrisburg's development initiatives and progress.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As of 2001, the value of taxable real estate was over $2.2
Billion,
versus $212 Million in 1982. Over 26,000 building permits were issued
from 1982 representing over $2.65 Billion in new investment. Even
adjusted for inflation, this is more than for any period since
Harrisburg became a municipality in the year 1791, with most of this
investment undertaken since 1990. There are over 5,500 businesses on
the city tax rolls in 2001 compared to 1,908 in 1981. The number of
vacant structures, over 5,500 in 1982, have been reduced by 85% to less
than 400. The crime rate has dropped 53% and fire rate has been cut by
72%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed has written several letters to
officials
of other cities telling them that the split-rate tax has been a key to
the remarkable renewal of his city.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The citizens of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allentown</span>,
the
third largest city in Pennsylvania with a population of 105,000, voted
for the land value tax system in 1994 and it was instituted in 1996.
The difference between the land and building rates was expanded in each
of the following four years. Michael Rosenfeld, the executive director
of that city's Redevelopment Authority, says that the benefits of this
tax approach are evident. The value of both new commercial construction
and of new residential construction increased substantially after the
shift to land value taxation. Nearly three out of every four properties
in Allentown saw some sort of tax cut. Today, many of those properties
have new or better buildings on them, stabilizing the tax base to the
point where there has been no need for a tax increase in five years.
The number of building permits in Allentown has increased by 32%
compared to the three-year period before the land value tax reform.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Allentown and Bethlehem are both in eastern Pennsylvania and are
roughly comparable as to size and economy. In that Allentown adopted
this tax approach and Bethlehem did not, there was an opportunity to
compare the two. Allentown's new construction and renovation grew by
82% in dollar value in the three years after it adopted two-rate LVT as
compared to the prior three years. Its new construction and renovation
grew 54% faster than Bethlehem's new construction and renovation
despite the infusion of much federal grant money into Bethlehem (but
not into Allentown) during 1997-99.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>The small cities of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Washington
</span>and
Monessen, both in southwestern Pennsylvania, are roughly comparable as
to size and economy. Monessen has the common form of property tax which
taxes building value significantly more than land value. After
Washington adopted the split-rate tax in 1985, it saw its new
construction and renovation increase by 33% in dollar value following
this tax reform as compared to the prior three years. During the same
time period, Monessen's new construction and renovation decreased by
26%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Studies comparing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oil City</span>,
Pennsylvania, which shifted its tax base starting in January 1989, with
Franklin, a comparable neighbor municipality, found that Oil City
experienced a 58.2% increase in new construction and renovation in the
three years after it adopted a two-rate property tax as compared to the
three years before, whereas Franklin experienced a 12.2% decline during
the same time periods.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1995, <a href="../auth/Tideman.html">Professor Nicholas Tideman</a>,
the Chairman of the Economics Dept. at Virginia Tech University and his
then-graduate student, Florenz Plassman, now a professor at the
University of Binghamton, N.Y. completed a highly technical, peer
reviewed study of land value taxation in Pennsylvania. To quote from
the conclusion of their study: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The results say that for all
four
categories of construction, an increase in the effective tax
differential is associated with an increase in the average value per
permit. In the case of residential housing, a 1% increase in the
effective tax differential is associated with a 12% increase in the
average value per unit. From the perspective of economic theory, it is
not at all surprising that when taxes are taken off of buildings,
people build more valuable buildings. But it is nice to see the
numbers."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><a href="../auth/Cord.html">Dr. Steven B. Cord</a>
has done an exhaustive review of 237 studies of land value taxation
from all over the world. In every instance there was an increase in
construction and renovation after the policy was enacted, indicating
that there were previously unmet needs for housing and other living and
working space. <span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp;</span></small><span

<p>  Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What Affordable
Housing Problem?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like all creatures --
goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing
army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why do those statistics not seem
to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The
answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast to those 11- to
14-percent annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three
decades.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A close friend in
Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as
proposed here will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
subsidies. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Conclusion, I have tried to
show that <span style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values. </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">The ethical
foundations of land value taxation. </i>The
biblical Jubilee prescription -- redividing the land every half century
-- may have been feasible for a people practicing crude agriculture.
However, a modern civilization cannot reshuffle the land without
confiscating unmovable property or discouraging economic progress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
land value plan suggested here -- increasing land taxes, while
decreasing taxes on labor, production and buildings -- achieves the
same Jubilee goal without negative effects. It lets everyone share the
economic value of the land rather than the land itself, just as a
corporation, instead of carving up physical portions of itself each
year, lets shareholders enjoy portions of the profit.</span></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The
proposed change in the property tax would enable
the community to recapture community-created land values. Those who
hold land retain undisturbed possession of it so long as they pay back
their fair share of land tax to the community each year. Those with
prized sites pay most; holders of poor locations pay least.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Society
suffers a loss when speculators hold highly
productive sites out of use. A land value tax usually persuades owners
to use land or to sell it to others who wish to do so. If not, the
higher tax compensates society for the land privileges it grants. This
approach permits the elimination or major reduction of other taxes that
weigh too heavily on wages, while it contributes to increases in local
productivity.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Seven
Pennsylvania cities have independently
increased tax rates on land while imposing much lower tax rates on
buildings. Scranton, with a population of 87,000, has had a modest
two-rate tax for 70 years. When federal funding was cut in 1980, it
raised the tax rate on land to four times that on buildings. In the
next two years, the value of private construction in Scranton rose 22
per cent. In contrast, Wilkes-Barre, 18 miles away, kept its old tax
system, and construction dropped 44 per cent during the same period. </small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Strapped
for funds in 1974, Harrisburg twice dropped
tax rates on buildings and twice increased rates on land. Almost every
homeowner got a tax break. McKeesport adopted the two-rate tax in 1980,
raising revenues 50 per cent and getting the town out of debt. More
remarkably, building investment rose 36 per cent, while falling 14 per
cent in neighboring Duquesne and more than twice that in nearby
Clairton. Since then, Duquesne, along with New Castle and Washington,
has adopted a two-rate tax. </small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The largest
American city using the two-rate tax is
Pittsburgh. After the city raised its land-tax rate to four times its
building-tax rate in 1979, new construction rose a healthy 14 per cent.
In 1980, the land-tax rate rose to five times the building rate, and
the value of construction shot up 212 per cent. When in 1982 the city
widened the gap to six times the building rate, the value of new
building permits rose 600 per cent.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>In all
these cities, despite a national recession
and a severe steel crisis in their region, changes in the property tax
structure produced results that were nothing short of startling. As
detailed in a <i>Fortune </i>article ("Higher Taxes That Promote
Development," August 8, 1983), housing and downtown buildings
increased in numbers and dollar value. Homeowners enjoyed tax
reductions, and housing costs were kept low. New construction jobs
eased losses in the industrial sector.</small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Poverty,
joblessness and homelessness have been
central concerns of religious social-action groups. There is a growing
awareness that neither private nor public charity is sufficient in
dealing with these problems. Shifting property taxes offers an
effective way to encourage public policy to be responsive to blighted
cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter
on the economy and parallel works by the Presbyterians, United
Methodists and the United Church of Christ. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The need to address
poverty&#8217;s basic causes, including the unhealthy concentration of
America&#8217;s land and resources in the hands of so few owners -- who have
tended to misappropriate land values -- ought to be high on our
religious and public policy agendas.</span></small></font>&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>

<p><small><font size="3"><small><b>Pennsylvania's Experience<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small> W.W.II, when its steel
industry plummeted,
Pittsburgh widened its two-to-one land-building ratio. The city watched
60 new buildings and skyscrapers, valued at $700 million then, stand up
in industrial areas. This privately financed renewal brought 16,000 new
jobs to an area that had employed 4,000. Then-Mayor David Lawrence,
noting the power of the stick, said the higher rate on land <i>"discouraged
hoarding of vacant land for speculation."</i> His successor, Mayor
Joseph Barr, noting the carrot effect, explained, <i>"Fine
structures erected through private investment as part of the renewal
program benefited by the lower tax rate on buildings."</i> When many
decaying cities were seeking federal aid, Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle
brought the city national fame.</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
In 1951 the Pennsylvania legislature granted all cities the two-rate
choice, omitting any ratio limits. Over two decades later in 1975,
Harrisburg, the capitol, shifted its property tax landward. The value
of its private real estate grew from $212 million in 1981, when it was
cited as the second most distressed city in the nation, to over $880
million in 1994. Its mayor during much of this recovery, Stephen Reed,
noted another benefit: <i>"Many
states try to save farmland by buying development rights. That's
expensive. Without spending a dime, we can achieve the same goal with a
two-tier tax. Unused urban land is what pushes development into open
spaces. This tax, by assuring better use of unused land in cities and
suburbs, will discourage the gobbling up of farms."</i></small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
Ailing, small towns in distressed Appalachia passed the shift in the
eighties: McKeesport, New Castle, Duquesne, Washington, Aliquippa,
Clairton, Oil City. In 1990 Titusville chimed in. A year later
Coatesville, DuBois, Hazleton, and Lock Haven followed. In 1996, after
repeated vetoes by the mayor, Allentown came on board with its 100,000
residents. That makes 16 municipalities with the two-rate property tax.
All of them are growing by densification unlike many of their neighbors.
</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
In 1992, Uniontown reversed its adoption of the PTS. (It was one of the
towns one of these co-authors lobbied. It seems he may have pushed to
hard. They accepted a higher initial rate which spurred a backlash
which scuttled the whole program. Damn eagerness!) Like many others in
the region, this city of 12,000 needed help; 80 percent of downtown
sites were empty. Their big mistake was to introduce the two-rate
reform under 34 year-old assessments which underestimated the value of
lots with abandoned structures. The few retailers left were hit with a
drastic increase. Moreover, officials did not give out public
information in advance. When people got their tax bills, they were
angered and uninformed, causing the city council to revoke the shift.</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
While the 1951 law abolished ratio limits, it has been used only to
increase the land portion. In 1979, Pittsburgh moved to a three-to-one
ratio and in a few years moved to six-to-one. Six others have chosen
five-to-one. In 1995 Washington, 30 miles from Pittsburgh, shifted to
taxing land 11 times higher than buildings; Aliquippa to 16-to-one.<br>
</small></font></small></p>
<small><font size="3"><small>
These spreads are diluted by overlapping counties and school districts
which still levy property taxes of one rate. When the city, county, and
school taxes are figured in, Pittsburgh is dampened to a 2.5-to-one
ratio. To address this lack of uniformity, the legislature granted
permission to school districts and boroughs the option to split their
rates. So far, only two noncity jurisdictions have taken advantage of
this option, totally 18 jurisdictions, including Pittsburgh, that have
opted for a higher rate on land and a lower one on buildings. Across
the Delaware River in New Jersey, officials recently held a public
hearing on the PTS. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Cities with either a phased-in two-rate
land-weighted system, as in Pennsylvania, or with a full land tax, as
in Australia and New Zealand, have consistently shown that:
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Taxes on the majority of
owner-occupied and rental homes were reduced.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> The steep escalation of housing
prices
and rents experienced by most US cities was averted in the two-rate
cities as housing supplies increased.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Construction and rehabilitation of
homes, stores, and offices increased.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> Central business districts drew
more private investment and were renewed.
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small> More efficient land use followed
putting the city's idle lots and under-used buildings into productive
use; reducing the pressure for urban sprawl. <strong>... 
    </strong></small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>Eventho' almost everyone would worry about
paying more tax, the PTS is
inherently progressive. Studies of the towns in Pennsylvania that have
shifted some tax from buildings to land show that about 75% come out
ahead (nearly the entire bottom four quintiles of income earners), 20%
break even and 5% pay more (together a bit larger than the top quintile
of income recipients), who are usually absentee owners.<strong> ... </strong><b><br>
</b></small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Is ownership of land <i>value</i>
concentrated? More so than other wealth? It's hard to unveil the
largest landowners who own land under different names or corporations,
or together with partners and family members. Best guesses tend to
underestimate the concentration. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">One study of a Pennsylvania town
of
15,000 found that 1.5 percent of landowners owned 53 percent of the
land value. Under a land tax, they would pay 53 percent of the revenue.
...</span></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of my talk is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span> I shall try to
explain why I believe that property taxation is one of the two chief
villains in the drama we are witnessing today in these United States.
The other villain is the monetary policy pursued by the government,
which has increased the cost of borrowing to a point where it stifles
the growth of the economy. In this context however I shall be concerned
only with property taxation. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">An analysis of the social and
economic
effects of a particular tax system would indicate the third criterion.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that
part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes
everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of
the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage. </small><br>
<br>
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap
large
profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
out of the market.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that
has
taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
properties.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes
on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are
low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Relatively low taxes on land and
high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many
disadvantages besides: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really
needed; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the building developer has to go far out to find available
land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>traffic on congested roads will increase and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>new roads and schools will have to be built.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is generally believed that zoning
laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities.
Zoning laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody
can be forced to improve his land and to build unless there is an
incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning
laws. With
both these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but
-- as experience has shown -- without land taxation rational and
efficient land usage becomes impossible.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector. ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>he administration of the property tax leaves very much to be
desired.
Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
tax bill will be.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.&nbsp; </span><small><big><big><a

While Healing The Earth</a><br>
<small><b>3. The rural landed
gentry. </b></small>
<p><small>Georgists have focused on urban land, stressing its
stupendous
value p.s.f., and also its high value per capita. Some have favored
ignoring rural areas completely, to placate the rural vote, and the
putative empathy of urban Americans with their rural roots, and the
supposed rural preservation of old cultural values. If those notions
ever had merit, they do not today. George himself did not think they
had merit in his day, either: his first book, <b><i>Our Land and Land
Policy</i></b> (1871) went into great detail about the villainies
(his word) involved in monopolizing rural land from the public
domain. He demolished economist Francis A. Walker while exposing how
Walker&#8217;s direction of the U.S. Census concealed the concentrated
ownership of rural land &#8211; an early example of &#8220;How to Lie
with Statistics.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the process,
George invented what today is
called the Lorenz Curve, and influenced the U.S. Census to begin
arranging data in a template geared to that curve, and to report on
land separate from buildings (which it did until 1940).</span> </small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today, more than ever,
persons of
great wealth have fled the
cities and bought up (or retained) vast and valuable lands in rustic
retreats. </span>To name but a few, there are San Juan County,
Washington;
Aspen, CO; Vilas and Walworth Counties, Wisconsin; Napa and Sonoma
Counties, CA; the Sta. Ynez Valley north of Sta. Barbara; Kenedy
County, TX; Barrington, IL; the Hudson Valley; Berkshire County, MA;
Nantucket Island, MA; Manchester/Dorset and Woodstock, VT; Fauquier
County, VA; Bourbon County, KY; and much of the whole State of NM. In
addition there are individual spreads so vast they constitute regions
in themselves: 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>San Simeon, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Newhall empire, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Bosworth and
Chandler and Tenneco ranches, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the King Ranch, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Sta. Catalina Island, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Irvine Company and the O&#8221;Neill holdings in Orange
County,
CA, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the McIlhenny lands in Louisiana, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Gardiner&#8217;s Island, New
York,</small></li>
  <li><small>&nbsp;the Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser timber
holdings, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the
Scully farms in Illinois, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the timber empires of northern Maine, and
so on. </small></li>
</ul>
<small>Once known mainly for blood sports, owners in these areas wrap
themselves now in the mantle of environmentalism &#8211; a major
challenge for those seeking to reconcile fair taxation with
ecological values.
</small>
<p><small>Where land is valued less for amenities, and more for cash
crops,
absentee ownership runs high in much of Iowa and central Illinois,
with rents going to Chicago lawyers and European investors. Likewise
the oven-like Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California, whose
absentee owners are more likely to live in coastal California, but
also have addresses all over the world &#8211; some real, and some in
tax havens (Gaffney, 1982). </small></p>
<p><small>In such regions, land values per capita run high. Vilas
County,
for example, an abandoned old &#8220;cutover&#8221; county centered on
Eagle River, now has the highest land value per capita in Wisconsin,
thanks to its many little lakes, and the high social status of
summering there. </small></p>
<p><small>There is no reason, in equity or efficiency, to exempt all
this
personal wealth from taxation. The challenge is to implement policies
to sift out the legitimate contributions to the environment from the
country club and boating and beachy and &#8220;trophy&#8221; and
&#8220;privacy&#8221; and &#8220;hunt club&#8221; and &#8220;fin and
feather&#8221; and &#8220;snow-bunny&#8221; qualities that give these
lands most of their market value. </small></p>
<p><small>Those rustic retreats are only the leading edge of manorial
suburbanization. Inside them we find low-density, high-valued suburbs
like Atherton, Belvedere, Rolling Hills, CA; Sag Harbor, Scarsdale,
NY; Lake Forest, IL; River Hills, WI; North Vancouver and Point Gray,
B.C.; West Palm Beach, FL; and so on. These are communities that fuel
today&#8217;s booming demand for landscape architects, and turn so
many retired golf professionals into country club designers and real
estate developers. </small></p>
<p><small>Here we find many activist Georgists suffering from another
blind
spot. A major modern Georgist thrust is to push for a local municipal
shift from the ordinary property tax to a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Two-rate&#8221;
system, with a higher rate on land than on buildings. </span>In doing
so,
they make a campaign issue and a litmus test of how the tax burden on
&#8220;homeowners&#8221; will fall. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Carried to an
oversimplified
extreme, this ignores all differences among &#8220;homeowners,&#8221;
melding the landed gentry on huge lots or vast acreages with the poor
in modest hovels on tiny crowded lots, or parts of lots.</span> It
ignores
the tax rate on rental apartment units, which almost everywhere is,
de facto, higher than on owned units. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We must be prepared for cases
where taxing those vast acreages will make the taxes of homeowners
rise &#8211; and explain why that is a good thing. </span></small></p>
<p><small>The &#8220;homeowner&#8221; orientation of many modern Georgist
campaigners plays into the hands of those who favor income taxation
and sales taxation over property taxation.&nbsp; If the goal is indeed
to
favor &#8220;homeowners&#8221; per se, then we should abandon the
property tax altogether in favor of income and sales taxes, in their
present biased forms. The imputed income of owner-occupied lands,
including lands held for sport and recreation, is entirely exempt
from income taxes, whose base exempts non-cash income. The imputed
consumption of these lands is also exempt from sales taxes.
