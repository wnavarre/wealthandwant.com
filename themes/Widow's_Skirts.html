Skirts, Orphans and Family Farmers</span></span></div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Widows' skirts are something like the
      Family Farmer whose farm is lost
      to the estate tax. (See David Cay Johnston's book, <em>Perfectly Legal:
      The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich
      &#8212; and Cheat Everybody Else,</em> chapter 6.) But Winston Churchill
      speaks of the Market
        Farmer outside Glasgow much the
      same way, and implores that we let the widow rest! (See below.)</p>
    <p> The Bible, like most other ethical systems, calls for us to take care
            of widows and
            orphans.&nbsp; But
            a
            lot of things get justified as protections for widows and orphans
            which largely serve much larger special interests. California's Proposition
            13 is a contemporary example. </p>
    <p> We don't worry nearly as much about the rack-rented tenant as we do about
      the person who claims they will not be able to afford their property taxes,
    while the latter has a huge asset to sell to the next generation, at prices
      that will keep them wage slaves for years. What a system!</p>
    <p>The alternative, of course, is to acknowledge that land is different from
      houses, that while buildings shouldn't be taxed at all, land value should
      be, and should be taxed rather heavily. Doing so will reduce the <em>price </em>of
      land, making it affordable to those who need it (but they won't buy more
      than they need for themselves, or speculate on it) and will put it to good
      use, either for housing or for commercial pursuits. </p>

  <p> Henry George:&nbsp; <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
 Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>It is that peasant proprietors
      would strengthen the existing
      system that makes schemes for creating them so popular among certain
      sections of the propertied classes of Great Britain. This is the
      ground on which these schemes are largely urged. These small
      landowners are desired that they may be used as a buffer and bulwark
      against any questioning of the claims of the larger owners. They
      would be put forward to resist the shock of "agrarianism," just as
      the women are put forward in resistance to the process-servers.
"What! do you propose to rob these poor peasants of their little
      homesteads?" would be the answer to any one who proposed to attack
      the system under which the larger landholders draw millions annually
      from the produce of labor.

    <p>That is what we strive for &#8212; for
          the freedom of all, for self-government to all (hear, hear) &#8212; and
          for as little government as possible: (Laughter and cheers) We don't believe
          that tyranny is a thing alone of kings and monarchs; we know well that
          majorities can be as tyrannous as aristocracies (hear, hear); we know that
          mobs can persecute as well as crowned heads. (Hear, hear) What we ask for
          is freedom &#8212; that in each locality, large or small, the people
          of that locality shall be free to manage the affairs that pertain only
          to
          that locality (hear, hear, and cheers); that each individual shall
          be free to manage the affairs that relate to him; that government shall
          not presume
          to say of whom he shall buy or to whom he shall sell, shall not attempt
          to dictate to him in any way, but shall confine itself to its proper
          function of preserving the public peace, of preventing the strong from
          oppressing
          the weak, of utilizing for the public good all the revenues that belong
          of right to the public, and of managing those affairs that are best
          managed by the whole. (Cheers) Our doctrine is the doctrine of freedom,
          our gospel
          is the gospel of liberty, and we have faith in it, why should we not?
          (Cheers)</p>
    <p>The Old Argument</p>
    <p>The People who say that such terrible things would follow the institution
        of the single tax are simply like the people who had predicted terrible
      things to follow the building of railroads and the abolition of chattel
      slavery.
        Why I remember, and Mr. Garrison well remembers, the day when in the
      United States all the arguments that are used in this country against the
      single
        tax were used against the abolition of chattel slavery, even down to
      the &quot;poor
        widow argument.&quot;</p>
    <p>We used to be told &#8212; I was only a boy then &#8212; we used to be told,
        when William Lloyd Garrison, father of this man, was the best denounced man
        on two continents, that it might be well if we could find the people who
        originally brought these slaves from Africa, to make them give them up. &quot;But,&quot; it
        was urged, &quot;these negroes are owned by people who paid their money for
        them. (Laughter) Would you take away from a man without any compensation
        the property that he bought?&quot; (Laughter) Then we used to be told, as
        you are told now, about that hard working mechanic. &quot;Here is a hard
        working laboring man. He has toiled early and late, and he has bought a slave
        to help him. Are you going to take a man's slave without compensation and
        rob him of the products of his labor?&quot; (Laughter) So they say today
        of the English mechanic, or English laborer, who has bought himself a little
        bit of land. And then we used to be told: &quot;Here is a man who worked
        hard and saved his money, and he invested in half-a-dozen slaves. He died,
        and those slaves are the only means of subsistence the widow has to support
        his orphan children. Would you emancipate those slaves, and let that poor
        widow and those little orphans starve to death?&quot; (Laughter)</p>
    <p>Slavery and Slavery</p>
    <p>It is the old, old story! And no wonder, for property in land is just
      as absurd! just as monstrous as property in human beings. (Hear, hear,
      and cheers)
        What difference does it make whether you enslave a man by making his
      flesh and blood the property of another, or whether you enslave him by
      making the
        property of another that element on which and from which he must live
      if he is to live at all? (A voice: &quot;None whatever!&quot; and cheers)</p>
    <p>Why, in those old days slave ships used to set out from this town of Liverpool
        for the coast of Africa to buy slaves. They did not bring them to Liverpool;
        they took them over to America. Why? Because you people were so good,
      and the Englishmen who had got to the other side of the Atlantic, and had
      settled
        there, were so bad? Not at all. I will tell you why the Liverpool ships
      carried slaves to America and did not bring them back to England. Because
      in America
        population was sparse and land was plentiful. Therefore to rob a man
      of his labor &#8212; and that is what the slaveowner wanted the slave for &#8212; you
        had got to catch and hold the man. That is the reason the slaves went to
        America. The reason they did not come here, the reason they were not carried
        over to Ireland was that here population was relatively dense, land was relatively
        scarce and could easily be monopolized, and to get out of the laborer all
        that his labor could furnish, save only wages enough to keep him alive even
        the slaveowner had to give this &#8212; it was only necessary to own
        land.</p>
    <p>What is the difference, economically speaking, between the slaves of South
        Carolina, Missouri, Mississippi, and Georgia and the free peasantry of
      Ireland or the agricultural laborer of England? (Cheers) Go to one of those
      slave
        states in the slave days, and there you would find a planter, the owner
      of five hundred slaves, living in elegant luxury, without doing a stroke
      of
        work, having a fine mansion, horses, [and a] carriage &#8212; all the
        things that work produces, but doing none of it himself. The people who
        did the
        work were living in negro huts, on coarse food; they were clothed in
        coarse raiment. If they ran away, he had the privilege of chasing them
        back, tying
        them up and whipping them and making them work.</p>
    <p>Come to this side of the Atlantic, in a place where you saw the same state
        of development. There you found also five hundred people living in little
        cabins, eating coarse food, clothed in coarse raiment, working hard, yet
        getting only enough of the things that work produces to keep them in good
        times, when bad times came having to appeal to the world for charity. But
        you found among those little cabins, too, the lordly mansion of the man who
        did no work. (Hear, hear, and groans)</p>
    <p>You found the mansion; you did not often find the man. (Laughter and cheers)
        As a general rule he was off in London, or in Paris, enjoying himself on
        the fruits of their labor. (Hear, hear) He had no legal right to make them
        work for him. Oh! no. If they ran away he could not put bloodhounds on their
        track and bring them back and whip them; but he had, in hunger, in starvation,
        a ban dog40 more swift, more keen, more sure than the bloodhound of the south.
        (Cheers)</p>
    <p>The slaveowner of the south &#8212; the owner of men &#8212; had to make
        those men work for him. He went to all that trouble. The landlord of Ireland
        did not have to make men work for him. He owned the land, and without land
        men cannot work; and so men would come to him &#8212; equal children of the
        Creator, equal citizens of Great Britain &#8212; would come to him, with
            their hats in their hands, and beg to be allowed to live on his land,
            to be allowed to work and to give to him all the produce of their
        work, except
            enough to merely keep them alive, and thank him for the privilege.

    a Cause of Poverty</a> (1909 speech in Parliament)</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... I do not think the Leader
of the Opposition could have chosen a
more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of
that great community for land was for not more than forty acres a
year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does
that really represent the complete economic and natural demand for
the amount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I
will admit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford
to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room
tenements; and we are told that the utmost land those people can
absorb economically and naturally is forty acres a year.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the explanation? Because
the population is congested in
the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
congested within the city. That is the position which we are
complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
hitherto dominated civilised society.</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>But
when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this
unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the widow</span>.
But that personality has been used to
exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,
overtime of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so
soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
life should become larger than it is at present.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the position disclosed
by the argument? On the one hand,
we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
spreads and who would not really be in the least injured. </small><small>...

      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p><strong>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game.
        The consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms,
        and slums and luxury in the cities.</strong> A great part of the necessary
        land is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
        until the poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm land also
        increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed, because
        they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. <strong>So the land becomes
        a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth accumulates
        and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering slums, and a
        small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes, which
        they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</strong></p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is wrecking
      modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole take
      the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could have
      land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social ends.
      ... </p>
  <p><strong>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy
        families, living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums.</strong> Here
        and there among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned
        what he is consuming, and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing
        still less to his children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest
        their money without breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might
        be grateful to learn about this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village
        of Arden, and see what its people are doing to make possible a peaceful and
        joyous life, even in this land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>

    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the

  <p><strong>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</strong> (5.)*</p>
  <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
    Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
    by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
  <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
    it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
    as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
    To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land
    to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
  <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
    the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold
    it as his own private possession.</p>
  <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
    for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
    he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only
    to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he
    pleases.</p>
  <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for greater
    security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages in another
    form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
    be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
  <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
    for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country, in
    my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
    defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
    bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the
    people. By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children
    from parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the
    buying and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
    with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived
    sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of
    his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here
    is a poor widow; all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes,
    the earnings of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by
    freeing these negroes?&#8221; And because of this perversion of reason, this
    confounding of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
    of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation
    a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
  <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
    property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same
    error into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same;
    it is essentially the same. Private property in land, no less than private
    property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. They are
    different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
    ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
    God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
  <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
    man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
    master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
    to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
    Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
  <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
    of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
    neck.</p>
  <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor of another
    without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully as chattel
    slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
    enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
    of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil
    do the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves
    of our Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner
    of Europe in ruder times to demand the jus primae noctis? Does not the same
    last outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
    wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
  <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
    on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine enriched
    their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men, they gave
    land. And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no free land
    remains to which the landless man may turn, then without further violence
    the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property in
    land takes the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient.
    For under it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when
    not needed. He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when
    no longer wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as
    efficacious. This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English
    conquerors of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land.
    This is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World, not
    to Europe.</p>
  <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
    form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in more
    insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory
    of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior
    monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending
    into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery
    the same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
    of the other!</p>
  <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What shall
    your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they demand
    of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare that
    he bought them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical,
    shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
    his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing
    and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing
    of his wages and thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock
    and bettering his condition in life&#8221;? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

Capacity of Land </a></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Making the property tax
more progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
State law allows the SID to contract with the landowner as follows.<small>
You don't have to pay your annual charge
in
cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></small></font></small></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a
good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;We also hear, sometimes,
that "it's never been done," or
it's only been done by our drab neighbor Pennsylvania, for whom
familiarity may have bred contempt? Only "far kine have long horns."
Or, whatever progress ensued there was happening anyway. We are
destiny's tots in the grip of cosmic forces. We rise and fall with
the tide. We cannot control Fate; relax and accept what the gods dish
out. Fatalism: it's a sure recipe for milling around ineffectually
while life passes us by.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

increments and reality in California's recall

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California homeowners are
wallowing in unearned increments beyond
the dreams of avarice, while its governments are courting bankruptcy. <a
 href="../docs/Buffett_Prop13.html">Warren Buffett</a> dared point
this out, and overnight changed from
the Oracle of Omaha into the Numbskull of Nebraska because he does
not understand the "reality of California politics," the oxymoron du
jour.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>Most candidates
for Governor fled like startled deer.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Buffett's
sponsor, well-tailored Mr. Muscles, recalled meeting a tearful widow
who said she would have been taxed out of her home were it not for
Prop 13. Poor thing, her home had risen in value. No one asked her
name, or whether she knew what she was talking about, or had her
claims audited - being a tearful widow "on a fixed income" insulates
one from reality checks.</span> The press chimed in with pix of poster
oldsters, gazing from their multi-million dollar perches over the
blue Pacific, fretting about Buffett's solecism and its possible
effect on them, never mind anyone else.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fact is, unearned increments ARE
income, at the time they accrue. Illiquid? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">They are better than cash income because
you can turn them
into cash by borrowing on them, and pay no income tax on the cash. If
you have trouble with that, the tax man himself will arrange it
for you by placing a tax lien on your appreciated home, rather than
foreclose and evict you. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This
helps explain why we never actually
see one of these evicted widows suffering from unearned increments --
they are maudlin figments for mythmakers.</span> The evictees we do see
are renters who couldn't pay, and had no equity to mortgage. Who
cries for them?</span> <strong>...</strong><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Governor Gray Davis, supposedly
fighting to close a deficit,
chimed in endorsing Prop 13, citing the mythical widow again to
explain why non-residential property, about 2/3 of the tax base,
should enjoy low rates. Faced with a negative poll, he backed right
down from his "land tax on wheels," the higher vehicle registration
fee.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>No one has said a word about a severance tax on oil and
gas,
although California is the only major producing state without one.&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>No one has crusaded for a severance tax on water
withdrawals,
although it would solve both our revenue and water crises in one
stroke. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>No one has said word one about taxing the taboo lands used
for golfing, timber, or farming. <strong>...</strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Only
Cruz Bustamante has proposed any specifics. He would begin
dismantling Prop 13 -- still not menacing the mythical widow -- by
raising assessments on industrial/commercial property.</span> A
whispering
campaign right off has it that Bustamante is leading an Hispanic
conspiracy to take over the southwest and turn "white, European"
Americans into a minority to kick around. We observe mixed marriages
on every hand, and Spain is still European, but this is California,
where "reality" means mythology. May Warren Buffett continue to get
in our faces with facts.&nbsp;</small><small> ...<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>Wealthy investors
have won congressional support for
real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).</big></small> Household real estate

popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This element of monopoly, of
appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the "protection of the
American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe."</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions.</span>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</small><small>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In

real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,

speculators. Environmentalists cozy up to landed gentry as soon as
these set aside some land for wildlife, and abate the bloodlust of
their foxhunting. The challenge for educators and economists is to
explain that their role in the land market can be just as anti-social
as those who are more transparently aggressive and greedy. It is a
mighty challenge, I allow; but it is what&#8217;s out there, and we
must face it, or settle for tokenism that absorbs our lives and
resources while papering over the major issues.... <a

Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The dominance of "fusers" is
shown by the prevalence of 2-factor models, wherein the world is
divided into just labor and capital.3 Land is melded with capital, and
simply disappears as a separate category, along with its distinctive
attributes.&nbsp; A number of economists don't buy it, but don't do
anything about it - acquiescing in error by silence, indifference,
passivity, or anxiety of the professional consequences.&nbsp; They
handle the question by "going into denial," as it were, resolving a
vexing issue by pretending it isn't there. Anything else spoils the web
of interpretation through which their art seeks to make human
experience intelligible.&nbsp; Truth will not be made manifest by
donning blinders or hedging, especially against such motivated forces
as have an interest in hiding unearned wealth behind the skirts of
capital. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not convertible into
other land.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<small>Each unit of land is permanently unique.&nbsp; Capital, on the
other hand, is a homogeneous "pool" over time: as each unit degrades
and yields back its substance, the owner may reinvest the Capital
Consumption Allowances in anything.&nbsp; Thus, capital is fungible:
one specific item of capital is universally convertible into any
other.&nbsp; Land is not at all fungible: no specific unit of land is
convertible into any other.</small><br>
<br>
<small>J.B. Clark, as is well known, tried to wipe out this
distinction, which brought him into debate with Boehm-Bawerk over
whether capital has a "period of production".&nbsp; Frank Knight,
following Clark, renewed the debate with Friedrich von Hayek.&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> The intent of both Clark and
Knight was to shelter land behind the skirts of capital, to counter a
popular movement for taxing land more and capital less.&nbsp; Students
are still required to study these dreary, mystical exchanges, which
seem to have no other purpose.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The rate of turnover of capital may vary, and does, over a wide
range, from once a day for restaurant fresh vegetables to once a
century for slow growth timber.&nbsp; Thus, the "valence" with which
capital combines with labor is highly variable.&nbsp; The land/labor
valence is not fixed, but it contains no such extreme factor as this.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Annual revaluation of land for
tax purposes might seem to impose
extra uncertainty on landowners, in comparison to the lot of lessees
on fixed terms. However it is only the amount of the tax that is
uncertain; the principle of it is known and certain. Furthermore the
principle is such that the tax only rises when exogenous forces raise
the earning potential of land; thus the added tax is neither
arbitrary nor grievous to bear. When exogenous forces lower earnings,
they also lower the tax burden, so that the fisc shares the risk with
landowners.</small> </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Annual revaluation occasionally
will penalize a landowner when the
best use of land changes in the midlife of a durable building.
Anticipating that hazard, landowners in some times and places will
avoid long commitments. This is not such a bad effect, however. Life
is uncertain; economic tides are uncertain; optimal land use calls
for frequent adjustments to new forces and data. Therefore the most
fixed, durable improvement should rarely be encouraged. It is too
ponderous and inflexible, too likely to be a monument or white
elephant that will obsolesce before it pays off. Some examples are
the C&amp;O Canal, the Great Wall of China, the Edsel plant, the
Maginot Line, and a dozen buildings we could all pick out in our own
cities. In my own neighborhood, near a growing shopping center, over
half the parcels have been cleared and rebuilt in the last fifteen
years, even without any tax stimulus. In dynamic times and places it
is good for builders to anticipate fairly early demolition and
renewal, and plan accordingly.... <a

<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix: FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q7. If a man owns a city lot with a $5000 building on it, what, under
      the single tax, would hinder another man, perhaps with hostile intent,
      from bidding a higher tax than the first man was able to pay, and thus
      ousting him from his building?</em></p>
  <p>A. The question rests upon a misapprehension of method. The single tax is
    not a method of nationalizing land and renting it out to the highest bidder.
    It is a method of taxation. And it would not only hinder, it would prevent
    the unjust ousting of another from his building. The single tax falls upon
    land-owners in proportion to the unimproved value of their land; and this
    value is determined by the real estate market &#8212; by the demands of the
    whole community &#8212; and not by arbitrary bids. No one could oust a man
    from his building by bidding more for the land on which it stood than the
    occupier was paying; the single tax would not be increased in any case unless
    the land upon which it fell was in so much greater demand that the owner
    could let it for a higher rent. </p>
  <p><em>Q50. Would not the single tax take away the home place, and so tend to crush
    out the home sentiment?</em><br>
    A. When the home place now becomes valuable, it is parted with.</p>
  <p><em>Q51. Yes; but when the home place is parted with now, the home owner is
    compensated by the high price he gets.</em><br>
    A. Then your question does not turn upon the home sentiment but upon the
    dollar sentiment. As a matter of sentiment, the condition would be no worse
    in any case than now, and in many cases far better; as a matter of dollars,
    the question is one of justice and not of the home. Under the single tax
    any one who wanted a home could have it, and never be obliged to abandon
    one home for another, unless such changes took place in the neighborhood
    as to make the place inappropriate for a home. He could not then, as he does
    now, play dog in the manger, saying to the community, &quot;I will not use
    this place for appropriate purposes, nor will I allow any one else to do
    so.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q56. Rich man with large mansion; poor widow with small house on same sized
    lot adjoining. The two pay the same tax. Is that right?</em><br>
    A. There is no reason in justice why the community should not charge poor
    widows as much for monopolizing valuable land as it charges rich men. In
    either case it confers a special privilege and should be paid what the privilege
    is worth. The question is seldom asked in good faith. Poor widows who live
    on lots adjoining large mansions are not numerous, and when they exist they
    are simply land-grabbers. In our sympathy for these widows, let us not forget
    the vast armies of widows who not only do not live next to mansions, but
    have no place in the whole wide world upon which to rest. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read
