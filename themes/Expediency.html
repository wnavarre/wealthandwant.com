  </p>
  <p align="left">Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The
  Single Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)      </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To show briefly why we urge this
change, let me treat (1) of
<b><i>its expediency, </i></b>and (2) of <b><i>its
justice.</i></b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may expect
these
<small><small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:</small></small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. It would dispense with
a whole army of tax gatherers and other officials which present taxes
require, and place in the treasury a much larger portion of what is
taken from people, while by making government simpler and cheaper, it
would tend to make it purer. It would get rid of taxes which
necessarily promote fraud, perjury, bribery, and corruption, which lead
men into temptation, and which tax what the nation can least afford to
spare--honesty and conscience. Since land lies out-of-doors and cannot
be removed, and its value is the most readily ascertained of all
values, the tax to which we would resort can be collected with the
minimum of cost and the least strain on public morals. </small>
  <p><small>2. It would enormously increase the production of wealth--</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>(a) By the removal of the burdens that now weigh
upon industry and thrift. If we tax houses, there will be fewer and
poorer houses; if we tax machinery, there will be less machinery; if we
tax trade, there will be less trade; if we tax capital, there will be
less capital; if we tax savings, there will be less savings. All the
taxes therefore that we would abolish are those that repress industry
and lessen wealth. But <b>if we tax land values, there will be no less
land.</b> </small>
    <p><small>(b) On the contrary, <b>the taxation of land values has
the effect of making land more easily available by industry,</b> since
it makes it more difficult for owners of valuable land which they
themselves do not care to use to hold it idle for a large future price.
While the abolition of taxes on labor and the products of labor would
free the active element of production, the taking of land values by
taxation would free the passive element by destroying speculative land
values and preventing the holding out of use of land needed for use. If
any one will but look around today and see the unused or but half-used
land, the idle labor, the unemployed or poorly employed capital, he
will get some idea of how enormous would be the production of wealth
were all the forces of production free to engage.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>(c) <b>The taxation of the processes and products of
labor on one hand, and the insufficient taxation of land values on the
other, produce an unjust distribution of wealth</b> which is building
up in the hands of a few, fortunes more monstrous than the world has
ever before seen, while the masses of our people are steadily becoming
relatively poorer. These taxes necessarily fall on the poor more
heavily than on the rich; by increasing prices, they necessitate a
larger capital in all businesses, and consequently give an advantage to
large capitals; and they give, and in some cases are designed to give,
special advantage and monopolies to combinations and trusts. On the
other hand, the insufficient taxation of land values enables men to
make large fortunes by land speculation and the increase of ground
values--fortunes which do not represent any addition by them to the
general wealth of the community, but merely the appropriation by some
of what the labor of others creates.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small><b>This unjust distribution of wealth develops on the one
hand a class idle and wasteful because they are too rich, and on the
other hand a class idle and wasteful because they are too poor</b>. It
deprives men of capital and opportunities which would make them more
efficient producers. It thus greatly diminishes production.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>(d) <b>The unjust distribution which is giving us the
hundred-fold millionaire on the one side and the tramp and pauper on
the other, generates thieves, gamblers, and social parasites of all
kinds,</b> and requires large expenditure of money and energy in
watchmen, policemen, courts, prisons, and other means of defense and
repression. It kindles a greed of gain and a worship of wealth, and
produces a bitter struggle for existence which fosters drunkenness,
increases insanity, and causes men whose energies ought to be devoted
to honest production to spend their time and strength in cheating and
grabbing from each other. Besides the moral loss, all this involves an
enormous economic loss which the Single Tax would save.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>(e)<b> The taxes we would abolish fall most heavily on
the poorer agricultural districts, and tend to drive population and
wealth from them to the great cities</b>. The tax we would increase
would destroy that monopoly of land which is the great cause of that
distribution of population which is crowding the people too closely
together in some places and scattering them too far apart in other
places. Families live on top of one another in cities because of the
enormous speculative prices at which vacant lots are held. In the
country they are scattered too far apart for social intercourse and
convenience, because, instead of each taking what land he can use,
every one who can grabs all he can get, in the hope of profiting by its
increase in value, and the next man must pass farther on. Thus we have
scores of families living under a single roof, and other families
living in dugouts on the prairies afar from neighbors--some living too
close to each other for moral, mental, or physical health, and others
too far separated for the stimulating and refining influences of
society. The wastes in health, in mental vigor, and in unnecessary
transportation result in great economic losses which the Single Tax
would save.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; <a
