<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The simple efficiency
argument for taxing land</span></small><br>
<small>A tax creates a difference, a &#8216;wedge&#8217;, between the price that a
buyer
pays and the price that the seller receives.&nbsp; Sometimes the wedge
generated by a tax is enough to inhibit a transaction that would
otherwise occur.&nbsp; If the tax that must be paid on a transaction is
greater than the gains from trade that would accrue in the absence of a
tax, then the tax precludes any mutually advantageous trade.&nbsp; Thus
taxes often reduce economic efficiency. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing Land is Better Than
Neutral</span></small><br>
<small>The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;,
that
is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.</small><br>
<br>
<small>First, a land tax can be used to take account of positive and
negative
externalities associa&shy;ted with land use.&nbsp; The typical example
of a negative externality is pollution.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The last way in which a
tax on land can be better than neutral is that
it can reduce inefficiency associated with land speculation.&nbsp;
If everyone had the same view as to what the future held, then there
would be no possibility of making speculative gains.&nbsp; But people
differ in their views about the future, creating opportunities for
people to engage in speculations that they believe will be
profitable.&nbsp; For speculations in widely traded standardized
commodities, it is not necessary to own the commodity to speculate; one
can speculate through futures contracts.&nbsp; With land however, while
there are some rudimentary futures contracts, these are available in
only a few places and do not reflect the individual variations in land
values that arise because of land&#8217;s locational fixity.&nbsp; Therefore
most of the speculations that people might wish to make with respect to
land require that the speculators own land for the duration of the
speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In theory, land speculation can either improve or worsen
economic
efficiency.&nbsp; The way that land speculation can improve efficiency
is by preventing the premature development of land at suboptimal
intensity.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The way that land speculation can worsen economic efficiency is
by
giving land the greatest value to those who make the most foolish
overestimates of the rate at which it will rise in value.&nbsp; The
result is that much land is owned by people who have paid more for it
than can ever be recovered from its use.&nbsp; This is an example of a
phenomenon that economists call &#8216;the winner&#8217;s curse&#8217;.&nbsp; ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Efficiency of
Site Value Rating<br>
</b></small><small>Where justice requires that the value generated by
land be shared
equally among citizens, efficiency requires that land be managed by
persons, individually or in firms, who receive the benefits and bear
the losses of the management decisions that they make. Thus
efficiency requires secure private titles to land. But secure private
titles are consistent with requiring title holders to pay the rental
value of land to the public treasury on an annual basis. That is,
secure private titles are consistent with site value rating. Site
value rating is economically efficient because it is not, like other
taxes, a public appropriation of a part of what is produced, but
rather social collection of the value in alternative activities of
naturally or socially generated resources that are appropriated by
individuals. Site value is not produced by the owners of sites. It is
what is there before they begin to use sites.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Site value rating embodies the
principle that people are allowed
to keep what they produce and must pay annually for the value of the
naturally occurring and socially created resources they use. This
principle can be extended to take account of individual actions that
have noticeable effects on the rental value of land surrounding that
which individuals use themselves. When land is used in such a way as
to raise the rental value of surrounding land, as by providing
parking near a commercial center or by providing improvements that
are beautiful to see, the person who creates that value should
receive it. Correspondingly, when people use land in such a way as to
lower the value of surrounding land, by generating noise, noxious
smells, air pollution, or unsightly views, they should be charged
according to the reduction in the rental value of the surrounding
land that results from their activity. The opportunity to be paid for
adding to the value of surrounding land will generally make land more
valuable. And the requirement to pay for harmful consequences of land
use will tend to inhibit such uses of land. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
  <p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
    course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax.
    Most basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form,
    and they constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of
    any particular tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such
    principles but little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless
    of ideology or government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency,
    equity, administrability, simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax
    theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or all of
    these criteria: ... </p>
  <p><strong>Tax efficiency</strong> is much like tax neutrality, and is the
    measure of how much shifting of behavior it imposes, resulting in what is
    called &quot;excess burden,&quot; or &quot;deadweight loss&quot; on the economy.
    Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes are those that are shifted
    little if at all. Because the elasticities (a technical word for the slope
    of supply and demand curves) of each are very different, a tax on land values
    and a tax on improvement values have very contrastive effects on economic
    choices. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity is the best
    way of assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is another way
    of saying fixed supply. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If
we regard human beings as having
equal moral worth, then it is morally wrong for some to be masters and
others slaves.</span> Each person therefore has proper moral ownership
of his labor and wage. Such self-ownership does not extend to land, but
people may properly have individual rights to possess land, since this
is necessary for the application of labor, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it is efficient for land
to be under private title and control.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But it is not necessary for
efficiency for the pure land rent to belong
to the individual title holder.</span> Economists use the term
"economic rent"
for payments beyond what is needed to put a factor of production to
efficient use. Land rent is economic rent, since the land is already
there, and for real estate, the amount of land within some boundary
line is fixed. So when rent is used for the public finances, it does
not reduce the quantity of land. The rent will not be passed on to the
tenant, since the payment of the rent to a community does not change
the supply or demand for land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The use of rent for public revenues therefore has no excess
burden, no
burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
land rather than raise it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal
source of
general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.
Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
other forms of land. There could also be user fees for services
specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
enterprises.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from
minerals,
water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
circumstances.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rent.html">Read the

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I. Justifications
of Land Value Taxation</b>
</small><br>
<small>Land value taxation is sometimes justified on the ground that,
unlike almost all other sources of public revenue, a tax on land
value does not impose an excess burden on an economy. This argument
can be found in the writings of the <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/themes/Physiocrats.html">Physiocrats</a>,
Adam Smith, David
Ricardo, and numerous modern writers. It is based on the fact that,
with a properly administered tax on land value (unlike other taxes),
it is not possible for a person to lower the tax that is due by being
unproductive.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If people were concerned only with
efficiency, this would be a
fine reason to use land value taxation. But people are also concerned
with issues of justice, or fairness. And so the question arises of
whether taxing land values is fair. The fairness of taxing land
values is generally defended on the basis of the postulate that
natural opportunities are everyone's common heritage; collecting the
value of exclusive use of these opportunities and using the proceeds
for public purposes is a way of sharing the value of these
opportunities while retaining the efficiency of private control of
resources. <b>... </b><a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Read

  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.</font></p>

  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
      <br />
  Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing
  the processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
  do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
  tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the
  payer works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes
  it, of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 25 or in lesser
  degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
  tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
  taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. I.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">25. It is common, besides taxing improvements, as fast
        as they are made, to levy higher taxes upon land when put to its best
        use than when put to partial use or to no use at all. This is upon the
        theory that when his land is used the owner gets full income from it
        and can afford to pay high taxes; but that he gets little or no income
        when the land is out of use, and so cannot afford to pay much. It is
        an absurd but perfectly legitimate illustration of the pretentious doctrine
        of taxation according to ability to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Examples are numerous. Improved building lots, and even
        those that are only plotted for improvement, are usually taxed more than
        contiguous unused and unplotted land which is equally in demand for building
        purposes and equally valuable. So coal land, iron land, oil land, and
        sugar land are as a rule taxed less as land when opened up for appropriate
        use than when lying idle or put to inferior uses, though the land value
        be the same. Any serious proposal to put land to its appropriate use
        is commonly regarded as a signal for increasing the tax upon it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers through
    many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase
        prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer,
        increasing as they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been
        often attempted, the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and
        the borrower must pay it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses
        it in his business, he in his turn must get back the tax from his customers,
        or his business becomes unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings,
        the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
        will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular
        profit and the tax besides. If we impose a tax upon manufactures or imported
        goods, the manufacturer or importer will charge it in a higher price
        to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and the retailer to the consumer.
        Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only
        pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this amount to everyone
        who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital he has advanced
        in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Perfect Tax</strong></p>
  <p>In the final analysis, a tax should be evaluated according to the tenets
    of sound tax theory that have evolved over the course of recent centuries,
    and
      much of what has been said above is recaptured by a review of those principles.
      These measures of what is a &quot;good&quot; tax or a &quot;bad&quot; tax are
      often listed differently in textbooks, but they are largely agreed upon. Failure
      to conform to these venerable benchmarks is by itself sufficient cause to explain
      an economy's faltering &#8212; a particularly noteworthy example today
      is the city of Philadelphia which appears to have done everything backward!
      It taxes
      income, sales, building capital and even business privilege, the result
      being that its fisc is destitute.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> The
      principles by which to measure tax design are enumerated here so as to
      make quite clear how recapturing economic rent in the form of taxes &#8212; in all
      the several forms where 'land' can be identified &#8212; constitutes the
      best method of financing government services and the most advantageous
      to cities.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[21]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>The first measure of a good tax is its neutrality. A neutral tax in no way
      alters the behavior of its partners from what would transpire were there
    no tax at all. A simple example illustrates the case: today many consumers
    will
      travel to alternate jurisdictions to avoid paying a sales tax on particular
      items, be they food, medication, clothing, or whatever. Taxes fully absorbed
      (&quot;capitalized&quot;) in a market price such as land taxes in no way
      distort behavior, the volume of transactions, or gross prices. They are
      neutral.</p>
  <p>A tax should also be efficient. To be sure, efficiency has many meanings even
      in economics. But here, rather than speaking of the administrative efficiency
      of its collection as will be addressed below, the measure is whether and how
      much it constitutes an excess burden on the economy, thereby slowing down performance
      and market vitality. Many taxes, as was mentioned earlier, exert so much drag
      on market transactions that they are destructive, however much revenue is brought
      to government coffers. Because land has a fixed supply there is no excess burden
      at all.</p>
  <p>People are frequently most concerned about the fairness of a tax, which
    is typically measured according to both horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal
      equity means that those in similar circumstances will bear similar burdens.
      Vertical equity prescribes that those with greater resources will pay more.
      Although studies have yet to show this, land taxes are likely the most &quot;progressive&quot; of
      any levy, as tenants bear no passed-through burden at all.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[22]</em></strong></font> Not
      only does no household or office tenant bear any tax burden, locational
      sites distant from the urban core, mostly homeowners and farmers, typically
      find
      their burden reduced. Vacant or underused lots in high value areas pick
      up the difference, employing a design that employs an alternate criterion
      of equity:
      taxing according to use. &quot;Paying for what you take and not for what you
      make&quot; encourages efficient consumption of space and resources in an
      automatic and non-coercive manner. The one-third of households that own
      no land are relieved
      of all taxes, and residential and non-residential property owners split
      the rest. Farmers, whose land is typically of inconsequential value relative
      to
      sites in urban areas, are likely to pay little if anything even if they
      are not already protected by other save-harmless provisions. By eliminating
      taxes
      on building improvements they typically enjoy savings just as do other
      businesses.</p>
  <p>All this makes for a far simpler and more comprehensible system of taxation.
      Land taxes are totally transparent, impossible to evade, and therefore
    much more administrable. This further engenders the legitimacy of taxation
    and of
      government itself. What it also does is assure stability to the tax system,
      for the reason that land values are not subject to the variations and vacillations
      that other tax bases frequently have. Indeed, the removal of economic rent
      from locational sites discourages speculative bubbles and the related economic
      cycles that are associated with them. This greater stability and reliability
      is to the advantage of every sector of the economy &#8212; private, public,
      and non-profit.</p>
  <p>A tax that collects economic rent offers a win-win proposition to every
    sector of the community &#8212; except to those who speculate in land. But
    who wants to favor land speculators? They are not held in high regard anywhere;
    their
      destructive behavior is the bane of cities, recognized everywhere for what
      it is: parasitic and passive. Speculators provide no added value to a community's
      well-being, and taxing rent is a foolproof means by which to eliminate
    it. Land speculation is highest where the most rent can be privately captured,
      but it forces those who choose to develop to look to sub-optimal locations
      when the primary locations they hoped for are held off the market for opportunistic
      gain. By collecting rent, primary choice locations become available for
    use
      and to facilitate the development of land use configurations ideal for
    the economic health and efficient allocation. Urban ambience is improved,
    public
      sector service costs are reduced, and sprawl development is stemmed. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>It reconciled equity and
efficiency. It constituted a progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because a tax on land is
essentially a flat rate percent levied on a
base of assessed full market value, it is simple and easy for people to
understand. On account of that attribute, a tax on land value is easily
visible and is perceived by the public to be fair. Finally, now that
applied computer technology can be used to accurately assess the value
of land whether or not it is improved, one of the last traditional
objections to the administrative feasibility to land value taxation has
been allayed. All this enhances the legitimacy of government. The tax
is therefore not simply efficient from the narrow measure of tax
efficiency as described above. It is efficient also in the broader
sense, by its ability to foster sounder government performance, better
community relations, more livable community configurations, and
enhanced social productivity.&nbsp; It is not just from the standpoint
of tax theory alone that a tax on land should be evaluated. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The Georgist main agenda, as earlier noted, is economic justice.
If one searches the term &#8220;economic justice&#8221; online, the first site that
will appear is the Georgist website, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">progress.org</a>.
The starting point
is that people are entitled to what they earn, but only to what they
earn.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small>
The fruits of the commons generated in rent might also be distributed
to citizens equally if not used to finance the general services of
government. In practice this means the abolition of those taxes that
represent an unjust capture of one&#8217;s personal property &#8212; taxes such as
income, sales, and other nuisance taxes. It accepts, to be sure, the
need to collect user fees, Pigouvian taxes, and perhaps sumptuary (sin)
taxes. It argues aggressively for the collection of economic rent in
support of government and, for any remaining surplus, its distribution
as a citizens&#8217; dividend.&nbsp; The justification for the collection of
rent has several grounds: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the first is to preclude the entitlement of
windfall gains to those who have unfairly captured monopoly control of
parts of what are rightfully the public commons. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A second reason is to
enhance the efficiency of economic productivity which the failure to
collect rent prevents. It is not just that monopoly control of commons
sites drives less attractive and less valuable land into production
because the primary choices are unavailable; it is also that the use of
alternative taxes leads to a deadweight loss in the economy which
reduces the wealth of every citizen except the monopoly titleholder.The
proper collection of land rent leads to increases in economic
efficiency in a way that wages are not artificially depressed and more
opportunities arise in the labor market.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result of these factors
leads to a greater equality in the income of each person. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>    One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land
    nationalisation. But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on land
    could be effective
      in capturing the economic surplus arising from land ownership. This tax
      would generate all the revenue necessary to fund public expenditures. George
      thought that such a land tax would permit the removal of other taxes on
      labour and capital, which he regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued
      that taxes on incomes, sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives
      to production and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and
      creating a barrier to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be
      both economically efficient and more equitable in its distributional effects.
