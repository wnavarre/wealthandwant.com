<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>During the 1920s, New York City
taxed land but not new buildings
put on it. Construction more than tripled while in other big cities it
barely doubled. There were more jobs and higher wages for construction
workers, and more business for merchants who sold goods to the employed
workers. There were more buildings for new businesses that hired help.

Earth Brought Peace</small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>New Yorkers benefited before from geonomics.
    After World War I, the city lacked housing. Borrowing a page from former
    mayoral candidate Henry George, the council exempted new buildings but not
    underlying sites from taxation for the next ten years. During the first half
    of the Roaring 20s, new construction more than tripled while in other big
    cities it barely doubled. Economic good times came to an end when owners
    in 1928 began to anticipate the expiration of the exemption. Stalled housing
    starts helped trigger the Great Depression. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>More recently, Mayor Rudy Giuliani used
    to welcome the school year by <span style="font-weight: bold;">suspending
    for a week the tax on shoes and clothes</span>. Shoppers saved, stores profited,
    and the city took in more revenue. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If the city zeroed out taxes on all sales
    and wages, customers and workers would flock to the Big Apple, pumping up
    site values even higher, providing a fat fund for fixing up infrastructure. </span>That'd
    help owners redevelop both lower Manhattan and the blocks of vacant lots
and abandoned buildings in the Bronx and Bedford-Stuyvesant.&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these
      things are made by human beings. If customers are willing to buy more of
      them, then manufacturers
        will make more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply
      of land cannot be increased. If the demand for land increases, only one
      thing
      can
      happen: its price will go up. </p>
    <p>The owners of land see population and production
    go up, up, up &#8212; and
        no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an
    immediate need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait,
    because they
    expect the land's value to increase with time.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"> 
    <p>That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land
      problem &#8212; the problem
          of poverty.</p>
    <p>That is why millions upon millions of people who are willing and able to
      work cannot find work, even while millions upon millions of acres of useable
    land (city land, industrial land, farm land, you name it) are held idle. </p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">This leads to no end of problems. In the United
    States, it brings urban blight and suburban sprawl, which disrupt communities,
    and waste energy and
      resources. You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal? Consider
      the fact that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its land, or
      18.6 square miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not parks or streets.
      And, of course, a great deal more land in New York, as in every other city,
      is used somewhat, but far less than the local economy would support. New
      York City has about 80 people per acre of residential land. That means that
      New York&#8217;s vacant land could house another 956,000 people at current
      density levels, without even starting to use its vast stock of under-used
      land. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

  <p>Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable Capacity of Land </a> </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling a
        finding? Wisconsin is not a backward state. It prides itself on the high
        quality of its public administration. <b>What I did was study sites on
      the eve of demolition.</b></small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When you buy an old junker to tear down
        and replace with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing
        that the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the land.
        However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the building was
        worth about three times as much as the land, just before tear-down. That
      is a good way to measure to what extent land is underassessed.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Try that in Manhattan. When the visitor
        first gapes at its skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise.
        If you poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
        exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of it
      tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Check the Empire State Building. Old
          as it is, it is still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to
          its site, it is in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks
          from the 100% location (57th Street, I would guess). Even so, when the
          site and the building sold in separate transactions a few years ago,
          the site represented 1/3 of the total value. What does that say about
          the land fraction on neighboring parcels, covered only with the remains
          of ordinary old structures? What does that say about the land fraction
          nearer the 100% location?&nbsp; </b>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font
