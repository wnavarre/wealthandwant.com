  <p>Twenty years ago, could any of us have imagined how large a business bottled
      water would become, that many of us buy small bottles of water by the case,
      and pay as much for a bottle  in a vending machine as we pay for soda or
    juice?   A generation ago, we could depend on having drinkable water from

<small>There's an amusing story of a Georgist who challenged a land
baron as
to the baron's right to his vast tracts. The baron knew the history of
the estate of his noble bloodlines, and told how one of his ancestors
had paid good money for the land, rather than gaining it by some royal
grant. To this the Georgist replied, "But how did the previous owner
obtain it?" Again the baron explained how that person had also once
paid good money for it. Yet again and again, the Georgist persisted
with, "But how did that owner obtain it?" Finally, the baron said, "He
fought for it in battle, and won it". To which the Georgist said,
"Good! I'll fight you for it!"</small><br>
<br>
<small>To those interested readers we can make available copies of the
moving speech attributed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chief
Seattle</span>,
which explains his bewilderment at 19th century American laws of land
ownership. Chief Seattle compares land ownership to the ownership of
air and water, and even to the possession of the songs of birds. This
short speech perhaps conveys the Georgist philosophy better than
lengthy volumes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And here we have a fitting end point. The year is 2050, and
Kerry
Packer III has again increased every Australian's monthly air levies.
Some whingeing malcontents start to question our Airlord's right to
privately own what was once considered to be the natural birthright of
every person, but they are soon convinced that Kerry's grandfather
worked extremely hard for the billions with which he bought the
Southern Pacific Air License in 2020. In return for his contractual
obligations to maintain a specified level of air cleanliness, Kerry won
the "right" to extract an annual usage fee from every air-breathing
human residing in his territory.&nbsp; <a

<p>Robert Ingersoll: <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay Sermon</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No man should be allowed to own any land that he does not use. Everybody
        knows that &#8212; I do not care whether he has thousands or millions.
        I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as I know
        I am living
        that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use it. And why? <strong>Don't
        you know that if people could bottle the air, they would? Don't you know
        that
        there would be an American Air-bottling Association? And don't you know that
        they would allow thousands and millions to die for want of breath, if they
        could not pay for air? I am not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it
        is. Now, the land belongs to the children of Nature. Nature invites into
        this world every babe
    that is born. </strong>And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight,
    if
    I had invited you here &#8212; nobody had charged you anything, but you had been
    invited &#8212; and when you got here you had found one man pretending to occupy
    a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and thereupon you were
    compelled to stand up &#8212; what would you think of the invitation? It
    seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to his share of the land,
    and that
    he should not be compelled to beg the privilege to work the soil, of a babe
    that happened to be born before him. And why do I say this? Because it is
    not to our
    interest to have a
    few landlords and millions of tenants. ... <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">read the whole sermon</a></p>
