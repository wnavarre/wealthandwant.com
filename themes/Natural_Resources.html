Jean Paul Getty (1892-1976), billionaire oil tycoon<br>
</div>
 <blockquote>
   <p>Who owns America's natural resources? Our instant answer to that question
       isn't quite as fast as the answer to the question &quot;who own's America's airwaves?&quot;
       (to which the immediate answer tends to be &quot;the American people,&quot; though in
       fact we don't currently claim that ownership, instead allowing corporations
       to claim  it as if they created it). While corporations which extract resources
       do pay some royalties to the commons, a lot of that value is being privatized.</p>
   <p>The next question, of course, is &quot;who owns the natural resources in
     oil-rich areas?&quot; Is it the people of the country under whose sand those
     resources reside? Is it some of those people? Is it the shareholders of
     American corporations?
       Important questions to ponder. </p>
   <p>&quot;Land&quot; includes not only the acres under our feet, but the entire natural
       creation -- all those things which are not manmade and of which humans cannot
       create an additional supply. Improved technology may allow us to extract it
       more efficiently, or use it more efficiently, but when we use up all of a
       non-renewable resource, or pollute the air or water, we are robbing our children
       and future generations of their birthright.</p>

</ul>

could we ask the Creator to furnish us with that is not already here in
abundance? He has given us the globe amply stocked with raw materials
for our needs. He has given us the power of working up this raw
material.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If there seems scarcity, if there is want, if there are people
starving in the midst of plenty, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">is it not simply because what the
Creator intended for all has been made the property of the few? </span>And
in moving against this giant wrong, which denies to labor access to the
natural opportunities for the employment of labor, we move against the
cause of poverty.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Go into Pennsylvania, and there you will see great stretches of
land, containing enormous deposits of the finest coal, held by
corporations and individuals who are working but little part of it. On
these great estates the common American citizens who mine the coal are
not allowed even to rent a piece of land, let alone buy it. They can
only live in company houses; and they are permitted to stay in them
only on condition (and they have to sign a paper to that effect) that
they can be evicted at any time on five days&#8217; notice. The companies
combine and make coal artificially dear here, and make employment
artificially scarce in Pennsylvania.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, why should not those miners, who work on it half the time,
why shouldn&#8217;t they dig down in the earth and get up coal for
themselves? Who made that coal? There is only one answer &#8212; God made
that coal. Whom did He make it for? Surely you would say that God made
it for the people that would be one day called into being on this
earth. But the laws of Pennsylvania, like the laws of New York, say God
made it for this corporation and that individual; and thus a few people
are permitted to deprive miners of work and make coal artificially dear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A few weeks ago when I was traveling in Illinois a young fellow
got into the car at one of the mining towns. Entering into conversation
with him, he said he was going to another place to try to get work. He
told me of the condition of the miners, that they could scarcely make a
living, getting very small wages, and only working about half the time.
I said to him: "There is plenty of coal in the ground; why don&#8217;t you
employ yourselves in digging coal?" He replied: "We did get up a
co-operative company, and we went to see the owner of the land to ask
what he would take to let us sink a shaft and get out some coal. He
wanted $7,500 a year. We could not raise that much." Tax land up to its
full value, and how long can such dogs-in-the-manger afford to hold
that coal land away from these men? And when people who want work can
go and employ themselves, then there will be no million or no thousand
unemployed people in all the United States.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The relation of employer and employed is a relation of
convenience. It is not one imposed by the natural order. People are
brought into the world with the power to employ themselves, and they
can employ themselves wherever the natural opportunities for employment
are not shut up from them.</small><br>
<br>
<small>People do not have a natural right to demand employment of
another, but they have a natural right, an inalienable right, a right
given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves. And
whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want to go
to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there will be
as much competition among employers who are anxious to get people to
work for them, as there will be among people who are anxious to get
work. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

<p align="left">Louis Post: <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q11. How can mines be taxed without increasing the price of the out-put?</em><br />
A. By taxing the royalty, or, what is essentially the same, by taxing their capitalized
  value as mining opportunities. This would tend to lower rather than increase
  the price of the product. Read note 11.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Note 11: This is usually a stumbling block to those who,
        without much experience in economic thought, consider the single tax
        for the first time. As soon as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities
        shift to consumers they jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes upon
        land values would shift to the users. But this is a mistake, and the
        explanation is simple. Taxes upon what men produce make production more
        difficult and so tend toward scarcity in the supply, which stimulates
        prices; but taxes upon land, provided the taxes be levied in proportion
        to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning market supply of course),
        because they make it more difficult to hold valuable land idle, and so
        depress prices.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord. There
        are no means by which he can shift the burden upon anyone else. . . A
        tax on rent, therefore, has no effect other than its obvious one. It
        merely takes so much from the landlord and transfers it to the state.&quot; &#8212; <em>John
        Stuart Mill's Prin. of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. 1.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax laid upon rent is borne solely by the owner
        of land.&quot; &#8212;<em> Bascom's Tr., p.159.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Taxes which are levied on land . . . really fall
        on the owner of the land.&quot; &#8212; <em>Mrs. Fawcett's Pol. Ec. for
        Beginners, pp.209, 210.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land tax levied in proportion to the rent of land,
        and varying with every variation of rents, . . . will fall wholly on
        the landlords.&quot; &#8212; <em>Walker's Pol. Ec., ed. of 1887, p. 413,
        quoting Ricardo</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person
        who actually pays it to some other person varies with the object taxed.
        A tax on rents cannot be transferred. A tax on commodities is always
        transferred to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; <em>Thorold Rogers's Pol.
        Ec., ch. xxi, 2d ed., p. 285.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor,
        the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged
        to allow it in payment of the rent.&quot; &#8212; <em>Adam Smith's Wealth
        of Nations, book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the
        cost of production and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
        production, and taxes upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though
        a tax upon rent compels land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power
        to obtain more for the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce
        the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land
        on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land values
        tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to reduce
        the price of land.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book viii,
        ch. iii, subd. i.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting
        the tax in higher rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of
        shifting it to the consumers of goods in higher prices. The principle
        is the same. Merchants cannot charge higher prices for goods than their
        competitors do, merely because they pay higher ground rents. A country
        storekeeper whose business lot is worth but few dollars charges as much
        for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer whose lot is worth thousands.
        Quality for quality and quantity for quantity, goods sell for about the
        same price everywhere. Differences in price are altogether in favor of
        places where land has a high value. This is due to the fact that the
        cost of getting goods to places of low land value, distant villages for
        example, is greater than to centers, which are places of high land value.
        Sometimes it is true that prices for some things are higher where land
        values are high. Tiffany's goods, for instance, may be more expensive
        than goods of the same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But
        that is not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has
        a reputation for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad
        among rich people), for which his customers are willing to pay whether
        his store is on a high priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Though land value has no effect upon the price of good,
        it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in others. Therefore,
        though the price and the profit of each sale be the same, or even less,
        in good locations than in poorer ones, aggregate receipts and aggregate
        profits are much greater at the good location. And it is out of his aggregate,
        and not out of each profit, that rent is paid, For example: A cigar store
        on a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality of cigar for fifteen cents.
        On a side street the same quality of cigar can be bought no cheaper.
        Indeed, the cigars there are likely to be poorer, and therefore really
        dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare is very high compared with
        ground rent on the sidestreet. How, then, can the first dealer, he who
        pays the high ground rent, afford to sell as good or better cigars for
        fifteen cents than his competitor of the low priced location? Simply
        because he is able to make so many more sales with a given outlay of
        labor and capital in a given time that his aggregate profit is greater.
        This is due to the advantage of his location, and for that advantage
        he pays a premium in higher ground rent. But that premium is not charged
        to smokers; the competing dealer of the side street protects them. It
        represents the greater ease, the lower cost, of doing a given volume
        of business upon the site for which it is paid; add if the state should
        take any of it, even the whole of it, in taxation, the loss would be
        finally borne by the owner of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by
        the landlord. Any attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would be promptly
        checked by the competition of neighboring but cheaper land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land-tax, levied in proportion to the rent of
        land, and varying with every variation of rent, is in effect a tax on
        rent; and as such a tax will not apply to that land which yields no rent,
        nor to the produce of that capital which is employed on the land with
        a view to profit merely, and which never pays rent; it will not in any
        way affect the price of raw produce, but will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; <em> &#8212; McCulloch's

  <p><em>Q8. How about fertility value?</em><br />
A. On the surface of the globe are countless varieties of exhaustible fertility,
  i.e. chemical constituency, differing in kind and degree, from the nitrogen,
  hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon of the soil to the carbon of the coal, the gold,
  and the diamond. Fertility as an attribute need not be predicated of agricultural
  land alone. Economic fertility belongs equally to any other land which yields
  to labor its product whether in food, mineral, or metal. Land may be fertile
  in wheat, corn, and potatoes. It may be fertile in cotton, in tobacco, or in
  rice. It may be fertile in diamonds, in gold, silver, copper, lead, or iron.
  It may be fertile in oil, coal, or natural gas, in a water power or water front.
  The value of artificial fertility is an improvement value. The value of natural
  fertility of any kind is a site value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em><strong>LA:</strong> Let me ask you about demographic trends.
      Columnist Mark Steyn writes that in ten years, 40 percent of young men
      in the world are going to be living in oppressed Muslim countries. What
      do you think the effect of that is going to be?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> What happens will depend on whether we succeed in bringing
    some element of greater economic freedom to those Muslim countries. Just
    as India in 1955 had great but unrealized potential, I think the Middle East
    is in a similar situation today. In part this is because of the curse of
    oil. Oil has been a blessing from one point of view, but a curse from another.
    Almost every country in the Middle East that is rich in oil is a despotism.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Why do you think that is so?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> One reason, and one reason only &#8212; the oil is
    owned by the governments in question. If that oil were privately owned and
    thus someone's private property, the political outcome would be freedom rather
    than tyranny. This is why <strong>I believe the first step following the
    2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields.
    If the government had given every individual over 21 years of age equal shares
    in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate
    arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and
    developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form
    of dividends to the people &#8212; the shareholders &#8212; rather than into
    government coffers.</strong> This would have provided an income to the whole
    people of Iraq and thereby prevented the current disputes over oil between
    the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, because oil income would have been distributed
    on an individual rather than a group basis.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Many Middle Eastern societies have a kind of tribal

      difficult to establish a system of contract between strangers. Is it your
      view that the introduction of free markets in such places could overcome
      those obstacles?</em></p>
  <p>MF: Eventually, yes. I think that nothing is so important for freedom as
    recognizing in the law each individual's natural right to property, and giving
    individuals a sense that they own something that they're responsible for,
    that they have control over, and that they can dispose of.</p>

<p>Q Is there no tax you like?</p>
<p>A Yes, there are taxes I like. For example, the gasoline tax, which pays for
  highways. You have a user tax. The property tax is one of the least bad taxes,
  because it's levied on something that cannot be produced &#8212; that part
  that is levied on the land. So some taxes are worse than others, but all taxes
  are bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go to the work of Henry George himself and learn how many of the troubles
      from which society still suffers, and suffers increasingly, are due to the
      fact that a few have monopolized the land, and that in consequence they have
      the power to dictate to others access to the land and to its products -- which
      include waterpower, electricity, coal, iron and all minerals, as well as the
      foods that sustain life -- and that they have the power to appropriate to their
      private use the values that the industry, the civilized order, the very benefactions,
      of others produce. This wrong is at the very basis of our present social and
      economic chaos, and until it is righted, all steps toward economic recovery
      may be temporarily helpful while in the long run useless. ...</p>
  <p>I do not claim that George's remedy is a panacea that will cure by itself
      all our ailments. But I do claim that we cannot get rid of our basic troubles
      without it. I would make exactly the same concession and same claim that Henry
      George himself made: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I do not say that in the recognition of the equal
            and unalienable right of each human being to the natural elements from
        which life must be supported and wants satisfied, lies the solution of all
        social
            problems. I fully recognize that even after we do this, much will remain
        to do. We might recognize the equal right to land, and yet tyranny and spoilation
            be continued. But whatever else we do, as along as we fail to recognize
        the
            equal right to the elements of nature, nothing will avail to remedy that
        unnatural inequality in the distribution of wealth which is fraught with
        so much evil
            and danger. Reform as we may, until we make this fundamental reform,
        our material progress can but tend to differentiate our people into the monstrously
        rich
            and frightfully poor. Whatever be the increase of wealth, the masses
        will still be ground toward the point of bare subsistence -- we must still
        have our great
            criminal classes, our paupers and our tramps, men and women driven to

  <p>We tend to have a very romantic conception of land, in this day and age. I'm
    not sure why, but I suspect it has to do with how seldom modern people actually
    come into contact with the stuff of the earth itself. We deal with burgers...
    papers... toilets... Without thinking about the many layers of processing between
  hayfield and burger, between tree and paper, between flush and water table. </p>
  <p> We think of dropping out of the modern plastic world to go &quot;back to
    the land.&quot; &quot;The land&quot; is where we go on camping trips.</p>
  <p> This romantic conception of land can lead to some dangerously fuzzy thinking.
      It leads us to think, for example, that perhaps land used to be absolutely
      vital to human life, back in some halcyon, underpopulated past &#8212; but
      modern technology has long since taken care of that.</p>
  <p>Or has it?</p>
  <p> Let's think about this question: what is our most valuable natural resource?
    Is it<br>
&#8212; gold, diamonds, precious or strategic minerals? Nope, not even close.<br>
&#8212; Oil? Well, it's highly important to industrial civilization, of course,
  a matter of great political import &#8212; but by no means the most valuable.<br>
&#8212; Water? Now we're getting closer: necessary for life, to be sure, and
  thus a potential object of wars &#8212; but in terms of cost per cubic foot,
  not so terribly high, yet. </p>
  <p>What is it? Our most valuable natural resource &#8212; by leaps and bounds,
    more valuable than all the others combined &#8212; is urban land. Our most
    valuable natural resource is land whose natural fertility is utterly depleted,
    it will yield no gems or minerals; its soil is full of toxins. There's nothing

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: I want to follow-up on what you had said some months ago about land reform:</p>
  <p>JES: &quot;The main, underlying idea of Henry George is the taxation of
    land <em>and other natural resources</em>. At the time, people thought, &quot;<em>not
    really that too</em>,&quot; but what was underlying his ideas is rent associated
    with things that are inelastically supplied, which are land <em>and natural
    resources</em>.
    And using natural resource extraction and using land rents as the basis of
    taxation is an argument that I think makes an awful lot of sense because
    it is a non-distortionary source of income and wealth.</p>
  <p>Q: In <em>Globalization and its Discontents</em>, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the <a href="../docs/Aller_RSF.html">Robert
    Schalkenbach Foundation</a>,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in <em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em>]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land.<strong><font size="+1"> ...</font></strong></p>
  <p><br>
    Q: What are the greatest political obstacles confronting developing countries
      to the extraction of economic &quot;rent&quot; for public purposes? Is
      it simply a matter of &quot;vested interests?&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, it's not very complicated. You know, in the Clinton Administration,
    we tried to reform the disposition of natural resources &#8212; mineral rights &#8212; by
    saying the US Government should not be giving this away to a few wealthy
    people. But the mining interests were adamant in opposing this reform.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Q: In your opinion, would it be more effective to attempt to achieve support
    from economists about the need for such reform, or to bypass them in seeking
    to build popular support independently from them, in that the views of mainstream
    economists on the topic of land reform might fairly be characterized as an &quot;intransigent&quot;?</p>
  <p>JES: There are some economists who are interested in this. I think most
    economists would like the idea, and would support it. But, economists spend
    their time on things that they think have marketability. So it isn't that
    they don't think it's a good idea; they don't think there's any resonance
    in it. President Bush is still talking about the inheritance tax, and income
    tax, and they want to get involved in what other people are talking about.
    It's a social phenomenon, I think. So, if you get a lot of other people talking
    about it, then they'll join the fray.</p>
  <p>Q: You are aware that Henry George was a critic of the moral foundations
    of our economic institutions. What do you think of reform efforts toward
    land value taxation based on an appeal to morality?</p>
  <p>JES: What it fits into is that there is a wide view today that we should
    tax environmental &quot;bads&quot; such as pollution and the like. And switch
    from taxing good things like labor. So, in a way, that's where it comes in:
    let's stop taxing good things like labor, and tax things that are resources.
    So the argument is, &quot;why tax things that are contributing to society?&quot; <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>Q: I wanted to ask your view on the adequacy of land as a tax base. At one
    time, as you know, there was a &quot;Single Tax&quot; movement, for the purpose
    of deriving revenues sufficient to run the government solely from land value
    taxation. In your view, how feasible is that today?</p>
  <p>JES: Most economists would say that you cannot run the US economy on the &quot;Single
    Tax.&quot; In my mind, the &quot;Single Tax&quot; is the wrong way to think
    about it. The question is: &quot;Would it be better if we had more taxation
    of land and natural resource, and more revenue from natural resource management,
    and I would include atmosphere and spectrum.&quot; And less tax on income
    and savings. And I would say, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I think many economists
    would agree with that. So, if you want to sell it as a &quot;Single Tax,&quot; then,
    no, you won't get anyone to agree that there's enough revenue there. If you
    look at is a more &quot;central&quot; tax, then, yes, you will get most economists
    to agree with you. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Q: A former Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation was given a grant
    recently to research the adequacy of land as a tax base. He's a professor
    at the University of California, Riverside, named Mason Gaffney, and he wrote
    a book titled, &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; Are you familiar
    with his work?</p>
  <p>JES: No.</p>
  <p>Q: I'll send you a copy of the book. Basically, he argues that the founders
    of neo-classical economics, which, as you know, is the paradigm taught in
    schools such as the University of Chicago, distorted the science of economics
    to protect vested interests. For example, Rockefeller money was spent to
    hire professors of economics with a view to their discrediting the ideas
    of Henry George. Did that happen?</p>
  <p>JES: My general impression is that most donors that give money to universities
    don't take a very strong view of [who should be on] the faculty. Sometimes
    it ends up on one side, sometimes on the other. It would have been unusual
    [at Chicago], but it could have happened there. What is striking about Chicago
    as a school of economic theory is that it's very conservative. One would
    have thought that Henry George was someone who would have been liked by &quot;Conservatives.&quot;</p>
  <p>Q: In that George wanted to reduce tax on the fruits of one's own labor?</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. And you want non-distortionary taxes, so I would have thought
    that every &quot;Conservative&quot; would be in Henry George's camp. Now,
    as far as I know, I'm one of the few people who keeps emphasizing that you
    ought to view Henry George in a broader way, to include natural resources.
    I didn't think that people thought about that a hundred years ago. But if
    they had, and maybe Rockefeller was smart &#8212; he realized that he obviously
    didn't want a tax on natural resources.</p>
  <p>Q: He wouldn't have wanted rents flowing from natural resources to go to
    the people rather than to him.</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, he obviously wouldn't like that perspective. But I don't know
    if that view was at that time recognized, and I just don't know whether he
    actively intervened at Chicago. <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read

  <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor, especially
      they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything that is not
    fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves.
    The reformers
      in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working more than
    eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love
    to work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit
    to come
      here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came
    from.</p>
  <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
      the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
      of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
      are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria,
      instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the
      swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
      symptoms.</p>
  <p><strong>Land Basic</strong></p>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land
      man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
    must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single tax
    is applied.
      It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax
    does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man
    turned
      from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
      continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
    he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
    there
      were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
      there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the
      surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
      only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was
      complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a
      job.</p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the
      coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it, and cunning men
    know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped the earth;
    and they
      say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages and ages
      to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay
      the tribute I demand&quot;.</p>
  <p><strong>Pirates Demand Tribute</strong></p>
  <p>Nature prepared the earth for ages to make a mine of iron ore, which is
    so useful in civilized life. It was here before man came, and will be here
    after
      he is gone, and yet a plundering, soulless, conscienceless band of pirates,
      called the steel trust, have taken possession of all the iron in America,
    and they say to every man who will use it: &quot;You must pay us tribute.&quot; And
      every time two dollars is paid for their product one dollar goes to labor,
      and one dollar is taken as plunder pure and simple, because of the foolish
      laws of man. They can take from the farmer and laborer all that they earn
    except enough to keep them alive still to toil for the monopolist.</p>
  <p>You may make eight-hour laws, you may make laws regulating sweat shops and
      factories, but<strong> so long as a few rich men own the earth, there will be a few
      rich and many millions of helpless poor. As population becomes more dense,
      the proportion of poor will increase.</strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>... Most of our laws were made by the dead, and the dead have no right to
      legislate for the living. The present generation has no right to bind its
    legislation upon the generation still unborn. When one generation is dead,
    it ought to
      stay dead and not reach out its dead hand to bind the living. We have no
    right to fix terms and conditions for those yet unborn; it is for each generation
      to fix the rules and regulations for itself. The earth should be owned
    by all
      men, the coal mines should belong to the people who live here, so they
    can take what they want while they live, as when they are dead they won't
    need
      coal &#8212; they will be warm enough without it &#8212; and they should
      not have the power to say who shall have it when they are gone. Carnegie
      and Morgan
      cannot use or withhold it much longer, as they will soon be gone &#8212; that
      is one consolation. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
Value Rating</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. <strong>This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The extraction of minerals
requires special treatment under site
value rating, because this activity reduces the value of the heritage
of future generations. For mineral deposits that can be expected to
be fully depleted within a few years, the sensible thing to do is to
auction the right to deplete the resource fully, subject to rules
about restoration of the site when extraction is complete. Future
generations should be compensated by investing the proceeds in such a
way that all generations share equally in the value of the extracted
resource.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For deposits that can be expected
to last a generation or more,
one must be concerned about whether future generations will be
content with the financial arrangements that are made. For these
cases, it is best to have deposits developed by joint public-private
enterprises, where costs are shared in the same proportions as
benefits, so that future generations cannot complain about their
heritage having been sold for a song.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the same way that mineral
extractions reduce the value of land
for future generations, so can the subdivision of land into small
parcels. Once land has been subdivided, it is extremely expensive, if
it is possible at all, to reassemble it for projects that require
large sites. Reassembly, and the economic growth that it permits, can
be facilitated by a "self-assessed property tax." Under such a tax,
each owner of property is required to specify a price at which he or
she would be willing to sell the property, and anyone who wishes can
buy the property at that price. A person who was required to sell
would be permitted to remove anything he or she wished, so that
compulsory sales would be initiated only by persons or public bodies
that wished to redevelop land. The appropriate tax rate would be a
fraction of a per cent per year, so that people would find it
financially feasible to assess their land a prices that would fully
compensate them for being required to relinquish it. ... <a

Global Economic Justice</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons of
development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people think of preventing
grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Resources
that Fluctuate over Time</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The natural opportunities that
have been considered to this point
are ones that, to a first approximation, yield constant returns over
time. A new set of issues arises when this theory of social justice
is applied to resources that yield returns that necessarily vary over
time. Now the issue of intergenerational justice arises along with
that of international justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the issue of
intergenerational justice without the
complication of international concerns. The efficient use of
depletable natural opportunities requires that they be allocated over
time in such a way as to maximize the present value of net revenue
from sales. As economists have long known, this requires that prices
charged for resources that are being depleted rise at the rate of
interest. But this is just efficiency. It says nothing about who
should get the money.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The axiom that all persons have
equal rights to natural
opportunities suggests that when we deplete a resource such as oil,
there are two steps that must be taken to achieve intergenerational
equity. In the first step, when oil is sold we must share the
proceeds over generations in such a way that every person in every
generation can receive a payment of the same real value every year.
To satisfy this obligation when the number of people alive in
different years is not proportional to the amount of oil used in
those years, we need to invest the proceeds of oil sales in a fund
that would make annual payments to all persons of a size that could
be maintained for all generations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This first step provides
intergenerational equity with respect to
oil revenue, but it does nothing about the fact that, if oil is
allocated efficiently over time, later generations will face a higher
price of oil than early generations. To provide equity with respect
to the changing price of access to natural opportunities, there must
be a second step that redistributes money among generations to offset
the changing price.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This second step implicitly
assumes a world with no change in
technology. If an early generation provides later generations with
improved technology, then the later generations are treated justly if
the combination of prices of commodities, technology and money
received from the earlier generation permits them to attain the same
overall level of satisfaction as the earlier generation. This
specification of justice presumes that everyone has the same tastes.
When tastes differ, an improvement in technology that more than
compensates some persons for a greater scarcity of some natural
resources will provide inadequate compensation for others. Such
inequality cannot be avoided. All that can be expected is that those
who use exhaustible resources will, by limiting their use and
providing endowments for future generations, make it possible for the
typical member of every future generation to attain the same level of
well-being as the typical members of the earlier generations of
resource users. Success in such an effort cannot be guaranteed. We
don't know the tastes of future generations. We don't know the rate
at which technology will advance. We don't know the rate at which new
resources will be discovered. Estimates of all these things must be
made to determine the proper rate of resource use and the proper
endowments of future generations. The most that can be asked for is a
good-faith effort to achieve the standard required by justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now consider the international
dimension of intergenerational
equity. What one nation owes to others with respect to
intergenerational equity is compensation for making it more difficult
for the other nations to provide adequately for their future
generations. If all nations are using the same amount of oil per
capita, then no nation can complain about what the others are doing.
But if one nation is using more oil per capita than the others, then
it owes compensation to the others for making it harder for the
others to provide all of their future generations with equal rights
to natural opportunities. If oil is being allocated efficiently and
equitably among generations, the amount of compensation that an
excessively consuming nation owes will be the market value of its
excess oil consumption, valued in terms of the price of oil in the
ground. The same result is obtained if all nations include the
resource value of all oil that they consume, and all other depletable
resources, in the calculation of what they appropriate for themselves
from everyone's common heritage.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of the ways that a nation can
compensate other nations for
disproportionate use of natural opportunities is by creating
technology that other nations can use to compensate their future
generations for scarcer natural resources. If gasoline costs twice as
much but cars are twice as efficient, people are not, on net,
disadvantaged by the higher price of gasoline. This line of reasoning
requires contestable judgements about the value of new technology and
how long it would have taken before someone else would have made the
same discovery. Nevertheless, technological improvements are a valid
form of compensation for resource scarcity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One issue that arises when
technological improvements are used as
compensation is that not all nations place the same value on
technology. If some island nation wishes to maintain a way of life
that does not involve cars, then that nation is not compensated for
an increased scarcity of fish by increased efficiency of car engines.
What compensates a particular nation must reflect the typical
preferences of that nation.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another troublesome issue with
respect to natural opportunities is
that people have different ideas about which creatures are properly
treated simply as resources and which deserve a higher level of
respect. When creatures are non-migratory, the right to control them
can simply go with the land they occupy, and bids for the land will
reflect values with respect to the creatures that occupy the land.
However, with migratory creatures such as whales and songbirds, a
different mechanism must be created to deal with desires to protect.
If nations representing 80% of the world's population want to protect
whales, then they should be able to protect 80% of whales. How such a
rule would be implemented in practice is a problem that I leave for
others to wrestle with.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>What to Do When
Some Nations Fail to Fulfill Their Obligations</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE THEORY that has been developed
incorporates all of the ways
that nations impinge upon one another by their appropriations of
natural opportunities-through their claims to land, natural
resources, the frequency spectrum, and geosynchronous orbits, through
their appropriations of fish in the ocean, through their use of
natural resources that are embedded in goods, through their emissions
of pollutants that cross international borders, including the ones
that produce global warming and ozone depletion, through their
decisions to have population growth rates that differ from the world
average, and in any other way that nations appropriate scarce natural
opportunities. The theory describes what nations must do to fulfill
their obligations to other nations. But how will unwilling nations
be compelled to fulfill their obligations if they do not wish to do
so?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The theory is not designed to
coerce recalcitrant nations. The
theory is designed to describe what must be done by those who wish to
fulfill their obligations. But universal acceptance is not needed
for the theory to work. In the first place, under the theory that
has been presented only some nations have obligations. The others
have claims. Until a careful analysis is done, it is not possible to
specify which nations have the obligations and which have the claims.
But only the nations with obligations need to be persuaded to
fulfill their obligations under the theory, and these are likely to
be predominantly rich nations. Because the magnitudes of transfers
to recipient nations depend on what those nations do, they receive
incentives to economize on their appropriations of natural
opportunities, even if they do not agree with the theory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But suppose that only some of the
nations with net obligations are
willing to honor those obligations. How should these nations respond
to the lack of cooperation by others? </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, they should
compute their obligations as if the resources and populations of the
non-cooperating nations did not exist.</span> All persons have equal
rights to all natural opportunities. If some natural opportunities have
been improperly grabbed by people who refuse to acknowledge their
obligation to share, then those who do recognize their obligation
should understand that they must all claim less.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, the cooperating
nations should do what can reasonably be done to deny acceptability of
excessive claims to natural opportunities. If some nation appropriates
the oil, diamonds or other resources under the ground that it occupies
without regard to the rights of people in other nations, then the
people in the other nations should decline to purchase those resources,
or products made with them. </span>To do so would be to purchase
stolen property. If they have a dire need for the resources, they
should recognize the claims of all persons to the resources by
including the value of the resources in their own calculations of what
they appropriate from everyone's common heritage. In this way, economic
pressure would be put on all resource users to acknowledge the equal
rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What if a nation refuses to share
the value of natural
opportunities among its citizens? A reasonable test of whether a
nation can properly be treated as the agent of its citizens and the
appropriate recipient of its citizens' shares of the value of natural
opportunities is whether the nation allows its citizens to leave. If
a nation does not allow its citizens to leave, then it is not proper
to treat the nation as the agent of its citizens. The citizens are
effectively imprisoned. We have no way of honoring our obligations
to them. We might put their shares in trust, but if they are not
allowed to leave, then we should not trust their government to use
their shares of the value of natural opportunities as they would
wish. On the other hand, if the citizens could leave and decline to
do so, and if there are some other nations that would accept them,
then we are justified in regarding their continued citizenship as
evidence of their implied consent to the decisions of their
government about how their shares of natural opportunities will be
used. This rule may induce governments that would otherwise keep
their citizens captive within their borders to instead allow them
liberty.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus the proper application of a
principle of equal rights of all
persons to natural opportunities will generate incentives for
increased compliance and increased liberty for all. It is not
necessary to have a world government that has the power to coerce all
nations to abide by a single authority's determination of what they
owe. Every nation can make its own determination of what, if
anything, they owe to others. Within broad limits people can accept
differing interpretations of obligations. If some nation exceeds the
limits of tolerance, other nations can reasonably respond by
declining to regard that nation or its citizens as the true owners of
the things they seek to trade. What is created is a diverse,
tolerant, and responsible international community.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not necessary to achieve
universal acceptance of this theory
for it to be effective. What is necessary is acceptance by the major
economic powers, plus a willingness to condition economic relations
on an assurance that traded goods are not unjustly appropriated from
nature, and are not made with the labor of persons who are deprived
of their liberty to migrate if they choose....&nbsp; <a

to Resource Use</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is only a small step from
charging people for street use and
parks to charging them for renewable and exhaustible resources. <b>If
people who could fish as much as they wanted would deplete fish
stocks excessively, then some form of control over fishing is
beneficial. </b>It is possible in theory to have efficient control
through quotas, though it is difficult to set the quotas properly,
and highly contentious to change them when conditions require a
change. <b>The recognition that the fish are everyone's common
heritage would require that, if there are to be quotas, the quotas be
auctioned, and that if not, then everyone who fishes be required to
pay for fishing according to the loss in the value of fish stocks
that results from fishing.</b> If a fishing resource lies entirely
within a single nation (as in a lake or river), then the recipient of
the fees for fishing should be the polity that includes the resources
(Though the value of the fishing resource would be included in the
calculation of whether the nation was using more than its share of
global natural opportunities.) When the fishing resource is in
international waters, the fees should be shared equally among all
nations in proportion to their populations. <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With resources such as oil, which
are depleted over time, new
issues of efficiency and justice arise. Depletable resources ought to
be regarded as part of the heritage to which everyone has equal
rights, though some provision must then be made to provide incentives
for discovery. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equal rights are
expressed by requiring everyone who
uses a depletable resource to pay for the resulting depletion.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Efficiency </span>requires
that a resource that is to be depleted over time
be sold in such a pattern over time as will maximize the present
value of receipts. This generally means using a lot in early years,
then less and less as time goes by, with the price of resources in
the ground rising at the interest rate. If the receipts were spent as
they were received, more would go to early generations than to later
generations. A principle of equal rights to natural opportunities
means that the receipts should be put into a fund, from which equal
payments are made to all persons in all years. Furthermore, later
generations are disadvantaged by the higher price of oil that they
face. A principle of equal rights for all persons would allocate
additional payments to later generations to compensate them for the
higher price of oil they faced, though this could be offset by later
generations having access to technology that earlier generations did
not have. Thus a nation that provides the rest of the world with
technology that eases the task of providing for future generations
should receive a credit for this, although there will be difficulty
in estimating the contribution of any innovation. (If one person had
not discovered something, the chances are that eventually some else
would have.)<b> ... </b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The
Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b>
</small><br>
<small>One of the factors that makes the case for secession difficult
is
the problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the
people who called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria
in the 1960s, the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact
that, if they had succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate
oil resources from the rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the
efforts of the Chechins to separate from Russia is explained in part
by the understanding that, even though the Chechins have been abused
by Russians for centuries and have never fully acceded to their
incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya were allowed to separate from
Russia, that would create a precedent that would make it difficult to
oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely populated Yakutsia
region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds, to insist that
they too have a right to be a separate nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps, a general recognition of
a right of secession will need
to wait for another component of moral evolution: a recognition that
all persons have equal claims on the value of natural opportunities.
If this were recognized, then any nation or region with
disproportionately great natural resources would be seen to have an
obligation to share the value from using those resources with those
parts of the world that have less than average resources per capita.
This would eliminate the desire to appropriate natural resources as a
reason for secession and as a reason for opposing secession. Signs of
a recognition of the equal claims of all persons on the use of
natural opportunities are slim. One can point to John Locke: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>Whether we consider natural Reason, which tells
us, the Men, being once born, have a right to their Preservation, and
consequently to Meat and Drink, and such other things, as Nature
affords for their Subsistence: Or Revelation, which gives us an account
of those Grants God made of the World to Adam, and to Noah, and his
Sons, 'tis very clear, that God, as King David says, Psal. CXV. xvi.
has given the Earth to the Children of Men, given it to Mankind in
common.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke goes on to say that every
person has a right to himself, and
therefore to the things of value that are created by combining his
efforts with natural opportunities, "at least where there is as much
and as good left in common for others." He then argues that with so
much unclaimed land in America, no one can justly complain if all of
Europe is privately appropriated. Locke does not address the question
of how rights to land should be handled if there is no unclaimed
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thomas Jefferson, writing on the
subject of patents, said, But
while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of
property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit
a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by
those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual
has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for
instance.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George said,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The equal right of all
men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the
air--it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence. For we
cannot suppose that some men have the right to be in this world and
others no right. </small>
  <p><small>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator,
we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty--with an equal right to the use of all that nature so
impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable;
it is a right which vests in every human being as he enters the world,
and which during his continuance in the world can be limited only by
the equal rights of others.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>4</i></b></small></font></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>General recognition of the equal
rights of all to the use of land
and other natural opportunities is hard to find. When the powerful
nations of the world got together to eject Iraq from Kuwait, very
little was heard of the bizarreness of supposing that Emir of Kuwait
and his relatives had a right to all the oil that lay under Kuwait.
Some recognition of equal rights to the use of natural opportunities
can be found in the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty, which would have
had all nations benefiting from the granting of franchises to extract
minerals from the sea. From an economic perspective, the treaty was
flawed by the fact that it would have created an artificial scarcity
of seabed mining activities in order to raise revenue, and it was
opposed by the U.S. and not implemented. But it did suggest general
recognition of global equal rights to at least those natural
opportunities that no one has yet begun to use.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One impediment to the recognition
of equal rights to the use of
natural opportunities is that some system of assessment would be
needed to identify the transfers that would compensate for unequal
access to natural opportunities. Another impediment is that a system
of rewards for those who discover new opportunities would be needed.
But if there were a will to address them, these technical
difficulties could be solved adequately, as they are in jurisdictions
such as Alberta, Canada, that claim all mineral rights for the
government....&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html"><span

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The depletion of natural
resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics" ...<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why has land value taxation
(LVT) frequently been omitted from lists of
significant eco-taxes yet, as this paper will argue, LVT can be
enormously influential in its effect on economic and environmental
practices?</small><br>
<br>
<small>One reason lies in the confusion arising from how the very word
"land"
is used imprecisely or in different circumstances such as </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>land with agricultural value, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>(urban) land with largely locational value, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>land as the very soil itself, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>even land in the broad and inclusive sense of meaning
natural resources in general.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even within the discipline of
macroeconomics, there have been three major shifts in the way land has
been regarded, almost in the manner of a magician's sleight of
hand.&nbsp; Scene 1 has the magician display a rabbit in a cage. Scene
2 has the rabbit disappear. Scene 3 has the magician pull the "same"
rabbit out of a hat.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Scene 1 was the era of classical economics, when the 3
factors of
production were labour, capital and land - and here the rabbit
represents land principally in the sense of urban land with locational
value, while other natural resources were accorded little or no value
as they were considered to be drawn from an almost infinite storehouse.
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Scene 2 was the era of neoclassical economics, whose
textbooks
invariably started with a recognition that there were three factors of
production but from then on treated land as simply a type of capital.
Land was simply conflated with capital and the rabbit had disappeared! <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 3 is the era of the
environmental reform of economics, when
the rabbit suddenly reappears in the form of natural resources <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">which
effectively exclude land</span>.</span> "Hang on!" squeals a
freckle-faced boy in the
front row, "that's a different rabbit!"<strong> ...</strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The process of monitoring and
assessing LVT itself leads to a more
subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently,
many natural resources are almost assigned a worthless value because,
not entering the mainstream marketplace, they usually have no $ tags
hanging off them - hence the existence of externalities whereby the
environment is plundered as near worthless.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So
even wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>One way or another, it is necessary to quantify and prioritise
the real
value (in a broad sense) of natural resources to better account for
economic externalities. In the end, only if a prospective resource user
is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising land and other natural
resources will resource extraction or development go ahead. The
intrinsic nature of the LVT assessment process considerably assists in
such cost estimation.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT's foundation of detailed
land use
assessments will also help expose the true costs of subsidies for
natural resources, which effectively amount to negative eco-taxes.</span>
Subsidies come in all shapes and sizes, often barely visible, and
urgently need to be exposed and evaluated. Even some harmful subsidies
which are labeled land taxes have nothing to do with genuine LVT. Banks
gives the example of a Brazilian tax which was levied on unimproved
land but was reduced by up to 90% on land used for crops or pasture.
Forests were classified as unimproved land and were therefore taxed at
the full rate, which induced settlers to chop down the trees to reduce
their tax liability."&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The whole field of eco-taxes cannot be viewed in isolation of
the
fiscal imperatives to raise sufficient public finance, and here we see
another of the virtues of LVT. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If
people were required to pay the rental value of most natural resources
they used (as many, in fact, already do - to private owners) an
adjustment in patterns of consumption would follow. The environmental
goals would be achieved - at the cost of fiscal goals.</span>...&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most of our domestic oil and gas
is now produced from the seabed
under this water wilderness. The property is public domain under
federal BLM administration, but firms bid for leaseholds there under
a system that the majors seem to manipulate to their advantage. Even
so, there are some Federal revenues from both lease payments and
corporate taxes. State and local revenues, however; are nil.

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span

The
property values are huge, and so are the firms that own the
leaseholds. Many firms own tens of millions of acres apiece, areas

Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio
spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell

you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
</span><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Hydrocarbons </span>are a third
set of
valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
nations, including some of your
neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
revenues. Norway pays for a
lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
so valuable that the mere
change in their appraised value in several recent years
has exceeded the entire
GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
production, they may
be the largest in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
there is another side to this.
The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
oil in Russian terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective
way to tax resource
rents.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska holds
down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span>
Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri Lvov from the
Russian Academy of
Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
could cover most of
your national budget from your enormous production of oil
and gas.
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> Many
third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have great
value, too.</span> Many
nations, even backward
ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from
"hardrock" minerals. Bolivia,
Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
Zaire, and Zambia
have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
years; Chile, Thailand
and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.
Saskatchewan, a
Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
uranium; Minnesota, an
American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
nations fail to raise much
revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
like S. Africa with its gold
and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
with its lead mines and
reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life, and the
most valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For
example, in southern California we need water so much we
import it from the
Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
through the long San Joaquin
Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
tunnel it through the
San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
gets here, it
supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the
Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal
to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local
waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus
value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually
subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
that is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
time we learned to husband
and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
surplus. So should you, in
comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span> Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.
British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
Quebec, and other provinces
raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
water. Russia, with some of
the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
same, or better.
</small><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
value.</span> In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell these
licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. <br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</small>...<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like 
</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
</ul>
<small>Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. <br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Avoid letting lessees of public land conceal
their revenues</span>. Many
minerals and hydrocarbons on public lands are leased
by private firms,
subject either to "royalties" or "severance taxes"
based on the value of
output. Many of these private firms are "vertically
integrated," meaning they
own the downstream firms, often in other countries,
to which they sell.
They grow skilled at shifting profits away from where
taxes are higher to
where they are lower, by rigging the internal
transfer prices. That is, they
sell to themselves at artificially low prices, so
your share of their revenues
disappears. What they call "world market" prices are
really their own
internal prices, adjusted to help them steal from
you. You must guard
against that.
</small><br>
<small><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid trying to distribute rents to
consumers by
capping prices
below the market.</span> This, of course, is the history of
energy prices in
Russia; it has also been used, in milder forms, in
Canada and the U.S.
What is wrong with it? In a word, it fosters wasteful
use, and aborts a lot of
economical production. In addition, it leaves a lot
of rent in private hands,
untaxed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is easy to understand the
dire need for guaranteed fuel
in a northern continental
winter climate. You mustn't let people freeze, and they
will bless and support you
for keeping them warm. As society gets better organized,
though, you can gain by
guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
buy fuel and other
needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
free fuel that you might be
exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the
cash income from the
rents created when fuel prices rise, and have a lot more
to spare from the resulting
net gains, which I next explain.</span> ...<br>
<br>
Note, finally, that a cap on the price of G [gross revenues], such as
discussed above, has the same effects as a tax based on G.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since forever, humans have
claimed and counter-claimed every
square inch of this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended
peacefully. What has worked in other times and places might work
again in the Mideast. Delivering a double dividend, what settled land
disputes also developed moribund economies and revived developed
ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has used this
policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp; </span>These
cases involved different classes, not different cultures.
Yet with a new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may
work between societies. The Koran urges landlords to not gouge
tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not
own land forever, since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National
Trust leases all the land to the occupants. These strictures could
lead to geonomics.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel
and Palestine would establish a steward to collect land
dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in
more than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since
Israelis prosper, they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners
developing land, raising its value, fattening everyone's Citizens
Dividend Arabs might accept that. Profit does make for strange
bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan, recently agreed to
explore for oil together. </small></p>

AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of
Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway&sup1;s citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The paper recommends full use
of information and communication
technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
(ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
possible distribution of citizen dividends.</small><br>

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Revenue_Sharing.html">Revenue
Sharing under Land Value Taxation</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proposition that the rental
value of land should be collected by
governments and used for public purposes has a powerful moral
rationale: Since no one made the land, no one can properly claim to own
it. There is a simple efficiency rationale as well: Social collection
of the rental value of land does not interfere with incentives to be
productive. If governments do not collect the rental value of land,
then they will levy taxes that discourage productive activity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When "government" is not a monolith but a collection of entities
with
responsibilities in different geographic and functional areas, these
rationales for land value taxation leave unanswered the question of how
the rental value of land should be allocated among governments. That
question is addressed in this paper.</small>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>An obvious loser is a resource extractor such as
an Oregon timber
harvester (Weyerhauser is the biggest landowner in the state). All the
rent that society now allows them to retain, they'd lose. Perhaps there
is a silver lining to corporate mergers and diversification and
interlocking stock holding; the huge corporations holding resources
would have other profitable lines to turn to.<br>
<br>
An obvious winner, balancing the losses of the extractor, are the
service-providing companies located off the beaten path, like a
neighborhood cafe. After centuries of just getting by, smaller
enterprises would gain by competing on a level playing field. What
they'd gain (that is, retain) is the fruit of their labor. Conversely,
what big business would lose is the commonwealth generated by all.<br>

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
automobile. ...</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public,
governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy.<strong>...</strong></small>  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1. Materials -
  Extraction vs. Recycling </b></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b><i>Rent</i></b>: The light levy on the value of
resources in
the raw, government vitiates that with depletion allowances. Plus,
government accepts under-market bids for leases of publicly owned
pastures and deposits. Getting to keep Rent makes extracting virgin
materials extra remunerative; recycling used materials, wherein Rent
does not even exist, has no such gratis profit. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Taxes</i></b>: The tax on sales complicates
business. One
must do extra bookkeeping or hire an accountant; an easier burden upon
entrenched firms than upon startups, such as a store to sell ap-tech
(the products that consume fewer resources) so every home can be an
eco-home. Being sneakily regressive, the tax nibbles away at would-be
customers' discretionary income. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>License</i></b>: The price of raw materials does not
include all the costs from the loss of habitat, other species, sources
of new medicines, the downwind and downstream costs from tailings, etc,
disadvantaging recyclers. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>: Government logging roads and way
under-market leases favor loggers and miners, not selective harvesters
and recyclers. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Energy -
Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b><i>Rent</i></b>. By taxing, rather than living off
Rent,
governments can afford to lose land to a dam or its value to a nuclear
power plant. Clean energy, on the other hand, would tred lightly on
land values, the proper source of public funds. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on property makes
improvements to
buildings more expensive year after year. Some states do exempt certain
ap-tech improvements, which amounts to a few dollars, but they also
grant tax-free bonds to utilities, which adds up to millions of
dollars. States make up its exemptions by raising tax rates. An
ecologizer may pay no greater property tax for solar panels, but like
everyone else will pay more to higher taxes on sales and income. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of AC electricity does
not
include all the costs from inundated valleys, nuclear radiation, acid
rain, etc., disadvantaging safe power producers. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>. The federal government pays a
billion
dollars a year to oil companies to pump oil back into the ground as a
"strategic reserve" rather than just leave it under Louisiana and
Texas. Cost-plus contracts benefit power utilities, not independent
solar converters. Rents, tax breaks, license, and subsidies total
trillions each year in the US. Destructive subsidies total $1.5
trillion each year worldwide (The Natural Wealth of Nations: Harnessing
the Market for the Environment, 1998, by David Roodman in The
Worldwatch Environmental Alert Series; he also suggests capturing the
windfall rent-jumps in settled areas.) Thus virgin extraction, sprawl,
mechani-chemical agri-business, gasoline car manufacture, and fossil
fuels look like bargains, making recycling, eco-homes, organic
gardening, mass transit, and solar power look expensive. Low prices win
over customers who string along investors. As long as the economy is
rigged against the eco-system, guess which one is going to continue to
go downhill?</small><small>...&nbsp; <a

Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Wetzel_Justice.html">
</a>We all have our own personal interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Similarly, let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in the
natural wealth of the nation. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

But only
recently, with the advent of data availability and increased computer
power, is it possible to demonstrate that Henry George was right: i.e.
that taxing what he called "land" - really meaning all natural capital
and resources rather than labor or human capital - constitutes the best
possible tax design we could have.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If these natural resources are

their use can be rented at rates sufficient to cover the costs of not
only the provision of those services but for all public needs. </span>All
taxes are ultimately shifted through the economy to rest on what
classical economists call land rent in any case, and levying the taxes
directly on rent improves efficiency by eliminating "deadweight loss."
Moreover,<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A Georgist agenda also calls for
the regular auctioning
of mineral extraction rights, fishing rights, and other access to
natural resources in a way that their rent is returned fully and fairly
to the public weal.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
Competitively assessed royalties especially on the extraction of
mineral capital could yield billions of dollars. Alanna Hartzok has
offered compelling
arguments why rent from locational sites should be reserved to finance
the services of local governments, rent from natural resources
identifiable within a nation&#8217;s boundaries should be captured to finance
national governments, and rents of those resources beyond national
borders should be used to finance world governments.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><small> ...</small></span></small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central premise of ecological
economics is a recognition that market
prices do not reflect the value of commodities, particularly the
resources and services of nature. Oscar Wilde first noted&nbsp;that
a cynic was &#8220;a man who knows the price of everything and the value of
nothing.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">83</span></small>
But it is clearly not only cynics who hold such ideas today. The
growing &#8220;commodification&#8221; of all things &#8212; the consequence of a gradual
and inexorable privatization of the whole world and the ever expanding
attempts to include everything which humans touch in a market economy,
where objects and services which lack a market price are thus treated
as free goods &#8212; means either that ultimately everything must be priced
or else that other means must be found by which to identify value. The
subfield of environmental economics is based on just this view &#8212; that
everything must be priced. To be sure, we cannot live without the
natural environment, yet treatment of natural goods and services as
free under the neoclassical economics
framework leads inevitably to their total consumption and destruction.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">84</span></small> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
looming exhaustion of natural resources compels us to recognize that
market prices have limited worth in signaling true value, whether those
resources be the biota of the world upon which human beings also depend
for their existence or mineral wealth in the form of fossil fuel energy
which drives modern economies.</span> If we do try in any way to price
the
goods and services provided by the environment, they are so far beyond
counting that it becomes self-evident that our economic approach must
change.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">85</span></small><strong>
...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The
heart of ecological economics is ecological carrying capacity and
the premise of economic sustainability. Although this term has to some
extent become a mantra and widely abused, its most popular definition
remains that first enunciated by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> "development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">92</span></small>
Principle 3 of the 1992 UNCED Rio Declaration: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"The right to development must be
fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">93</span></small> At
various times scholars have sought to improve upon this definition; one
offered by adherents of the ecological economics school reads as
follows:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. For renewable resources
(fish,
trees, etc.), the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of
regeneration.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2. The rate at which we allow
economic
activity to generate wastes that must be passed into the environment
should not be allowed to exceed the environment&#8217;s ability to absorb
them.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>3. The depletion of nonrenewable
resources (oil, coal, etc.) should not be offset by investment in and
development of renewable substitutes for them.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">94 </span></small></small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all this is the
argument that manufactured capital (i.e.,
that created by human beings), and natural capital (those resources
provided by nature) are not substitutable, as well as the belief that
current practices portend irreversible consequences for the earth&#8217;s
environmental stability. Nor can the various components of natural
capital alone be regarded as interchangeable goods. Natural gas might
in some instances be a substitute energy source for coal, and chicken
an alternative protein source to beef. But fundamentally each element
is to a significant extent unique in nature &#8212; fulfilling its own
special niche in what ecologists call lexicographic uniqueness.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conventional thinkers argue that these two classes of natural
and
man-made capital are mostly substitutable, in what ecological
economists have called &#8220;weak sustainability.&#8221; But the contrary, &#8220;strong
sustainability,&#8221; is at the heart of ecological economics, going even
further than many authors of the Brundtland Commission Report would
have accepted by recognizing the&nbsp;lexicographic
character and place of each and every element of the biota.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">95</span></small> There
is no definitional consensus, however. The Clinton-Gore administration,
for example, established a President&#8217;s Council on Sustainable
Development on June 15, 1993, and adopted the Brundtland Commission&#8217;s
language. But it carefully avoided any detailed definition of what was
meant by sustainability.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">96</span></small>
Subsequent executive orders and press releases have been equally vague
as to what definition of sustainability is being used,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">97 </span></small>and
to this day the matter remains unsettled. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What is waste?</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question has been faced
before. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gifford
Pinchot</span> was a leader
with a magic name in the U.S.A. during the early conservation era. He
answered well for his times and, I submit, for ours too.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"... natural resources must be developed and
preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country which belongs to us all."</small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He did not say just "preserved;"
he said "developed and
preserved." Today I suspect he would say "REdevelop," to get away
from the negative baggage carried by "develop;" I certainly will.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pinchot went on:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"The first principle of conservation is
development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes (he mentions water for power and
transportation) for all the exhaustible natural resources, ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
    <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the
prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
    <small> </small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, like
everyone, but he gives it a new
turn (or, rather, an old turn that many have forgotten). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To him,
WASTE MEANS FAILING TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES</span>. Urban land makes
a
good example. Urban land, economically speaking, is a lot like
falling water, strange as it seems. Economists (who are not all bad)
classify urban land as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing
water because its services perish with time, whether used or not -
and we are trapped in the one-way flow of time. It is an even better
example of a "flow resource" than water itself, because unused water
may have other uses downstream. Even in wasting out through
California's Golden Gate, fresh water repels salinity. The unreaped
harvests of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the
Golden Gate of time like lost loves, and magic moments that passed us
by. The waste of NOT using flow resources is just as real as the
waste of misusing exhaustible resources. Indeed, when we tote up the
transportation costs of disintegrated urban settlement patterns, it
is clear that failure to use good urban land is a major cause of
wasting energy. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html"><span

As you can very clearly see, it now costs couples - or singles - a

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these alternatives lead
to a
high quality lifestyle and undoubtedly are potent factors in separation
and divorce and reliance on drug abuse which, itself, leads to
anti-social - even criminal - behaviour. </span>We also know to our
great regret that these aberrations are becoming increasingly
prevalent. So is there a solution? And if so, what is it? </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In my opinion, there certainly is a solution ... but, seemingly, very
few want to know it. Judging by your article, I think you do. Here it
is:</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage,
"Idle lands cause idle hands" is clearly demonstrated in Australia ...
and elsewhere.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The only possible "winners" in
this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is
now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum
is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays". How big is this periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented - would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded! ... <a

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry
              George. We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the
              great life which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of
              the children of men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who
              makes an outstanding contribution toward revealing the basic principles
              to which human society must adhere if it is to walk in the way which
              leads to freedom. This Henry George did, and in so doing he expressed
              himself with a clarity of thought and diction which has rarely been surpassed. </p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">... Indeed, if we try to envision, in view
      of our present location this afternoon, &quot;The World of Tomorrow,&quot; I
      have no hesitation in saying that if the world of tomorrow is to be a civilized
      world, and
            not a world which has relapsed into barbarism, it can be so only
      by applying the principles of freedom which Henry George taught. The principles
      to
            which I refer are:</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these
              rights may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction
              between what is justly private property because it has relation to individual
              initiative and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public
              property because it is either a part of the natural resources of the
              country, whose value is created by the presence of the community, or
              is founded upon some governmental privilege or franchise.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should
              be abolished as a means of private profit. The substitution of state
              monopoly for private monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores
              the fact that even where a utility is a natural monopoly which must be
              operated in the public interests, it should be operated as a result of
              cooperation between the representatives of labor, capital. and consumers,
              and not by the politicians who control the political state.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created
              and perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish
              monopoly, they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot
              grant the privileges which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences
              by invoking anti-trust laws against them.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed
        all sorts of functions which it cannot with advantage perform, still
        persists in neglecting
                a vital function which it should and can perform &#8212; the
                function of collecting public revenues, as far as possible, from
                those who
                reap the benefits of natural resources. In view of public and
                social needs,
                it is remarkable that no effort has been made by governments
                to reduce the tax burdens on labor and capital, which are engaged
                in increasing
                production, by transferring them to those who restrict production
                by making monopoly privileges special to themselves.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">These monopolistic privileges are of course
      disguised under many different forms, but the task of ascertaining what
      they are, and their true value,

            Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
          Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Environmental Concerns</p>
            <p>What about the relevance of Georgist ideas to current concerns
              with environmental quality and ecological sustainability? Here
              too there is a strong claim to consider. Interest in Georgism has
              been reinvigorated in recent years by the need to develop public
              policies that reflect the nature of land as a finite natural resource.
              From a &#8216;green&#8217; perspective, land tax is a useful tool
              in discouraging the excessive and wasteful use of land. That is,
              the prospect of paying a high rate of land tax can be expected
              to discourage people from purchasing more land than they need directly
              for their own purposes. It accords with the principle that people
              should be taxed according to their use of scarce environmental
              assets.</p>
            <p>This &#8216;ecological take&#8217; on Georgism is particularly
              powerful at a time of intensifying global environmental problems
              and recognition of the need for remedial policy responses. It requires
              creative extension of Georgist principles because the limitation
              of George&#8217;s own analysis in this context is its primary focus
              on land. A range of other natural resources needs to be considered,
              linking up with the broader concerns of modern environmentalists
              such as Herman Daly (see, for example, Daly and Cobb, 1990). Hence,
              land tax should be seen as an adjunct to taxes on the use of other
              scarce environmental assets, including mineral, forestry and fishing
              stocks, and also bandwidth for radio and telecommunications, for
              example (Stilwell, 2002: 316-317). It should also be seen as a
              corollary to other taxes that discourage environmental damage,
              including resource rental taxes, carbon taxes and fuel excises.</p>
            <p>The case for these environmental taxes need not necessarily rest
              on Georgist principles, of course, but Georgism can claim to provide
              a unifying analytical framework. A common feature of &#8216;environmental
              taxes&#8217; is that they are all targeted, like land tax, at reducing
              the scope for profiting from the private appropriation of natural
              resources, and thereby restricting the profligate use of those
              resources.</p>
            <p>A tension remains, reflecting the Georgist orientation towards
              taxes rather than more directly regulatory interventions. Whether
              the use of the price mechanism in this &#8216;environmental fine
              tuning&#8217; is sufficient for dealing with pervasive environment
              threats is a moot point. The nature and severity of environmental
              stresses is such that more directly proscriptive environmental
              policies are commonly needed to protect natural resources. The
              creation and maintenance of national parks, for example, constitutes
              a necessary direct regulation of land-use: the market, even when
              modified by taxes, cannot absolutely guarantee the conservation
              of such crucial assets. In other words, protection of &#8216;natural
              capital&#8217; may commonly require regulation as well as taxation.
