  <p>THE term Labor includes all human exertion in the production of wealth,
    whatever its mode. In common parlance we often speak of brain labor and hand
    labor as though they were entirely distinct kinds of exertion, and labor
    is often spoken of as though it involved only muscular exertion. But in reality
    any form of labor, that is to say, any form of human exertion in the production
    of wealth above that which cattle may be applied to doing, requires the human
    brain as truly as the human hand, and would be impossible without the exercise
    of mental faculties on the part of the laborer. Labor in fact is only physical
    in external form. In its origin it is mental or on strict analysis spiritual. &#8212; <em>The
    Science of Political Economy</em> <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe316.html">unabridged:

    IT seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
    that Christ in becoming the son of a carpenter and Himself working as a carpenter
    showed merely that "there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one's bread
    by labor." To say that is almost like saying that by not robbing people He
    showed that there is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you will consider
    how true in any large view is the classification of all men into working-men,
    beggar-men and thieves, you will see that it was morally impossible that
    Christ during His stay on earth should have been anything else than a working-man,
    since He who came to fulfill the law must by deed as well as word obey God's
    law of labor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
    See how fully and how beautifully Christ's life on earth illustrated this
    law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is appointed
    that all should enter it, He lovingly took what in the natural order is lovingly
    rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation owes to its
    immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, He earned His own subsistence
    by that common labor in which the majority of men must and do earn it. Then
    passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest-sphere of labor. He earned
    His subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual truths, receiving
    its material wages in the love offerings of grateful hearers, and not refusing
    the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet. So, when He chose
    His disciples, He did not go to land-owners or other monopolists who live
    on the labor of others but to common laboring men. And when He called them
    to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral and spiritual
    truths He told them to take, without condescension on the one hand, or sense
    of degradation on the other, the loving return for such labor, saying to
    them that the "laborer is worthy of his hire," thus showing, what we hold,
    that all labor does not consist in what is called manual labor, but that
    whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral, or spiritual fulness
    of life is also a laborer. - <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
    Condition of Labor</a><br />
    <br />
    NOR should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher, the teacher,
    the artist, the poet, the priest, though not engaged in the production of
    wealth, are not only engaged in the production of utilities and satisfactions
    to which the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and diffusing
    knowledge, stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral sense, may greatly
    increase the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread alone.
    He is not an engine, in which so much fuel gives so much power. On a capstan
    bar or a topsail halyard a good song tells like muscle, and a "Marseillaise" or
    a "Battle Hymn of the Republic" counts for bayonets. A hearty laugh, a noble
    thought, a perception of harmony, may add to the power of dealing even with
    material things. <br />
    <br />
    He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate of enjoyable
    wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge or gives to human life higher
    elevation or greater fulness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the words,
    a "producer," a "working-man," a "laborer," and is honestly earning honest
    wages. But he who without doing aught to make mankind richer, wiser, better,
    happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he, no matter by what name of
    honor he may be I called, or how lustily the priests of Mammon may swing
    their censers before him, is in the last analysis but a beggarman or a thief. &#8212; <em>Protection

<blockquote>
  <p>BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable us to say
    with something like scientific precision that this man is rich and that man
    is poor; some line of possession which will enable us truly to distinguish
    between rich and poor in all places and conditions of society; a line of
    the natural mean or normal possession, below which in varying degrees is
    poverty, and above which in varying degrees is wealthiness? It seems to me
    that there must be. And if we stop to think of it, we may see that there
    is. If we set aside for the moment the narrower economic meaning of service,
    by which direct service is conveniently distinguished from the indirect service
    embodied in wealth, we may resolve all the things which directly or indirectly
    satisfy human desire into one term service, just as we resolve fractions
    into a common denominator. Now is there not a natural or normal line of the
    possession or enjoyment of service? Clearly there is. It is that of equality
    between giving and receiving. This is the equilibrium which Confucius expressed
    in the golden word of his teaching that in English we translate into "reciprocity."&nbsp; Naturally
    the services which a member of a human society is entitled to receive from
    other members are the equivalents of those he renders to others. Here is
    the normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what we call poverty
    take their start. He who can command more service than he need render, is
    rich. He is poor, who can command less service than he does render or is
    willing to render: for in our civilization of today we must take note of
    the monstrous fact that men willing to work cannot always find opportunity
    to work. The one has more than he ought to have; the other has less. Rich
    and poor are thus correlatives of each other; the existence of a class of
    rich involves the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse; and abnormal
    luxury on the one side and abnormal want on the other have a relation of
    necessary sequence. To put this relation into terms of morals, the rich are
    the robbers, since they are at least sharers in the proceeds of robbery;
    and the poor are the robbed. This is the reason, I take it, why Christ, Who
    was not really a man of such reckless speech as some Christians deem Him
    to have been, always expressed sympathy with the poor and repugnance of the
    rich. In His philosophy it was better even to be robbed than to rob. In the
    kingdom of right doing which He preached, rich and poor would be impossible,
    because rich and poor in the true sense are the results of wrong-doing. And
    when He said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
    than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven," He simply put in the
    emphatic form of Eastern metaphor a statement of fact as coldly true as the
    statement that two parallel lines can never meet. Injustice cannot live where
    justice rules, and even if the man himself might get through, his riches &#8212; his
    power of compelling service without rendering service &#8212; must of necessity
    be left behind. If there can be no poor in the kingdom of heaven, clearly
    there can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible in this, or in any
    other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty, without at the same time
    abolishing unjust possessions. This is a hard word to the softly amiable
    philanthropists, who, to speak metaphorically, would like to get on the good
    side of God without angering the devil. But it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; <em>The

    <br>
NEAR nineteen hundred years ago, when another civilization was developing monstrous
inequalities, when the masses everywhere were being ground into hopeless slavery,
there arose in a Jewish village an unlearned carpenter, who, scorning the orthodoxies
and ritualisms of the time, preached to laborers and fishermen the gospel of
the Fatherhood of God, of the equality and brotherhood of men, who taught His
disciples to pray for the coming of the kingdom of heaven on earth. The college
professors sneered at Him, the orthodox preachers denounced Him. He was reviled
as a dreamer, as a disturber, as a "communist," and, finally, organized society
took the alarm, and He was crucified between two thieves. But the word went forth,
and, spread by fugitives and slaves, made its way against power and against persecution
till it revolutionized the world, and out of the rotting old civilization brought
the germ of the new. Then the privileged classes rallied again, carved the effigy
of the man of the people in the courts and on the tombs of kings, in His name
consecrated inequality, and wrested His gospel to the defense of social injustice.
But again the same great ideas of a common fatherhood, of a common brotherhood,
of a social state in which none shall be overworked and none shall want, begin
to quicken in common thought. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp04.html">Social
