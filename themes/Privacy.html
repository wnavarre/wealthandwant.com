    any inquisitive state investigators of fraud. Land value taxation also involves
      less invasion of privacy than taxing the whole property, since land value
    assessors
      do not need to enter the property to assess it. They don&#8217;t assess
      the new pipes, the expanded wiring, the renovated kitchen, or the new cottage

    which
      everyone despises, which can be collected in full only from the very scrupulous
      and from the helpless, from trust funds of widows and orphans, or from
    estates which lie naked before the tax gatherer on the records of court;
    a system which
      drives men of property from state to state and town to town in flight from
      the assessor, and well-nigh forces many worthy citizens to practices of
    evasion which must make it hard for them to look into their own mirrors during
    the

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small>Firstly, in a Geonomic
society, the experience of real liberty would
pervade everything. For citizens would not be beholden to the
government to supply it all sorts of financial and personal information
demanded by the tax system. Instead of having to abide by a multitude
of tax requirements, the land you occupy would simply be assessed by
professional assessors. This would only occur once a year, and the
assessors would not even need to step onto your property because it
would only be your land and not the improvements that would be assessed.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BEGONE!</span></small><br>
<small>Gone are the armies of tax accountants, tax lawyers and tax
department
bureaucrats. Gone are the inefficiencies of speculation, the black
economy and its attendant criminal elements. Gone is the pool of
unemployed and the cost of supporting it (much more on this later).
Gone are many of the social problems arising from unemployment,
poverty, despair arising from hopelessness, and resentment resulting
from great inequities of wealth. And because of LVT and other eco-taxes
apply to all of the Global Commons, we'll live on a much healthier
planet - and so will our children.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Instead, in steps an inconceivable prosperity resulting from a
dynamic
economy that encourages productivity, discourages speculation, is not
hampered by high welfare needs, abolishes privilege, and doesn't
undersell our natural environment. It is estimated that a typical
household will have a true disposable income (after all taxes) often
double that of the current system, and that the average business will
earn trading profits after tax/rent considerably greater (refer to the
section "What's in it for me?").&nbsp; <a

Justice In Australia: INTERMEDIATE KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">MONITOR
  THE PLANET, NOT THE PEOPLE!</span></small><br>
  <small>Remember too that LVT eliminates the government surveillance
  over
  people, their activities and their assets. What LVT and other
  conventional eco-taxes does do is to monitor Our One Earth as any
  responsible form of stewardship should, ensuring our scarce natural
  resources are not polluted, wasted, undersold or privately
  misappropriated.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The bottom line of our present economic system is that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not everything which counts (our Earth) can
  be counted (in $ terms), and not everything that can be counted
  ("progress") counts.</span> Presently, it's the market which determines the "worth" of,
  say, our water resources, our genetic integrity or the last remaining habitat
  of
  an endangered species. The only moderating factor to this is the blunt
  instrument of occasional government intervention, when public outcry
  forces it to save what's left of our (and future generations') Global
  Commons.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>But there is a means of determining the worth of all of these
  intangible benefits - patches of the Global Commons which confer
  aesthetic, recreational, life-enhancing, spiritual, climate-preserving,
  biodiversity-saving benefits.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>We all-too-meekly accept being legally robbed of the fruits of
  labour
  and capital, because we have been stooged into believing that there is
  no other way to pay for responsible government expenditure. Having
  established that beachhead, our governments then steadily make further
  inroads into earned income as well as into other human rights. After
  having been dispossessed of our share of the Global Commons, it would
  seem pretty inconsequential to complain about taxation eroding privacy,
  but it's worth looking into.</small><br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WADING THROUGH THE MIRE</span></small><br>
  <small>But just how trifling is the fact that a mass of laws, too many
  and
  complex for anyone to fully get a handle on, forces us to account for
  much of our "personal" activities? Our private lives are open to
  scrutiny following all sorts of disclosure. "But we have to pay our
  taxes," Peabody bleats as he obediently discloses every detail the tax
  system demands of his earnings, assets and investments. "We don't need
  to understand all this tax legislation," the dutiful drone on, "as we
  can simply employ accountants and sometimes tax lawyers to do it for
  us." "It's part of our duty as responsible citizens," Elroy explains as
  he files away his complete audit trails of financial transactions &amp; statements
  required for tax purposes.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>And we have to obey the law, don't we? The Tax Commissioner has
  powers
  of investigation in some circumstances greater than the police - in
  fact he is the law, with masses of legislation to support him and his
  sleuths. But as he's unlikely to kick in our bedroom door in the middle
  of the night, his other low-key invasions of privacy don't get much of
  a mention in the media.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>And now GST dumps on us the onus and cost of collecting it. And
  the
  massive compliance costs of Business Activity Statements alone now
  display all-too-clearly the time and resources spent by taxpayers that
  would otherwise go into production.</small><br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BIG BENEFACTOR, NOT BIG BROTHER</span></small><br>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While humans are being
  closely monitored, natural resources are not - the inverse of Geonomics.</span>
  Only recently have we been getting some laws prohibiting or restricting
  certain types of pollution, but land and other natural resources are
  still being treated as mere commodities liable to being owned outright
  and treated as truly private private property. But natural resources
  don't behave as ordinary commodities, because many of them are scarce
  and some are necessary for human existence. At least we can be thankful
  that sunlight is abundant and renewable, for if it could be limited
  then someone would try to bottle it up and make a fortune on it.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Geonomics does not intrude into people's lives. Unlike the
  current
  assessors of misguided property tax, LVT assessors would never need to
  inspect and assess buildings and improvements, and rarely if ever would
  they need to set foot on the land itself, hence assuring complete
  privacy for most people. But Geonomics would monitor the direct usage
  of natural resources in order to determine the full and fair LVT and
  resource rentals. Usage of this sort obviously should not be kept
  private. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
