<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Crowded! Is it any wonder that people
    are crowded together as they are in this city, when we see other people taking
    up far more land than they can by any possibility use, and holding it for
    enormous prices? Why, what would have happened if, when these doors were
    opened, the first people who came in had claimed all the seats around them,
    and demanded a price of others who afterwards came in by the same equal right?
    Yet that is precisely the way we are treating this continent.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>That is the reason why people are huddled together in tenement houses;
  that is the reason why work is difficult to get; the reason that there seems,
  even in good times, a surplus of labor, and that in those times that we call
  bad, the times of industrial depression, there are all over the country thousands
  and hundreds of thousands of men tramping from place to place, unable to find
  employment.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not work enough! Why, what is work?</span> Productive
  work is simply the application of human labor to land, it is simply the transforming,
  into shapes adapted to gratify human desires, of the raw material that the
  Creator has placed here. Is there not opportunity enough for work in this country?
  Supposing that, when thousands of men are unemployed and there are hard times
  everywhere, we could send a committee up to the high court of heaven to represent
  the misery and the poverty of the people here, consequent on their not being
  able to find employment.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>What answer would we get? "Are your lands all in use? Are your mines
  all worked out? Are there no natural opportunities for the employment of labor?" What
  could we ask the Creator to furnish us with that is not already here in abundance?
  He has given us the globe amply stocked with raw materials for our needs. He
  has given us the power of working up this raw material.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>If there seems scarcity, if there is want, if there are people starving
  in the midst of plenty, is it not simply because what the Creator intended
  for all has been made the property of the few? And in moving against this giant
  wrong, which denies to labor access to the natural opportunities for the employment
  of labor, we move against the cause of poverty. ...&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
      that Christ, in becoming the son of a carpenter and himself working as
      a carpenter, showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing to be ashamed of
      in seeking one&#8217;s bread by labor.&#8221; To say that is almost like
      saying that by not robbing people he showed that there is nothing to be
      ashamed of in honesty. If you will consider how true in any large view
      is <strong>the classification of all men into working-men, beggar-men and
      thieves</strong>,
      you will see that it was morally impossible that Christ during his stay
      on earth should have been anything else than a working-man, since he who
      came to fulfil the law must by deed as well as word obey God&#8217;s law
      of labor.</p>
  <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
      this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is
      appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in the natural
      order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation
      owes to its immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, he earned his own
      subsistence by that common labor in which the majority of men must and do
      earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere
      of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual
      truths, receiving its material wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers,
      and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet.
      So, when he chose his disciples, he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
      who live on the labor of others, but to common laboring-men. And when he
      called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral
      and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without condescension on the
      one hand or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such
      labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus
      showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist in what is called
      manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual,
      moral or spiritual fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* Nor should it be forgotten that the investigator, the
        philosopher, the teacher, the artist, the poet, the priest, though not
        engaged in the
      production of wealth, are not only engaged in the production of utilities
      and satisfactions
        to which the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and
      diffusing knowledge, stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral
      sense, may greatly
        increase the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread
      alone. . . .<strong> He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the
      aggregate of enjoyable
        wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge, or gives to human life
      higher elevation or greater fullness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the
        words, a &#8220;producer,&#8221; a &#8220;working-man,&#8221; a &#8220;laborer,&#8221; and
        is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make
        mankind richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he,
        no matter by what name of honor he may be called, or how lustily the priests
        of Mammon may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but
        a beggar-man or a thief.</strong> &#8212; Protection or Free Trade, pp. 74-75.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
    poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute
    to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
    impious violation of his benevolent intention. In the rudest stage of the
    arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn a living.
    With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be possible for all
    to earn much more. And so, in saying that poverty is no disgrace, you convey
    an unreasonable implication. For poverty ought to be a disgrace, since in
    a condition of social justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives
    or unimposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AN EPIDEMIC of what passes for
charity is sweeping over the land. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet there has been no disaster of
fire or flood, no convulsion of
nature, no destruction by public enemies. The seasons have kept their
order, we have had the former and the latter rain, and the earth has
not refused her increase. Granaries are filled to overflowing, and
commodities, even these we have tried to make dear by tariff, were
never before so cheap.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scarcity that is distressing
and frightening the whole country
is a scarcity of employment.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Yet why is it that men able to work and willing to work cannot
find work?<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What more unnatural than that alms
should be asked, not for the
maimed, the halt and the blind, the helpless widow and the tender
orphan, but for grown men, strong men, skilful men, men able to work
and anxious to work! What more unnatural than that labor -- the
producer of all food, all clothing, all shelter -- should not be
exchangeable for its full equivalent in food, clothing, and shelter;
that while the things it produces have value, labor, the giver of all
value, should seem valueless!&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>or the question of the
unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What that injustice is may be seen
by whoever will really look. We
have only to ask to find.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is no need for
charity; no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone today attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. </span>The common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
speculation in land. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
