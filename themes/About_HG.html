    Today</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As this book was written, the
Industrial Revolution was
transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a
century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort
had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
evaporating.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor
Henry George marveled at the
stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished want
and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
classes from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the
division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
had increased the dependence of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces
beyond their control. The working poor were always, of course, the
most vulnerable in depressions, and last to recover from them.
Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America, and indeed, were
more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. It
was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath
society, but through society. Those who are above the point of
separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down."
This, the "great enigma of our times," was the problem George set out
to solve in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists will recognize his
analysis as a precursor to the
modern marginal productivity theory of functional distribution. His
story is framed in the language of what is today called classical
political economy, though George was careful to avoid inconsistencies
of definition and reasoning which, he showed, had led other
economists astray.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central feature of the British
classical school was the
classification of productive resources into three "factors of
production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
conceived of these in terms of three great social classes (the
workers, the landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the
other hand, identified them as functional categories, distinguished
by the conditions under which the factors are made available for
production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
earnings of the factors of
production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
persistently low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of
increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
give but a bare living?"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds systematically.
First, George explores the
prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
therefore, wages - to recede again.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Moreover, population growth
diminished agricultural productivity
by forcing recourse to inferior soils. Technological advance and
capital accumulation might afford a period of relative prosperity -
but ultimately, increasing applications of labor to a fixed amount of
land could raise output only at a diminishing rate. In short,
immutable laws of nature - the population principle and the law of
diminishing returns to land - were widely believed to explain the
persistence of poverty.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To George, the Malthusian analysis
was abhorrent: It asserted that
no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
rates.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his own analysis, George takes
meticulous care to avoid
inconsistencies of definition and reasoning. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public debate about economic
policy revolves today, as it always
has, around a tension between two fundamental social goals.
Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
efficiency and equity."<strong>&nbsp; ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Most economists deem it their business to evaluate the
efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
distribution is itself wasteful of
wealth.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. ...
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of
privileges and entitlements tends to
cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
may threaten whole civilizations.
<b>George's central contribution was to show that the distinction
between individual property and common property forms a rational
basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
the private.</b>&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>George's insights have wide application to modern
problems.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Modern fiscal and monetary policies have not resolved the
problem
of macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet a <b>half century before Keynes,
George outlined a theory of boom and bust which explained the
underlying instability of the market economy under present fiscal
institutions. ...</b></small><br>
<br>
<small>Many American cities are plagued by the twin problems of urban
decay and suburban sprawl.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Thus, George's synthesis informs a research program of
remarkable
breadth. Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct
paradigm of political economy, one which reconciles the
contradictions between the two competing paradigms dominant in the
world today - the mainstream neoclassical school, which tends to
focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets, and
Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can
and should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical
economics. What is certain is that geoclassical thought bears
crucially on some of the foremost controversies in America and the
world today.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
    Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
    Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Physiocrats.html">physiocrats</a>
of 18th century France: Quesnay, Turgot, Condorcet

George and the Reconstruction of Capitalism</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I like to picture economic
theory as a vast jigsaw puzzle
distributed across two tables, one called Capitalism and the other,
Socialism.</b> But mingled with the genuine pieces of the puzzle are
many false pieces, also distributed across both tables. Most of us
are either perceptively limited to one table, or else we are unable
to distinguish the genuine pieces from the false. But Henry George
knew how to find the right pieces, and, therefore, he was able to put
the puzzle together -- at least in its general outlines. I don't
claim that he was infallible, or that there isn't further work to be
done. Yet if I find a little piece of puzzle missing here or there,
it doesn't shake my confidence in the harmony of the overall pattern
he discerned. It doesn't make me want to sweep the puzzle onto the
floor and start all over again from scratch.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was born in 1839 in
Philadelphia, and died in 1897 in
New York City. It was in the San Francisco of the 1870s that he wrote
his masterwork, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>. For the greater
part of his adult life he had been a working newspaperman, beginning
as an apprentice typesetter and making his way up to the editor's
desk. His was a peculiarly Californian saga. His philosophy was
forged out of his observation of conditions in a burgeoning new
state, where he was able to examine, as in a laboratory, the genesis
and development of social and economic processes. <b><i>Progress and
Poverty</i></b> has been translated into at least 27 languages.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Among books of nonfiction, its
sale was for many decades
exceeded only by the Bible. At Oxford University, in the English
literature department, it is used as a model of the finest prose.</b>
The rest of Henry George's life was one great crusade for social
justice, at the end of which he literally martyred himself by
campaigning for public office against his doctors' urging. In the
midst of the campaign he died, and was spontaneously accorded the
greatest funeral that New York City had ever witnessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His genius has been glowingly
acknowledged by such renowned
figures as philosophers <a href="../HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John Dewey</a> and Mortimer J. Adler, presidents
Woodrow Wilson and Dwight D. Eisenhower, scientists Alfred Russel
Wallace and <a href="quotable_notables.htm">Albert Einstein</a>, essayists John Ruskin and <a href="No_Victims.html">Albert
Jay
Nock</a>, jurists Louis D. Brandeis and <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">Samuel
Seabury</a>, columnists
<a href="../docs/Buckley_HG.html">William F. Buckley</a> and Michael Kinsley, and statesmen <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
Churchill</a> and Sun Yat-sen. These names cover the entire political
spectrum from Conservative to Liberal, yet all of them saw something
of immense value in George's thought. I'll take time to quote from
only one of these testimonials &#8212; the one by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
founder and first president of the <strong>Republic of China</strong>. "I intend," he
declared, "to devote my future to the welfare of the Chinese people.
The teachings of Henry George will be the basis of our program of
reform." I think we may safely say that had Dr. Sun lived to carry
out his promise, the Chinese mainland would not today be Red. But
<b>Taiwan</b>, where it has been carried out, by no means fully but
to a considerable extent, has, as a result, witnessed a spectacular
transformation from abysmal poverty to vibrant prosperity distributed
so as to benefit all levels of the population.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that I'd quote from only
one testimonial, and I'll keep my
word. But I do consider it apposite to mention that Count Tolstoy,
author of <b><i>War and Peace</i></b>, <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>,
and of the explicitly Georgist novel, <b><i>Resurrection</i></b>,
wrote a long letter to Tsar Nicholas II in January, 1902, warning of
mounting public disaffection, and pleading for reform along Georgist
lines as the most immediate measure necessitated both by the demands
of justice and the threat of socialist revolution. It was followed in
May of the same year by a letter to another member of the imperial
family, spelling out the specifics of George's proposal. May one not
reasonably assume that, had Tolstoy's warning and plea been heeded,
Russia would have been spared more than seven decades of Communist
tyranny; its satellite and subject nations, their respective periods
of Marxist domination; and the West, the burden of the Cold War? Or
that, by disregarding that warning and that plea, Nicholas II
forfeited the lives of hapless millions, including, ironically, his
own and those of his cherished wife and children?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For a long time, it was the
fashion among academic economists to
ignore or patronize Henry George -- whether for his lack of formal
credentials, for his propensity to mingle moral arguments with
economic ones, or for other perceived intellectual crimes even more
monstrous. Today, this is becoming less and less the case, although,
of course, there were honorable exceptions from the outset. But now
we find economists of every stripe, including at least four <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">Nobel
laureates</a>, united in agreement that George has much to say that is of
vital contemporary importance. The list is far too long to read in
its entirety, but it includes such names as Gary Becker, Kenneth
Boulding, James Buchanan, <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>, <a

of whom served recently as president of the American Economic
Association.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the preface to the fourth
edition of <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and

<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
    attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
    factor of land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, George was the apostle of the single tax. It aimed most directly
    at land speculators. His insights would focus now on the limitations on the
    use of land imposed by zoning. If John Jones wants an acre protecting his
    house, he is laying claim to something that cannot expand in size. Since
    land, in George's analysis, is forever limited, it must be thought of and
    treated as common property. And therefore the rental value of one acre should
    constitute a tax (the single tax) on the person who sequesters it for himself.</p>
  <p>A strong case can be made for the amenities of zoning laws. But they have
    an effect on the availability of housing, and on its cost. One result is
    that housing costs are increasing faster than inflation.</p>
  <p>But is the Henry George factor likely to be espoused in political platforms?
    It cannot happen soon because too many interests are vested in zoning laws.
    But sharp political eyes should be trained on the question, in search of
    a viable formulation designed to fight against homelessness for grandchildren
    who cannot be expected to pay the projected cost of housing. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read

    Global Economic Justice</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">    </span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was one of the most
famous reformers of the late 19th
century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a>, his ideas have inspired people working for economic and
social reform all around the world. He is most famous for proposing
the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the value of land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">But
I will argue that the single tax on land was not George's most
important contribution, and that the power of his thinking can be
best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social justice that he
used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the first chapter of Book VI of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>, George
analyzes six different proposed remedies for persistent poverty and
explains why they are inadequate. In the second chapter, which
consists of just three pages, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">he asserts that
the only effective
remedy for the relief of poverty and the unacceptable distribution of
wealth is to "make land common property."</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's choice of words here may
have been unnecessarily
inflammatory. When people see this phrase, they generally presume
that George was proposing public ownership of land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In fact he
rejected public ownership of land. What he actually meant was that we
must recognize that land is everyone's common heritage, and we must
develop institutions that reflect this.</span> In any case, he
recognized
that his assertion would sound outrageous to many of his readers, and
he promised to defend it:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>The laws of the universe are harmonious. And if
the remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be
consistent with justice; it must be practical of application; it must
accord with the tendencies of social development and must harmonize
with other reforms. </small>
    <p><small>All this I propose to show.<font size="-2"><small><b>1</b></small></font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Accordingly, Book VII is concerned
with the justice of making land
common property, Book VIII deals with the method and practicality of
making land common property--not by public ownership of land, but by
abolishing other taxes and financing government by public collection
of the rent of land, and Book IX explores economic consequences of
this remedy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The first chapter of Book VII thus
plays the crucial role of
overcoming the reader's inclination toward knee-jerk rejection of
George's startling idea. And George is prepared with a theory of
justice in powerful language:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>What constitutes the rightful basis of property?
What is it that enables a man justly to say of a thing, "It is mine!"
From what springs the sentiment which acknowledges his exclusive right
against all the world? Is it not, primarily, the right of a man to
himself, to the use of his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits
of his own exertions? Is it not this individual right, which springs
from and is testified to by the natural facts of individual
organization--the fact that each particular pair of hands obey a
particular brain and are related to a particular stomach; the fact that
each man is a definite, coherent, independent whole &#8212; which alone
justifies individual ownership? As a man belongs to himself, so his
labor when put in concrete form belongs to him.<font size="-2"><small><b>2</b></small></font></small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George then argues that if
ownership is derived from labor, then
no one can own land, since no one produced it:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>This right of ownership that springs from labor
excludes the possibility of any other right of ownership. If a man be
rightfully entitled to the produce of his own labor, then no one can be
rightfully entitled to the ownership of anything which is not the
produce of his labor, or the labor of someone else from whom the right
has passed to him. If production give to the producer the right to
exclusive possession and enjoyment, there can rightfully be no
exclusive possession and enjoyment of anything not the production of
labor, and the recognition of private property in land is a wrong. . .
. </small>
    <p><small>If we are all here by the equal permission of the
creator, we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty &#8212; with an equal right to the use of all that nature so
impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable;
it is a right which vests in every human being as he enters the world,
and which during his continuance in the world can be limited only by
the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such thing as a fee
simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully make a
grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right
of those who follow them.<font size="-2"><small><b>3</b></small></font></small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
summarize George's rights-based theory of justice: Each person
has an exclusive right to his or her productive powers. </span>We
understand
this intuitively, and on this basis accept the idea that people own
what they produce. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if this is
what ownership means, then no one
can claim to own land, since no one produced it. People do have
rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers, which are
here for our use, but the rights of each person are limited by the
equal rights of all other persons.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A careful analyst might object
that there are some logical gaps in
George's theory of justice. Logically, a right of ownership of things
based on the right of each person to his or her productive powers
does not preclude a right of ownership of natural opportunities on
some other basis. We could mean by ownership only those rights that
are derived from the right of each person to his or her productive
powers, but we could also mean something broader and more
complex.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The easiest way to repair this gap
in George's theory is to
specify that rather than having just one axiom, that each person has
a right to his or her productive powers, he actually has two, the
second one being that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A second logical gap occurs when
George asserts that because
people have rights to their productive powers, they own what they
produce. This would follow only if they also had rights to the
natural opportunities that they appropriate in the process of
production. It is possible that the natural resources component of
what a person produces is more than his share, considering the equal
rights of everyone to all that nature offers. This caveat can be
conceded without jeopardizing the two axioms, that each person has an
exclusive right to his or her productive powers, and all persons have
equal rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This pair of axioms is the logical
starting point of George's
ideas. His proposal for the abolition of all taxes except a tax on
land is a consequence that follows from them. Coercive taxes on the
act of producing or on income from productive effort are unjust
because people have rights to their productive powers. On the other
hand, taxes on the rental value that land would have if it were not
improved are not unjust, since this value is not produced by human
effort. Support of government spending from this source is a
convenient way of giving expression to the equal rights of all to
natural opportunities.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

George 100 Years Later: The Great Reconciler<small>&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></a><small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George (1839-1897) is best
known today for <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a> (1879). Eloquent, timely and challenging, this
book soon became and remains the all-time best-seller on economic
theory and policy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the
world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for
labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These twin plagues arose from
concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation. Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant
exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)
</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George followed his analysis
with a plausible, practicable
remedy: eliminate all taxes except for a tax on land values.</b> The
"single tax," as it later became known, would invigorate the economy
by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available to those
who would use it. And it would suck the air out of speculative
bubbles, damping the boom and bust cycle. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Taxing land is ver</small><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Intro_Kit.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></a><small>y progressive
because land ownership is
highly concentrated among the most wealthy, far more concentrated than
income. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is fair, because the community rather than the
individual landowner creates land values. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is economically efficient, because the owner
cannot avoid a land tax ("shift" it) by choosing less-taxed options. ...</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George toured the world as an
immensely popular political
activist, orator and folk hero. He died suddenly in 1897, while
running a second time for Mayor of New York City. A hundred thousand
mourners marched at his funeral.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the US, "Georgism" melded into
the populist movement, and later
into the Progressive Movement. At the national level, the Progressive
Movement dominated both major political parties for 17 years,
1902-19. At the local level, its influence continued through the
early 1920s. Local property taxation was modified along Georgist
lines: land assessments were raised relative to improvements and
rates were increased substantially. California water districts
financed by land taxes catapulted California to the top-producing
farm state in the Union, using land that had been desert or range.
California generated farm jobs and homes, while other states
destroyed them by allowing well-connected speculators and "robber
barons" to grab large tracts of land. A Georgist, Congressman Warren
Worth Bailey of Pennsylvania, drafted <b>the first Federal personal
income tax law on Georgist lines: falling mainly on very high incomes
from property. ...

<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical
economists give us only a hard choice: we may have
equity, or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program
reconciles equity and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and composes them into
one solution. He cuts the Gordian knot. Like Keynes after him, George
inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter tradeoffs; we can have it
all!"<span style="font-weight: normal;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><a

</a>(in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Corruption of Economics</span>,
London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1994)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, in contrast, had a
genius for
reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling is far better than merely
compromising. He had a way of taking two problems and composing them
into one solution, as we lay out in detail infra. He took two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and synthesized a plan
to combine the better features, and discard the worse features, of
each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
dilemmas and standoffs. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before Keynes
there was another great reconciler, Henry George. In
1879, George electrified the world by identifying a cause of the
boom/slump cycle, identifying a cause of inadequate demand for labor,
and, best of all, following through with a plausible, practicable
remedy. Like Keynes and Laffer after him, he turned people on by
saying "Forget the bitter trade-offs; we can have it all." &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George came out of a raw, naive
new colony, California, as a
scrappy marginal journalist. Yet his ideas exploded through the
sophisticated metropolitan world as though into a vacuum. His book
sales were in the millions. Seven short years after publishing
<a href="../George_P&P.html"><i>Progress and Poverty</i></a> in remote
California he nearly
took over as Mayor of New York City, the financial and intellectual
capital of the nation. He thumped also-ran Theodore Roosevelt, and
lost to the Tammany candidate (Abram S. Hewitt) only by being counted
out (Barker, pp.480-81; Myers, pp.356-58; Miller, p.11). Three more
years and he was a major influence in sophisticated Britain. In 1889,
incredibly, he became "adviser and field-general in land reform
strategy" to the Radical wing of the Liberal Party in Britain, where
he was not even a citizen. "It was inevitable that, when (Joseph)
Chamberlain bowed out, George should become the Radical philosopher"
(Lawrence, pp.105-06). It also happened that when Chamberlain bowed
out, the Radical wing became the Liberal Party. It adopted a land-tax
plank after 1891 (The "famous Newcastle Programme"), and came to
carry George's (muted) policies forward under successive Liberal
Governments of Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, and Lloyd George.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How could a marginal man come out
of nowhere and make such an
impact? The economic gurus of the day, even as today, were in a
scolding mode, blaming unemployment on faulty character traits and
genes, and demanding austerity. They were not intellectually armed to
refute him or befuddle his listeners. He had studied the classical
economists, and used their tools to dissect the system. Neo-classical
economics arose in part to fill the void, to squeeze out such radical
notions, and be sure nothing like the Georgist phenomenon could
recur.&nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, are we not imputing too
much weight to a minor figure? We are told that Georgism withered away
quietly with its founder in 1897.9 That, however, is warped history.
One of the great derelictions of American historians is to have
neglected the single-tax movement, 1901-24. It is also a warped view of
"The Single Tax" as a discrete, millenial change, a quantum leap away
from life as we know it (Gaffney, 1976). Pure Georgism never "took over
whole hog," but no single philosophy ever does. Modified Georgism,
melded into the Progressive Movement, helped run the U.S.A. for 17
years, 1902-19, working through both major political parties.10 At the
local level, it continued on through the early 1920s. Local property
taxation was modified on Georgist lines even as it rose in absolute
terms. The first Federal income tax law was drafted by a Georgist
(Congressman Warren Worth Bailey of Johnstown, Pennsylvania) with
Georgist goals uppermost.11 Real concessions were made: the politicians
heard the voters. Historians of the Populist Party and movement often
note that its ideas succeeded even though the Party failed, because its
ideas were coopted by major parties. Georgism was a strand of American
populism, later wrapped into Progressivism. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Read the whole article</a></small></div>
<br>
Lindy Davies: <a href="../docs/Davies_Soc_Cap_Geoism.html">Socialism,
Capitalism and Geoism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It may seem odd that both
"capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
(Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
universal standard of justice
upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer lies in clarifying
the question of the rightful basis (if
there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Henry George, however, the
principle was clear. The value of
natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
the
community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
go to the
community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character
of
natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
life.</small>

Justice In Australia: INTRODUCTORY KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO
WAS HENRY GEORGE?</span></small><br>
<small>In broadening one's understanding of Geonomics, the newcomer
repeatedly
encounters the name of Henry George. Since George did not discover
Geonomics (but rather rediscovered it quite independently), why is his
name so prominent?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Firstly, George's writings enlarged Geonomics - its details and
full
consequences - far more than any single person before or since.
Secondly, his persuasiveness and sheer character popularised these
reforms enormously, building up a sweeping tide of millions in the late
1800s. Thirdly, George's concepts were clearly a living, integral part
of his being, and his writings are better understood with the
understanding of his peculiar personal surroundings.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A REMARKABLE LIFE</span></small><br>
<small>But there's one more reason - George's remarkable life. The
singular
uniqueness of George's life and training, bizarre as compared to the
biographies of other thinkers, must be grasped by anyone interested in
his ideas. It is certainly unusual for a noted philosopher to have been
a sailor and a printer, a journalist, tramp, worldwide lecturer and
political candidate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the goldfields of California and British Columbia, George had
the
unique opportunity of studying the formation of a civilization - the
change of an encampment into a thriving metropolis. He saw towns of
tents and mud change into fine cities of paved streets and decent
housing, with tramways and buses. And as he saw the appearance of
wealth, he noted the first appearance of real poverty. He saw human
degradation forming as an integral part of the rise of leisure and
prosperity, and he felt compelled to discover the cause of this awful
paradox.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Born in Philadelphia in 1839, George broke away from his
restrictive
family at the earliest opportunity, sailing the world at the age of 16.
His restless and ever-inquisitive nature took him to the west coast
where, after a spell in the goldfields of Canada, he based himself in
San Francisco. From a type-setter he became a newspaper editor, and was
soon churning out fierce condemnations of the social problems of his
day. In particular he became a strong critic of mining interests,
political corruption and land speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE PROSPERITY PARADOX</span></small><br>
<small>But it was a visit to New York which really galvanised his
reformist
resolve, where he was shocked by the co-existence of wealth and
poverty. The result was the book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>
in 1879, which is the all-time bestseller on economics and, in its day,
was the most widely-read English book in the world after the bible. In
a nutshell, his fundamental remedy for poverty was a tax/rental levied
on the value of land exclusive of improvements, and the simultaneous
abolition of all taxes which fall upon industry and thrift.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Despite his growing public profile and his reputation as a
magnetic
public speaker, George never had (or cared for) personal wealth. In
fact, his early years of dire poverty - to the point of starvation for
himself and his young family - were major character-builders. Even
during the height of his much-acclaimed world lecture tours, he never
forgot his roots and what he saw as his calling ....</small><br>
<br>
<small>George ran for mayor of New York in 1886 and was nearly elected.
He
died in 1897 at the height of his second campaign for mayor of New
York. During his lifetime, he became the third most famous man in the
United States, only surpassed in public acclaim by Thomas Edison and
Mark Twain (himself an outspoken supporter of Georgist economics). Leo
Tolstoy's appreciation stressed the logic of George's exposition: "The
chief weapon against the teaching of Henry George was that which is
always used against irrefutable and self-evident truths. This method,
which is still being applied in relation to George, was that of hushing
up."</small><br>
<br>
<small>His ideas stand: he who makes should have; he who saves should
enjoy;
what the community produces belongs to the community for communal uses;
and God's earth, all of it, is the right of the people who inhabit the
earth.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Beyond knowing that Henry George had all the experience he
needed in
terms of poverty, odd-jobbing, writing and publishing, the life of this
man of vision can be read elsewhere. On finding himself out of work in
Philadelphia, he followed the trail of the forty-niners to San
Francisco. Two expeditions in search of gold produced nothing but
hunger and disappointment.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT PARADOX</span></small><br>
<small>For a long time an idea was turning over in his head. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Why are salaries in new countries always higher than in
old ones? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do progress and poverty not only appear together, but
also drift farther and farther apart? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why are public as well as private charity impotent in
solving the problem with any permanence?
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do beggars, tramps and prostitutes cluster around
millionaires' districts?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In San Francisco he had seen the
growth of progress together with
poverty. A trip to New York showed him the process in its full
maturity. The shocking contrast between the most bare-faced opulence
with the most abject squalor turned into an obsession the need to find
an answer to the old question.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But he did not find that answer in New York. He found it in San
Francisco a few months later. During a horse ride in the hills east of
the city he dismounted to let the animal rest. Just to start
conversation he asked a teamster what the value of land was in the
district. "I don't know," answered the man, "but there is a man over
there asking 1000 dollars for an acre." What was happening "over there"
for an acre of land to be worth a fortune in the California of 1869?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The transcontinental railway was about to arrive. The land value
throughout Oakland was being catapulted to the stars with speculators
vying with each other to secure land titles before the arrival of those
who would need land to live and work.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"EUREKA!"</span></small><br>
<small>In a flash, George understood. Land value increases with the
increase
in population, and those who needed land had to pay for the privilege
of using it. But the land is the primary source of all that human
beings need to live. If there is such a thing as a universal right to
life, there must also be a universal right to the Global Commons
necessary for life. He who owns ends up controlling the destiny of him
who works. Words like "republicanism" or "democracy" may be
high-sounding, but empty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The remedy suggests itself. To restore the control of land to
those who
use it, it is enough to take the rent of it as a social charge with
which to defray public expenditure. The rent of land, instead of ending
up in private pockets, would pay for defence, administration and the
social services. Put it another way, let whoever occupies land pay in
proportion to the quantity and quality of value subtracted from the
common resources of nature, not for value added on them by his/her own
exertion. And let all receive the value of those resources in the form
of public services. Nobody would thus be defrauded of the fruits of
their labour, and the load of taxation would cease to fall on
production.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There was nothing new in that
flash of
understanding. He had independently arrived at the conclusions of
feudalism, of Quesnay and of Turgot, without having ever heard of the
three.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HIS WORK</span></small><br>
<small>He began studying and writing. In 1879, at 40, he finished <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>.
The book is still in print, by far outselling all the works of Marx put
together and has been translated into the major world languages.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the 1880s and 1890s Henry George had captivated much of the
English-speaking world with his books and hundreds of public speeches.
The merit of Henry George is therefore not originality but an uncommon
clear argument backed by a polished expression that makes of the book a
classic of both economics and literature. Why is its author then not
better known? Because he championed the efficiency of Land Value
Taxation so well and identified the underlying cause of social
injustice so successfully that he had to be stopped.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And he was stopped, by the so-called neo-classical economists
bankrolled by vested interests.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however, had
advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory &#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Any failure to pay back that increment to society, or of
government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>What distinguished Henry

economics was necessarily a moral science. Unlike those who became the

were transitional figures to what would become neoclassical economics,
the primary focus of George and his disciplines was economic justice.

of such boundless plenty is there such abject poverty? He would

he was struggling to support his young family and establish himself as
a printer, a journalist and a publisher. He could also see before him
the fruits of land and nature easily available to be harvested but for
its legal capture by monopoly titleholders. He wrote of all this in
some six books and countless other essays, the focus always on the
theme of economic justice.... <a

George is his pioneering study of how
cities work and the good they do. Previous economists showed limited

upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
      themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
      they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
      states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
      are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
      claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
      what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
      and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
      In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
      they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
  <p>Instead of addressing ourselves seriously to the task of establishing social
      justice &#8212; the most momentous task which has ever confronted this country
      in all its history &#8212; we have wasted our energies and resources in
      adopting shallow and superficial measures not in harmony with the realities
      of social
      life and which ignore its natural laws; erecting great bureaucracies which
      have attempted to regiment our people, while the mass of regulations which
      they have prescribed have served only to demoralize industry, prevent its
      recovery and obstruct the cooperation between labor, capital and consumer
      which the
      interests of all require.</p>
  <p>As we look at the complications of our social and economic system, no fair-minded
      student can avoid the conclusion that many of the principles which Henry
    George expressed are applicable to it. The philosophy of Henry George is
    so far-reaching
      in its implications that hardly any accurate conception of it can be gathered
      from such brief remarks as are appropriate to an occasion like that which
    brings us together today. It is, therefore, possible to refer to only three
    fundamental
      principles which Henry George enunciated, and which are as vital and important
      in our world of today as they were at the time that he affirmed them. Indeed,
      if we try to envision, in view of our present location this afternoon, &quot;The
      World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world
      of tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed
      into
      barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom which
      Henry George taught. The principles to which I refer are:</p>
  <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these rights
      may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction between
      what is justly private property because it has relation to individual initiative
      and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property because
      it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose value is
      created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some governmental
      privilege or franchise. ... </p>
  <p>The second principle to which I wish to refer is Henry George's advocacy
    of freedom of trade among the nations &#8212; not free trade introduced overnight,
      but freedom of trade as an end toward which the nations should move. ... </p>
  <p>The third great principle which Henry George gave his life to promote was
      the necessity for government, especially in democracies, to free its processes
      from the influence of corruption. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

    the Riddle</a>, excerpt from &quot;Champions of Democracy&quot; - SMOG factor of 7.87
    (reading level of middle school students)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE riddle first challenged him when he was a boy of eighteen. He had a
    job then in a printing house in Philadelphia, where he was born. As the youngest
      typesetter in the house he liked to goad the older men into debates. He
    used
      to stand at the case and raise all sorts of questions in politics, religion,
      travel &#8212; culled from his reading the night before.</p>
  <p>They were talking of hard times one day, and an elderly printer remarked
    that wages were much higher in the United States than anywhere in Europe. &quot;That's
      because the United States is young,&quot; he explained. &quot;When a land
      gets old, like Europe, people find it hard to make a living there. Wages
      sink so
      low. Look at us in America: Wages are higher in California than in New
      York. That's because California is younger.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But why?&quot; asked Henry George. &quot;Why should the age of a country
      affect the pay envelope? Don't the people do the same amount of work whatever
      the age of their country?&quot;</p>
  <p>The elderly printer did not know.</p>
  <p>&quot;The older the country, the richer,&quot; persisted the young man. &quot;I
      should think its wages would be higher.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But they aren't.&quot;</p>
  <p>And that was the riddle that lodged in Henry George's mind. ... <a href="../docs/Cottler_Printer_Riddle.htm">read the

    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985
study &#8220;Who Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    My choice was to explore a tradition of economics and tax policy that
    I had discovered toward the end of my Commission service: the philosophy
    of Henry
      George. In the summer of 1993, I flew to Los Angeles to attend the annual
      conference of the Council of Georgist Organizations; I had become fascinated
      with these, to me, totally new ideas. I have counted myself a Georgist
      ever since. Never in the course of ten years reading and discussion of
      New York's tax policy options did anything even close to this perspective
      cross the horizon. And it is fair to assume that the staffers on the Commission
      today &#8211; it still exists &#8211; have no inkling of what narrow perspective
      they work from. Even with ample evidence that the framework of neoclassical
      economics on which most of the contemporary American tax system rests is
      collapsing, tax professionals have carried on with little awareness of
      its pitfalls. Alternate schools of economics are quickly growing in many
      quarters &#8211; very frequently outside of conventional university economics
      departments. There is even ample evidence now that the still prevailing
      neoclassical economic paradigm can be shown to violate the laws of physics!4
      Professional tax literature, however, shows little evidence of being aware
      of any of this. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Progress and Poverty</em> is the first and only thorough, complete,
    scientific inquiry ever made into the fundamental cause of industrial depressions
    and
      involuntary poverty. The ablest minds of the century attacked and condemned
      it &#8212; Professor Huxley, the Duke of Argyll, Goldwin Smith, Leo XIII,
      Frederic Harrison, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain. Nevertheless, in a
      preface to the
      definitive edition, George said what very few authors of a technical work
      have ever been able to say, that he had not met with a single criticism
      or objection
      that was not fully anticipated and answered in the book itself. For years
      he debated its basic positions with any one who cared to try, and was never
      worsted.</p>
  <p>... Like John Bright, nearly every one credited the &#8220;American inventor&#8221; a
      brand-new discovery in his idea of confiscating economic rent. George did in
      fact come by the idea independently, but others whom he had never heard of
      came by it long before him. Precisely the same proposal had been made in the
      eighteenth century by men whom Mr. Bright might have thought twice about snubbing &#8212; the
      French school known as the Economists, which included Quesnay, Turgot,
      du Pont de Nemours, Mirabeau, le Trosne, Gournay. They even used the term <em>l&#8217;impot
      unique</em>, &#8220;the single tax,&#8221; which George&#8217;s American
      disciples arrived at independently, and which George accepted. The idea
      of confiscating
      rent also occurred to Patrick Edward Dove at almost the same time that
      it occurred to George. It had been broached in England almost a century
      earlier by Thomas
      Spence, and again in Scotland by <a href="../docs/Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">William
      Ogilvie</a>, a professor at Aberdeen. George&#8217;s doctrine of the confiscation
      of social values was also explicitly anticipated by Thomas Paine, in his
      pamphlet called <em>Agrarian Justice</em>.</p>
  <p>George&#8217;s especial merit is not that of original discovery, though his
      discovery was original &#8212; as much so as those of Darwin and Wallace. It
      was simply not new; Turgot had even set forth the principle on which George
      formulated the law of wages, though George did not know that any one had done
      so. George&#8217;s great merit is that of having worked out his discovery
      to its full logical length in a complete system, which none of his predecessors
      did; not only establishing fundamental economics as a true science, but
      also
      discerning and clearly marking out its natural relations with history,
      politics, and ethics. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a><br>
