      <small>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the
      advocates
      of rental and the advocates of private ownership of agricultural land
      is that each position has important strengths as well as important
      weaknesses. This paper argues that there is a third possibility between
      rental and private ownership that retains the strengths of both while
      avoiding the weaknesses of both. The third possibility is private
      possession of land.</small>

          Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
    Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>Now, rent is a natural and just
        thing. For instance, if we in this
        room were to go together to a new country and we were to agree that
        we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we
        divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue
        equality? If it were proposed that we should divide it up into equal
        pieces, there would be in the first place this objection, that in our
        division we would not fully know the character of the land; one man
        would get a more valuable piece than the other. Then as time passed
        the value of different pieces of land would change, and further than
        that if we were once to make a division and then allow full and
        absolute ownership of the land, inequality would come up in the
        succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another man, on
        the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one man
        would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
        little while many of these people would have parted with their land
        to others, so that their children coming after them into the world
        would have no land. The only fair way would be this-- that any man
        among us should be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use
        it, that no one else wanted to use; that where more than one man
        wanted to use the same piece of land, the man who did use it should
        pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being used for the
        benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. That
        would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</small>          </p>
      <p><small>THE problem is how to apply that to an old country. True we are
            confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
            class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Now one
            of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
            some years ago, said <span style="font-weight: bold;">there were only
            two ways of getting the land for
            the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. </span>I
            do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
            that time a most important </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">third way</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">, and that is the way we
            advocate.</span></small></p>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what
      we call the single tax. We
      propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
      that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
      the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone -- not
      upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
      exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
      individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
      the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
      will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
      So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
      called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
      a house.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

      a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a

      Wasteland to Promised land:
      Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because George asserted, "We
      must make land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded
      as an advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was
      nothing of the sort. The expropriation of land makes it practically
      impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
      which are their legitimate property. George's system renders to the
      community what is due to the community, without doing any violence to
      the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive workers.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Common property in land is sometimes discredited by equation
      with what Garrett Hardin calls "The Tragedy of the Commons." Referring
      to the common lands that were a major English institution until the
      mid-nineteenth century, Hardin describes the tendency of individuals,
      each rationally pursuing self-interest, to overgraze, denude, and use
      the commons as a cesspool. That which belongs to everybody in this
      sense is, indeed, in danger of being valued and maintained by nobody.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The enclosure movement ultimately brought an end to this
      ecologically destructive process, but not without literally pushing
      people off the land, exacting a baneful price in human misery that
      might well be termed "The Tragedy of the Enclosures." George hit upon a
      way of securing the benefits of both commons and enclosures, while at
      the same time avoiding their evils. Land value taxation rectifies
      distribution so that all receive wealth in proportion to their
      contribution to its production. This liberates the economic system from
      exploiters who contribute little or nothing. Apportioning the wealth
      pie fairly increases the incentive to increase the size of the pie. The
      market becomes in practice what capitalist theory alleges it to be -- a
      profoundly cooperative process of voluntary exchange of goods and
      services. Paradoxical though it may seem, the only way the individual
      may be assured what properly belongs to him or her is for society to
      take what properly belongs to it: The ideal of Jeffersonian
      individualism requires for its actualization the socialization of rent.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as Marxists err in
      insisting that everything be socialized, extreme capitalists err in
      insisting that everything (even public parks and forests!) be
      privatized. The middle way is to recognize society's claim to what
      nature and society create -- the value of land and its rent -- so that
      working people, including entrepreneurs, may claim their full share of
      what they create. In this balanced approach can be found the authentic
      verities respectively inherent in socialism and individualism. </span><a

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But what we are presented with,
      from Right to Left, is not a
      coordinated structure embodying the best elements from both sides,
      not even a well-thought-out attempt at syncretism, but rather a
      bewildering welter of jerry-built solutions, each one based on
      political and emotional considerations and lacking any functional
      relationship to a unified system of socio-economic truth -- let alone
      any rootage in a grand scheme of teleology or ethics.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A little Socialism here, and a
      little Capitalism there; a concern
      for the public sector here, and a concession to the profit motive

      there - put them all together, and what have you got? Nothing but a
      great big rag-bag, a haphazard pastiche of odds and ends without any
      bones and without any guts!</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nevertheless, there is a Middle
      Way. There is a body of
      socio-economic truth which incorporates the best insights of both
      Capitalism and Socialism. </b>Yet they are not insights that are
      artificially woven together to form a deliberate compromise. Instead,
      they arise naturally, with a kind of inner logic, from the profound
      ethical distinction which is the system's core. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">They arise
      remorselessly from an understanding of the meaning of the

 style="text-decoration: underline;">Most of us
      are either perceptively limited to one table, or else we are unable
      to distinguish the genuine pieces from the false.</span> But Henry
      George
      knew how to find the right pieces, and, therefore, he was able to put
      the puzzle together -- at least in its general outlines. I don't
      claim that he was infallible, or that there isn't further work to be
      done. Yet if I find a little piece of puzzle missing here or there,
      it doesn't shake my confidence in the harmony of the overall pattern
      he discerned. It doesn't make me want to sweep the puzzle onto the
      floor and start all over again from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

    <p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
      Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
    </a></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The justice in the Georgist
      tradition grows out of the premise that one
      is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
      not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
      Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
      inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
      involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
      interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
      world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
      local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
      self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
      state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
      pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
      great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
      solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
      to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
      private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
      exploring commonalities.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>&nbsp;
      Alternatives that have been tried in the past, both classic capitalism
      and socialism, suggest that neither has served the interests of
      humanity well in the long term. Ecological economics has no theory of
      property as such, and Georgism here offers a proven course of
      application. To Georgists, ownership is linked to use and not to
      freehold title. Holding individual property under license of the
      community, and under terms which the community stipulates, is an idea
      with a long tradition, well accepted, and needing only to be revived in
      contemporary political, legal and economic discourse. Combined with the
      pricing device of collecting land rent, ecological economics will have
      a tool by which to circumscribe and even reverse the centrifugal forces
      of a new economic imperialism. This is truly the beginning of a &#8220;Third
      Way&#8221; when other theories seem to be moribund. <a

      <br>
      Dismal trade-offs, deadlocks, and standoffs are just mental blocks
      and smokescreens. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George began
      with a quest for justice in
      sharing the rent surplus. He found that justice and efficiency are
      not at odds, we can have both.</span> This trade-off that many
      economists
      expound is a stall, a put-off to enervate and unman us so we won't do
      anything. It may ease the conscience to think justice must be
      sacrificed for efficiency, and schools starved and libraries closed
      to free up incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done. We all
      feel compassion by nature but, to survive and stay whole in this
      world of beggars and bandits, learn to harden our hearts and cork it
      in. We learn to screen out evidence of suffering and injustice, and
      rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
      is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline, and
      growing division between haves and have-nots. </small>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>What we have shown here is not
      just that
      we can have both justice
      and efficiency, but more, we cannot have either one without the
      other. If we don't share rents efficiently, in the Georgist manner,
      social and political pressures will continue to cause inefficient
      sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></p>
      <p><small>Economic discourse is afflicted with pessimists who firmly
      cling
      to mutually inconsistent positions at the same time, each posing an
      insoluble problem. Some, for example, believe the world is racing to
      starvation, and favor limiting demand through birth control, while in
      another context they deplore "overproduction," or "underconsumption,"
      and favor choking off farm production to keep farmers from losing
      money. George, of course, would see demand as the answer to supply,
      and land as the field on which the twain may meet and satisfy each
      other, leveling them upwards.</small></p>
      <p><small>Again, some favor cheap power and good roads for rural areas,
      regardless of cost, and then favor low-density zoning to keep people
      out. George, of course, would favor infilling to make full use of
      short interior lines at high capacity, and lower cost per
      customer.</small></p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Epilogue: how the
      public demonstrates its preference for resolutions over dismal
      choices</span></div>
    <small><b></b> </small>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is part of George's genius that
      his proposals solve one problem
      by resolving it with another, turning two problems into one solution.
      It is something like tuning up the orchestra for a concert, turning
      dissonance into harmony, and keeping the beat together, turning
      cacaphony into rhythm. It is the mark of good solutions that they
      reconcile and resolve, rather than simply "trade-off."
      <font size="-2"><small><i>1</i> </small></font></small></p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
        <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>1 If you ever immerse
      yourself in
      mathematics deeply enough to find different proofs of the same
      proposition, you recognize the epiphany when it all comes together, and
      everything supports and confirms everything else. Then you know you
      have the right answer. Good ideas and good policies support and
      reinforce each other. </small></font></small></blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is what George means when he
      writes that "the laws of the
      universe are harmonious." That is what Founding Fathers like
      Washington, Jefferson and Franklin meant by a "natural order." Like
      them, George is a deist in spirit, a believer in the consistency of
      the universe. The concept that some things are more "natural" than
      others is not arbitrary. The clue that one has found the "natural" law is that
      it makes forces harmonize and team together instead of clashing, and neutralizing
      each other. <font size="-2"><small><i>2</i></small></font> The principle of
      constructive
      synthesis - a touch of Hegel - is another way of perceiving the value
      of turning cacaphony into harmony.<font size="-2"><small>
      <i>3</i></small></font></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
        <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>2. In this view, the
"natural harmony" is
      recognized by its power to reconcile. Deadlocks and standoffs resolve
      into teamwork, yielding gains at little or no cost. Today, philosophers
      may avoid terms like "natural law." Call it what you will, it is a
      powerful idea and a worthy goal. Fashions and terms change: principles
      endure.</small></font> </small>
          <p><small><font size="-2"><small>3. Richard Noyes recently
      published Now the
      Synthesis. A synthesis is a reconciliation and resolution, a harmonious
      blending of the best of what had appeared (or had been made to appear)
      to be clashing forces between which hard choices must be made. </small></font></small></p>
          </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists today offer us mainly
"trade-offs" and hard choices. For
      every good thing we must give up another, so net gains are just
      marginal. That is the approved posture: it makes one seem
      hard-headed, worldly, and practical. Too much positive thinking
      sounds suspiciously optimistic, and invites rebellious cynical
      muttering that "there ain't no free lunch." It goes back at least to
      Malthus, who offered mankind the hard choice of food vs. sex. That
      sort of thinking is what made people call economics "the dismal
      science."</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A true resolution is much more to
      be desired. To get one good
      thing we get a second one as well. It is remarkable how many "hard
      choices" are turned into benign resolutions in George's program. He
      is a genius at finding the essential harmony of interests now
      concealed beneath confused thinking. Instead of a dismal trade-off,
      there is a "free lunch," or "synergy": the whole is greater than the
      sum of its parts. Such grand resolutions, when possible, deserve to
      be called "true win-win solutions." <font size="-2"><small><i>4
    </i></small></font></small></p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
        <blockquote><small><font size="-2"><small>4. As commonly used today,
"win-win
      solution" is just a euphemism for a trade-off, in which the loser of a
      resource "wins" by getting paid. Often it is worse: the "winnings" of
      one or both parties represent resources stolen from the public domain,
      while concealing the loss to the public.</small></font></small></blockquote>
      <small></small></blockquote>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
      most obvious such true win-win
      solution is putting the
      unemployed to work. </span>Recognizing this truth is no monopoly of
      George:
      Keynesian economists long insisted that there is no social cost in
      putting the unemployed to work. It is a measure of the bankruptcy
      and myopia of many economists today that even those voices are muted,
      and that obvious gain is denied: working is called a "sacrifice of
      leisure," just another trade-off. Unemployment has become
"job-searching." <font size="-2"><small><i>5</i></small></font> It is
      more likely a
      sacrifice of burglary, vandalism, drug-use, jail time, loitering,
      looting, collecting welfare, and sullen misery. Trading such bad
      time for the gratification, pride, on-the-job learning, and moral
      uplift of working is not a trade-off, but a double gain. It is a
      true "free lunch," if you will.&nbsp; </small><small><span

      the irreplaceable motive power of production and progress." Let us
      trumpet this showing with pride, and preach to the world. Let us also
      allow that personal interest can, if badly handled, lead to inhumane
      excesses and abuses. <b>A worthy goal is to combine capitalist drive
      and efficiency with socialist egalitarianism. How? Synthesis does not
      mean some vaguely compromising "middle way," but the best
      constructive combination of workable elements from each way. The
      specific centerpiece of policy proposed here is social collection of
      land rent, coupled with private collection and retention of incomes
      drawn from labor and from creating capital.</b> ... <a

 href="../docs/Davies_Soc_Cap_Geoism.html">Socialism,
    Capitalism and Geoism</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But
      the term "socialism" does mean
      something, and it is often
      identified with the quest for economic justice. The basic assumption
      underlying it is that the market place, under conditions of pure
      laissez-faire competition, is incapable of securing to society an
      equitable distribution of wealth.</span> Socialists assert that if the
      market
      is left alone to decide who is to get how much of the world's goods,
      the result is a division of society into classes and the emergence of a
      struggle between the exploiting class and the enslaved working class.
      Competition becomes "cutthroat competition", fostering trusts, cartels
      and monopolies. Instead of making earnings proportional to service
      rendered, the market place gives the highest rewards to the most
      unscrupulous exploiters.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">However, many are proud to
      rally
      behind the banner of "capitalism".
      They contend that free competition makes the fullest possible use of
      the gifts of nature and human ingenuity. When the admirable equilibrium
      of the market is upset by do-gooders trying to secure their idea of
      fairness, the result is unemployment, stagnation and corruption.</span></small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capitalists and socialists may
      appear
      to disagree about everything --
      but on one crucial point of political economy their views are uncannily
      similar.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both tend to
      lump land and capital under the single heading of
"capital," and many even include money as capital. </span>This
      confusion
      prevents socialists from seeing the possibility of a beneficial free
      market without the element of monopoly. And it prevents capitalists
      from seeing the fundamental role of the public sector in a just and
      prosperous market economy.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      It may seem odd that both "capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
      justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
      (Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
      a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
      universal standard of justice
      upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer lies in clarifying
      the
      question of the rightful basis (if
      there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
      free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
      community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
      self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
      environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
      regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
      social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
      enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
      of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
      private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
      lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
      denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Henry George, however, the
      principle was clear. The value of
      natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
      production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
      unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
      question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
      the
      community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
      go to the
      community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character of
      natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
      coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
      rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
      life</small>

        Economics as a Strategem Against Henry George</a></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, in contrast, had a genius
          for reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling is far better than merely compromising.
          He had a way of taking two problems and composing them into one solution,
          as we lay out in detail infra. He took two polar philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>,
          and synthesized a plan to combine the better features, and discard the worse
          features, of each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
          dilemmas and standoffs.</small> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As policy-makers, neo-classical economists
          present us with "choices" that are too often hard dilemmas. They are in the
          tradition of Parson Malthus, who preached to the poor that they must choose
          between sex or food. That was getting right down to grim basics, and is the
          origin of a well-earned epithet, "the dismal science." Most modern neo-classicals
          are more subtle (although the fascist wing of the otherwise admirable ecology
          movement gets progressively less so). Here are some dismal dilemmas that
          neo-classicals pose for us today. For efficiency we must sacrifice equity;
          to attract business we must lower taxes so much as to shut the libraries
          and starve the schools; to prevent inflation we must keep an army of unfortunates
          unemployed; to make jobs we must chew up land and pollute the world; to motivate
          workers we must have unequal wealth; to raise productivity we must fire people;
          and so on.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The neo-classical approach is the "trade-off." A
          trade-off is a compromise. That has a ring of reasonableness to it, but it
          presumes a zero-sum condition. At the level of public policy, such "trade-offs" turn
          into paralyzing stand-offs, where no one gets nearly what he wants, or could
          get. It overlooks the possibility of a <span style="font-style: italic;">reconciliation</span>,
          or synthesis, instead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In such a resolution,
          we are not limited by trade-offs between fixed A and B: we get more of both.&nbsp; </span></small><small>...&nbsp;</small></div>

            economies of scale, whose power he acknowledged and even overestimated.
            He proposed doing so through the tax system, by focusing taxes on
            the economic rent of land. This would compensate the dispossessed

      knot of modern dilemma-bound
      economics by raising demand, raising supply, raising incentives,
      improving equity, freeing up the market, supporting government,
      fostering capital formation, and paying public debts, all in one simple
    stroke. It's quite a stroke, enough to leave one breathless.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In practice, landowners
      faced
      with high land taxes often choose
      another, even better, course than hiring more workers: they sell the

      entrepreneurs. This writer has documented a strong relationship between
      high property tax rates, deconcentration of farmland, and intensity of
