</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
  of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If poverty is appointed by the power which
    is above us all, then it is no crime; but if poverty is unnecessary, then
    it is a crime for which society is responsible and for which society must
    suffer. I hold, and I think no one who looks at the facts can fail to see,
    that poverty is utterly unnecessary. It is not by the decree of the Almighty,
    but it is because of our own injustice, our own selfishness, our own ignorance,
    that this scourge, worse than any pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing
    want and suffering and degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies. Look
    over the world, in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation. In every
    civilised country under the sun you will find men and women whose condition
    is worse than that of the savage: men and women and little children with
    whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange. Even in this new city
    of yours with virgin soil around you, you have had this winter to institute
    a relief society. Your roads have been filled with tramps, fifteen, I am
    told, at one time taking shelter in a round-house here. As here, so everywhere;
    and poverty is deepest where wealth most abounds.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>What more unnatural than this? There is nothing in nature like this
  poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see one species
  destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not feed on their own
  kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying plenty, all creatures of that
  kind share it. No man, I think, ever saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few
  were fat and the great majority lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of
  which two or three were swimming in grease and the others all skin and bone.
  Nor in savage life is there anything like the poverty that festers in our civilisation.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>In a rude state of society there are seasons of want, seasons when people
  starve; but they are seasons when the earth has refused to yield her increase,
  when the rain has not fallen from the heavens, or when the land has been swept
  by some foe &#8211; not when there is plenty. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">And yet the peculiar
  characteristic of this modern poverty of ours is that it is deepest where wealth
  most abounds.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Why, today, while over the civilised world there is so much distress,
  so much want, what is the cry that goes up? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is the current explanation of the hard times?
  Overproduction! </span>There are so many clothes that men must go ragged, so
  much coal that in the bitter winters people have to shiver, such over-filled
  granaries that people actually die by starvation! Want due to over-production!
  Was a greater absurdity ever uttered? How can there be over-production till
all have enough? It is not over-production; it is unjust distribution.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We talk about over-production. How can
    there be such a thing as over-production while people want? All these things
    that are said to be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they
    not get them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
    them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to buy
    them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to work for
    an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great quantities of goods
    cannot be sold. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now why is it that men have to work for
    such low wages? Because if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty
    of unemployed men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
    men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the point
    of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment?
    Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment?
    Adam had no difficulty in finding employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe;
    the finding of employment was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer, why cannot
    they employ themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element
    on which human labour can alone be exerted. Men are compelled to compete
    with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been robbed
    of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because they cannot
    find a piece of God's world on which to work without paving some other human
    creature for the privilege. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>In the Old Testament we are told
      that when the Israelites journeyed through the desert, they were hungered,
      and
    that God sent manna down out of the heavens. There was enough for all of
    them, and they all took it and were relieved. But supposing that desert had
    been held as private property, as the soil of Great Britain is held, as the
    soil even of our new States is being held; suppose that one of the Israelites
    had a square mile, and another one had twenty square miles, and another one
    had a hundred square miles, and the great majority of the Israelites did
    not have enough to set the soles of their feet upon, which they could call
    their own &#8212; what would become of the manna? </strong>What good would it have
    done to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had sent down manna enough for
    all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders; they would
    have employed some of she others perhaps, to gather it up into heaps for
    them, and would have sold it to their hungry brethren. Consider it; this
    purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until the majority of Israelites
    had given all they had, even to the clothes off their backs. What then? Then
    they would not have had anything left to buy manna with, and the consequences
    would have been that while they went hungry the manna would have lain in
    great heaps, and the landowners would have been complaining of the over-production
    of manna. There would have been a great harvest of manna and hungry people,
    just precisely the phenomenon that we see today.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a lower
  depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the evils of land
  monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not take you to Skye or
  Kintire &#8212; I would take you to Dublin or Glasgow or London. There is something
  worse than physical deprivation, something worse than starvation; and that
  is the degradation of the mind, the death of the soul. That is what you will
  find in those cities.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now, what is the cause of that? Why, it is plainly to be seen; the people
  driven off the land in the country are driven into the slums of the cities.
  For every man that is driven off the land the demand for the produce of the
  workmen of the cities is lessened; and the man himself with his wife and children,
  is forced among those workmen to compete upon any terms for a bare living and
  force wages down. Get work he must or starve &#8212; get work he must or do
  that which those people, so long as they maintain their manly feelings, dread
  more than death, go to the alms-houses. That is the reason, here as in Great
  Britain, that the cities are overcrowded. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open
  the land that is locked up, that is held by dogs in the manger, who will not
  use it themselves and will not allow anybody else to use it, and you would
  see no more of tramps and hear no more of over-production. </span>... <a

    which the universe sprang into being there should glow in the sun a greater
    power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade
    of grass that now grows two should spring up, and the seed that now increases
    fifty-fold should increase a hundredfold! Would poverty be abated or want
    relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would accrue would be but temporary.
    The new powers streaming through the material universe could be utilized
    only through land. And land, being private property, the classes that now
    monopolize the bounty of the Creator would monopolize all the new bounty.
    Land owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase, but wages would

<blockquote>
  <p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
    on every side may be easily seen. The effect of all inventions and improvements
    that increase productive power, that save waste and economize effort, is
    to lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save labor,
    so that we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements. Now,
    in a natural state of society where the rights of all to the use of the earth
    are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to the very utmost that
    can be imagined without lessening the demand for men, since in such natural
    conditions the demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life and the
    strong instincts that the Creator has implanted in the human breast. But
    in that unnatural state of society where the masses of men are disinherited
    of all but the power to labor when opportunity to labor is given them by
    others, there the demand for them becomes simply the demand for their services
    by those who hold this opportunity, and man himself becomes a commodity.
    Hence, although the natural effect of labor-saving improvement is to increase
    wages, yet in the unnatural condition which private ownership of the land
    begets, the effect, even of such moral improvements as the disbandment of
    armies and the saving of the labor that vice entails, is, by lessening the
    commercial demand, to lower wages and reduce mere laborers to starvation
    or pauperism. If labor-saving inventions and improvements could be carried
    to the very abolition of the necessity for labor, what would be the result?
    Would it not be that landowners could then get all the wealth that the land
    was capable of producing, and would have no need at all for laborers, who
    must then either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
  <p><strong>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long as some
    men are treated as owners of the earth and other men can live on it only
    by their sufferance &#8212; human wisdom can devise no means by which the
    evils of our present condition may be avoided.</strong></p>
  <p>Nor yet could the wisdom of God.</p>
  <p>By the light of that right reason of which St. Thomas speaks we may see
    that even he, the Almighty, so long as his laws remain what they are, could
    do nothing to prevent poverty and starvation while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>How could he? <strong>Should he infuse new vigor into the sunlight, new
      virtue into the air, new fertility into the soil, would not all this new
      bounty go to
    the owners of the land, and work not benefit, but rather injury, to mere
    laborers? Should he open the minds of men to the possibilities of new substances,
    new adjustments, new powers, could this do any more to relieve poverty than
    steam, electricity and all the numberless discoveries and inventions of our
    time have done? Or, if he were to send down from the heavens above or cause
    to gush up from the subterranean depths, food, clothing, all the things that
    satisfy man&#8217;s material desires, to whom under our laws would all these
    belong? So far from benefiting man, would not this increase and extension
    of his bounty prove but a curse, enabling the privileged class more riotously
    to roll in wealth, and bringing the disinherited class to more wide-spread
    starvation or pauperism?</strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q19. In your lecture you tell of a meteorite which a poor man found, but
    which the law gave to the owner of the land on which it fell. (See note 100.)
    Wouldn't the owner, or possessor, or whatever you choose to call him, of
    that land get the meteorite just the same if the single tax were in force?</em><br>
    A. Yes, if only one meteorite fell upon his land. But if meteorites got into
    the habit of falling there the land would grow in value, and then the single
    tax would operate to take the value of those meteorites for common use, less
    the labor expended upon them, the value of which would go to the laborer.
    I told of the one meteorite to illustrate a principle. But as a practical
    question we need deal only with land upon which, speaking in metaphor, meteorites
    have a habit of falling. The occasional diamond, the nugget of gold, or other
    valuable thing found here or there as one of the accidents of a day, are
    of no practical moment; it is the diamond fields, the gold mines, the fertile
    farming spots, the centers of trade, and similar valuable opportunities for
    labor, that are of moment as factors in social problems. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
