<blockquote>
  <p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is
    not long since the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly
    respectable business, affording as legitimate an opening for the
    investment of capital and the display of enterprise as any other. The
    proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous, then
    as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very
    Constitution bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law
    of the nation, adopted twelve years after the enunciation of the
    Declaration of Independence, declare that for twenty years the
    slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted? Such dominion had
    the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who had already
    proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness!

    Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Constitutions must be amendable, to allow
    for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into them. This impinges
    on the protection of expectations, including those regarded as property.
    Protection of property rights is achieved by constitutional restrictions
    on the ability of voters and legislators to reduce the value of property
    by regulation, taxation or expropriation. But such restrictions also prevent
    voters and legislatures from reflecting new moral insights in legislation,
    if those insights would reduce the value of property. There have been times
    in the past when moral development has compelled societies to change laws
    in ways that reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery).
    We cannot guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
    that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the value
    of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the possibility of such
    moral advances, we should design constitutions that permit amendments to
    reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting legislators (or voters in referenda)
    from passing laws that redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by
    the constitution.</small></div>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_PEME.html">The Political Economy of Moral
    Evolution</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A very significant step in the incorporation of a newly discovered moral truth
    into our social order is its embodiment into our constitution. Mere legislation
    does not suffice to certify a moral truth, for a reason articulated by Bruce
    Ackerman in an exegesis of the views expressed by James Madison in Federalist
    10<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font>. We understand that citizens have
    too many other interests in life to attend to all the political issues that
    arise. Therefore everyday politics is bound to be dominated by a few people
    pursuing narrow interests. In the constitution-writing process, on the other
    hand, the level of involvement is sufficiently extensive and the level of consensus
    required sufficiently great to permit those who succeed in having their views
    incorporated into the constitution to say that they speak for the whole nation.
    What is crucial, according to Madison, is not that the letter of established
    constitutional procedures be followed, but rather that the society be widely
    involved in discussions about what is done. This was Madison's reason for arguing
    that the constitution written in 1787 could be valid despite the fact that
    the group who wrote it was not supposed to be writing a constitution. Ackerman
    argues that the same reasoning applies to the seemingly defective procedures
    by which the post-Civil War constitutional amendments were forced through,
    and to the revision of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution
    in the 1930's, under Franklin Roosevelt's threat of court-packing. The standard
    constitutional amendment process, of course, is designed to entail the levels
    of involvement and consensus that permit the advocates of a successful amendment
  to speak for the nation.</p>
  <p>While the constitutional process succeeds in achieving a substantial consensus
    about moral truths, it is not a perfect process. Our constitutional reversal
    with respect to the prohibition of alcohol is proof, if one were needed, that
    not every idea incorporated into the constitution is an advance. The real truth
    of any idea comes not from the fact that it is incorporated into a constitution,
    but rather from the consensus that supports it. And in the process by which
    a constitution evolves, there are often substantial groups that feel extremely
    ill-treated. These groups can attack the justice of any constitutional outcome
    on the ground that those who favor the successful outcome are judging their
    own cause. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_PEME.html">read the whole article</a></p>
