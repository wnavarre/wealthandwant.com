  rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to provide a better view for
  some.&nbsp; Tax Reform means getting out of that small box, to genuine

<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from
less.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html"><big><big><small><small><span

&nbsp;There are many more possible tax types we might consider, taxes

payroll tax is an example.</span></small> <small>This tax would
discourage the use of labor on land, but not the use of capital, and so
would have two biases: less labor use, with the same capital use, or
even more capital use as capital substitutes for labor. We do not here
pursue all such possibilities of bad tax policy, for they are too
numerous. The major point is that taxes on any base other than N, the
Net Product of land, bias the market against the best and fullest use
of land.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong>
<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Taxing the Net Product of
Land Permits Untaxing Labor</b></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The IMF and its allies advise
you to impose heavy taxes on the payrolls of labor, and on employers
who hire labor, and on the goods labor must buy to survive and support
families. </span>Then they turn around and tell you that
labor-intensive operations, like some of your coal mines, are
inefficient because labor is so costly, even though the workers are
getting very little after taxes. They advise you to downsize or close
these operations, throwing labor out of work. They even lend you money
for the purpose: not to develop and build up Russia, but to dismantle
its industry, which they call "restructuring," and throw its workers
onto welfare. In a few specific cases they may be right, but in
general, this is a strange way to develop Russia's economy and living
standards!<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It is enough to
make one wonder whose welfare they have in mind. </span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>To restructure your industry, first uplift incentives to build
and man new plants; then let managers close old ones by their own free
individual choice, as their workers leave for better jobs. We see from
Table 1, and the analysis following it, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">a tax on labor
artificially discourages labor-using land uses like A, in favor of
labor-sparing uses like B, or even D, which uses no labor at all.</span>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If, on the other hand, you untax labor, you lower its cost
to employers. When you change the tax system to relieve labor, many
lands will be shifted to the more intensive uses, soaking up your
surplus labor and "restructuring" your industries in the most
constructive, efficient ways. Employers will want to upsize, not
downsize. Workers will move off welfare and produce more goods either
for export, or for your own consumers, lowering your need to import.
Both of those will strengthen the ruble: production is the key, in
either case. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">You
will also collect more taxes, as shown, by shifting the tax base to the
Net Product of land. </span>Lower welfare costs, coupled with higher
tax collections, will balance your budget and lead to the day when you
can even run a surplus. With these new surplus funds you can pay off
old debts, if you choose to. I take no position and offer no advice on
whether you should pay off old debts from the Soviet era: that is a
judgment call for you to make, based on your evaluation of the history
of those debts, and how obligated you feel. I do know, though, that if
you have good public revenues for the future, you will have good
credit, regardless of the past. Lenders will seek you out, eager to
become your creditors again. That is the clear lesson of U.S. history.
We have had two centuries of experience in which many of our states and
cities repudiated debts, many of them owed to foreigners, only to
borrow from them again within a few years. </small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">Read the whole article</a><br>

Mason Gaffney: <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_PTiaPT.html">The Property Tax
is a Progressive Tax<br>
</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The central
question is, why
rank by income at all -- any concept of income?</span> When we do that
we
accept income-fundamentalism, a kind of philosophical imperialism
where Adjusted Gross Income on Form 1040 is the basic reference datum
against which to measure and judge everything. "Similar
circumstances" mean similar AGI, and similar circumstances deserve
similar taxes. In effect this means we judge the property tax on the
basis of how closely it resembles the income tax, in every detail.
Since nothing resembles the income tax so much as the income tax, the
property tax looks inferior.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, the concept called
"income-elasticity of demand for wealth"
contains implicit income - Chauvinism. It implies one-way causation:
income causes wealth. But wealth also causes income, and as Klein
points out that changes the rules for relating them.88 No longer can
income be the simple ranking variable.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the property tax had no
rationale of its own we would be forced
to accept income fundamentalism. But if the property tax has a
rationale, then it is legitimate to rank by wealth, and fault the
income tax for failing to tax large properties adequately. Here is
an outline rationale for the property tax.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
"Ability-to-pay" derives from wealth as well as current income. </span>James
Tobin, Arnold Zellner, Taylor and Houthakker, Harold Somers,
and others have stressed this lately. The old cliche that "taxes are
paid out of income" is as empty as the one that we consume "out of
income." We spend money, and it is not labelled.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.
The property tax asserts a public equity in land which was won
and is defended by joint efforts, and whose value derives from public
works and spillovers, not from the owners' efforts.</span> It exempts
human
effort, thus rewarding service to the community and denying the state
any equity in the bodies of its citizens whose freedom and dignity is
thus enhanced in their capacity as human beings, as distinct from
owners of wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.
Property taxes reduce the differential effect of inherited
wealth on the current generation.</span> They strike directly at
concentration of economic and other power based on wealth, promoting
competition and equal opportunity. Property as collateral is a
source of invisible income (credit rating). Taxing property reduces
the differential advantage of the rich in credit rationing.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.
Property income of a given dollar value places the receiver on
a higher welfare plane than labor income, because he needn't work for
it.</span> $10,000 a year received by dint of working long hours in a
coal
mine with black lung disease is not the same as $10,000 plus a life
of ease.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.
  The property tax is needed to plug loopholes in the income tax,
  which is inexorably devolving into a payroll tax.</span></small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>If one finds that rationale
  compelling, then the proper approach
  is to rank by wealth.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
  <p><small><b>On Defining
Income and Wealth</b></small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dick Netzer, like others, uses AGI
as the reference standard
against which to match the property tax and find it
regressive.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(40)</i></b></small></font> A
certain
citizen in 1970 reported no AGI, but heavy property taxes, which
might make the property tax quite regressive were it not Ronald
Reagan. Yet he is not alone, and it seems harsh to select a measure
that makes the property tax regressive because it is the only tax
many rich men pay. General Oppenheimer has written a fine set of
manuals on how to reach Zero AGI by losing money
farming,<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(41)</i></b></small></font> and
they work so
well that taxable farm income is down to about $3 billions while the
USDA estimates farm income at $14
billions.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(42)</i></b></small></font> I do
not think
that AGI will do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just farming. Property
is the paramount tax shelter. How does it cover thee? Let me count the
ways. There is </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>expensing of intangibles and soil and water conservation, </small></li>
  <li><small>percentage depletion, </small></li>
  <li><small>capital gains rates, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferred realization, </small></li>
  <li><small>non-distribution of profits, </small></li>
  <li><small>nonrealization, </small></li>
  <li><small>conversion of interest into cost recovery by watered sales
prices, </small></li>
  <li><small>accelerated depreciation, </small></li>
  <li><small>multiple depreciation, </small></li>
  <li><small>de facto expensing of capital improvements, </small></li>
  <li><small>deduction of interest, </small></li>
  <li><small>covert write-off of undepreciated land value, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferral of tax beyond date of sale, and many others.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same time, property is a
large source of income that is not
counted in AGI. Unrealized accruals and imputed income are the most
obvious, and each is a huge item.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus the ownership of property
tends on a large scale to reduce
AGI and increase real income. When we rank by AGI, property owners
move into lower brackets than they belong; non-owners move into
higher brackets.</b> Property tax payments move into the lower
brackets, pre-ordaining a finding of regressivity which is totally
illusory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At least two studies have sought
to correct for the Reagan Effect. Both corrected only partially, and
with spectacular results. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another common method is to define
property tax payments as only
the net burden after deducting payments from taxable income. This is
to impute a regressive feature of the income tax to the property tax.
That would be wrong at best, but more so when one is comparing the
property tax with the income tax itself. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If one does choose to evaluate the
two taxes jointly, he should
note above all that the Federal Government has moved far toward
abandoning the taxation of property income. That is the cumulative
effect of a hundred loopholes, available to property but not to the
poor stiff with his W-2 Form. Equity suggests that state and local
treasuries move in on this unpreempted tax base. </small><font

Lindy Davies: <a href="../docs/Davies_Ownership.html">Ownership and
the Law</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
President Bush's announcement of his vision for an "ownership society"
met with thunderous cheers at the Republican Convention, and much
eye-rolling elsewhere. The Bush Administration would like to start by
encouraging private ownership of our retirement funds and our
health-care decisions. They want to get the heavy hand of government
out of such things and unleash the tremendous efficiency of millions
upon millions of Self-Interested Individual Actors, the husky,
brawling, broad-shouldered capitalism that made this country great.
Prosperity depends on the security of private property and the potency
of individual initiative! This is the self-evident truth that has been
obscured by Hollywood Socialists, Democratic Girlie-men and purveyors
of the Homosexual Agenda.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We should realize, however, that this is hardly a new initiative. It is
really just the latest wave of an argument that has raged throughout
the history of the United States, about just what -- if anything -- and
on what basis -- if any -- the government can require us to surrender
what we possess. There are some people out there -- and actually a fair
number, after all -- who don't view the Bush Administration's
privatization proposals as extremist at all -- but, rather, too soft.
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Unfortunately, though, the law is not at all clear. Thomas Jefferson
fudged the topic in the United States Declaration of Independence,
inserting "the pursuit of happiness" where people expected the more
loaded term "property". The Bill of Rights, however, is strong on
property rights. It provides for security of "persons, houses, papers,
and effects," that "private property shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation" and that rights not specifically prohibited
are reserved to the states or to the people. In fact, the US
Constitution was so bullish on property that it provided for private
property in human beings, a principle made explicit in Dred Scott vs.
Sandford and many other cases. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Slavery was made unconstitutional by means of the 13th Amendment
in
1865. This, however, left much to be resolved, and the Congress had a
very difficult job -- perhaps, in strictly logical terms, an impossible
job -- in drafting Amendment number fourteen.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
The 14th amendment reaffirms the rights of life, liberty and property,
and binds the states to the same due process and equal protection
restrictions as the federal government. However, it places the
Constitution's first limit on the right of property, stating that the
United States or any state shall not pay "any claim for the loss or
emancipation of any slave". This could be seen as somewhat fishy in
terms of the Fifth Amendment. After all the 13th amendment had taken
the slaveholders' property three years before. Had not the Supreme
Court ruled that slaves were property and had to be returned to their
owners, even if they escaped to non-slaveholding states?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Although it would have been impracticable (to say the least) to enforce
the Takings Clause to the tune of the market value of some four million
human beings, that was what the Constitution required the government to
do.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
The next amendment to the Constitution following the Reconstruction
Amendments was another milestone in the debate over property rights.
The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, allows Congress to &#8220;lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived&#8221; -- contravening
the restriction of this practice that had been laid out in Article I.
The &#8220;from whatever source derived&#8221; part has been making people scream
bloody murder ever since. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
The original advocates of the income tax (many of them Single Taxers)
sought to tax accumulation, not industry and initiative. They saw that
the massive concentration of wealth among a privileged few was harmful
to the nation, and they persuaded the states to accept a progressive
tax that would compel robber barons to pay for public goods while
letting entrepreneurs gain from their contributions to overall
prosperity. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">And yet, over
the years, a tax on income &#8220;from whatever
source derived&#8221; came, one loophole at a time, to be a tax on exactly
those productive, hardworking, middle-class people that it was designed
to help. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
In most people's minds, after all, land is the most solid and important
kind of property; in fact, the word "property" in general conversation
most often means "land". However, it has long been recognized that
sometimes privately-held land must be taken for public purposes. The
principle of eminent domain is not (particularly) controversial. If the
state wants to put a highway through your house, it must pay you the
fair market value of your property.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
This decision was important because it extended the Takings doctrine
beyond physical seizure to the taking of value -- but it was also
relatively uncontroversial in that the state legislature had removed
all of the parcel's market value.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
If government were to be held liable for every single action that took
away a portion of real estate value, it could scarcely do anything at
all. That might be how some of the most strident militia-folk would
like it. However, it would certainly not suit real estate owners in
general -- who, while they might not enjoy paying for government, do
benefit from the things that government does.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What the property-rights folks are forgetting (or disregarding) is that
if a piece of land has a market value, that means that the net benefits
conferred upon it by the community (which includes the government) are
greater than the net costs. Location value is far and away the most
important component of land value -- and location value is almost
entirely the result of services and infrastructure that the government
provides. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It's no accident that the issue of "regulatory takings" is such a stew
of contradictions. Indeed, the terms of the argument deny the
possibility of coherence (in much the same way as they did in 1868).
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is not the fruit of
human labor, and its value is not the result
of any actions taken by its owner. Therefore, private property in land
is an entirely different sort of phenomenon than private property in
the products of labor -- and as long as the law fails to recognize this
fact, it cannot hope to make sense of the issue of "regulatory takings".</span>
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It could be suggested that "the conditions of the grant" could, without
doing any violence to the secure right of private property, require the
payment to the community of the land's rental value, to cover the cost
of the community's expenses which, it turn, provide the land's value in
the first place. That would, of course, require a clearer definition of
the moral basis of property that the United States has ever been able
to come to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet -- think of
it for a moment -- what would have happened
if the original Bill of Rights had articulated the individual's
absolute right to property only in the products of labor -- and the
community's right to the community-created value of the land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It would have saved us an awful lot of trouble. True, the "slavery"
states would have balked at joining the union under those rules. But
under them, the nation would have been so prosperous that they would
quite soon have seen the advantage of joining. We would have avoided
the Civil War, and probably even World War I -- it is dazzling to think
about how different -- and vastly better -- our history would have
been, had the Framers taken the brave step of setting forth the moral
basis of property along these lines.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It's interesting that we use the word "own" to mean two different
things: the sense of possession, and the sense of personal
acknowledgment, as in "owning up" to one's responsibilities. The
relationship between the two was once closer than it now seems to be;
the word "ought" is an archaic past participle of "owe". As we consider
how to arrange our "ownership society", we'd do well to remember what
we "ought" -- and bring the two senses of the word back together.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It
is important not to tax the profits of corporations</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a place where profits are not
taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</span></small>...<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span
