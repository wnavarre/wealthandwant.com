for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The way that land speculation can worsen economic efficiency is
by
giving land the greatest value to those who make the most foolish
overestimates of the rate at which it will rise in value.&nbsp; The
result is that much land is owned by people who have paid more for it
than can ever be recovered from its use.&nbsp; This is an example of a
phenomenon that economists call &#8216;<strong>the winner&#8217;s curse</strong>&#8217;.&nbsp; The general
description of the winner&#8217;s curse is that when a thing of uncertain
value is sold to the highest bidder (or a contract is let to the lowest
bidder), the person who wins the thing by bidding highest (or lowest)
will suffer the curse of having paid too much for it (or bid too
low).&nbsp; The winner&#8217;s curse arises commonly in such arenas as
bidding for oil leases and construction contracts.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The effect of the winner&#8217;s curse in the land market is that
those who
attach the greatest value to land are persons who believe that it would
be unprofitable to invest in improvements to the land, because it will
soon rise rapidly in value, and any improvements constructed now
would be sacrificed when the higher value of land was realized.&nbsp;
Thus, in land speculation, the winner&#8217;s curse produces the social cost
of an artificial scarcity of land for current use. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Since land speculation can, in theory, either improve or worsen
the
efficiency with which land is used, it is an empirical question as to
which effect predominates.&nbsp; While no conclusive evidence is
available, there are reasons for believing that the winner&#8217;s curse is
more powerful than the beneficial speculative withholding of
land.&nbsp; The first reason is casual empiricism.&nbsp; As one looks
around cities, it is easy to find places where vast amounts of barely
improved land surround islands of intense development.&nbsp; It
commonly happens that land near very tall buildings has been occupied
for many decades by one- or two-storey buildings, or even by nothing
more than a paved car park.&nbsp; This cannot be efficient.&nbsp; There
would have been time to fully depreciate substantial buildings while
owners have been waiting for the right time to develop land.&nbsp; The
inefficiency of leaving such land underused is the social cost of the
winner&#8217;s curse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is little evidence of inefficiency from premature land
development.&nbsp; If there were such evidence, it would take the form
of recently constructed buildings being demolished for more extensive
development, or possibly, in less extreme and less obvious cases, new
development surrounded by recent, substantially less extensive
development that could have been just as extensive as the new
development if only the developers had waited a little longer.&nbsp;
Examples of the first type of evidence are quite rare.&nbsp; Examples
of the second type would be easy to miss, but still there seems to be
no reason to suppose that they represent a problem of efficiency as
widespread as the problem of indefinitely deferred development induced
by the winner&#8217;s curse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The second reason for believing that deferred development
induced by
the winner&#8217;s curse is more of a problem than premature development
induced by a lack of foresight is that the latter problem can more
easily be resolved by new markets.&nbsp; If land should come to be
taxed so heavily that people stopped speculating in land, and if it
then transpired that people often lost money on their investments in
developing land because they underestimated the rate at which land
values would rise, then there would be a potential private market for
good predictions of the rates at which land values would rise.&nbsp; A
person who could foresee future rises in land values (a good speculator
in today&#8217;s markets) would have a comparative advantage in selling
insurance against a rise in land values, and hence in land taxes, that
would make current development unprofitable.&nbsp; Thus, in making land
speculation unprofitable, land taxation would redirect the energies of
those who believed they could predict rises in land values, away from
buying and holding land that they believed would rise in value, and
toward selling insurance against rises in land values where they
believed that there would be none.&nbsp; People would be discouraged
from building where land values were foreseen to rise rapidly, by the
unavailability of reasonably priced insurance against rises in land
taxes.&nbsp; Thus the potential development of a market for insurance
against rises in land values makes it unnecessary to maintain land
speculation as a mechanism to secure efficient deferral of
development.&nbsp; The benefits of eliminating the inefficient deferral
of development that is caused by the winner&#8217;s curse can be secured
without foregoing the benefits of redirecting development, based on
private knowledge of where land values will rise rapidly. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>An additional social cost of land speculation was elucidated by Harry Gunnison
    Brown (1927). He pointed out that when it is possible to profit from land speculation,
    land will tend to be acquired by those who have the most extreme beliefs about
    how much it will rise in value, and that such beliefs will generally be more
    optimistic
  than is warranted. Economists have given the name <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"winner's curse" </span>(Milgrom &amp; Weber, 1982)
  to the phenomenon that those who bid the most tend to bid too much. The winner's
  curse can cause the whole land market to become dominated by persons with extreme
  beliefs about future rises in value, creating an artificial scarcity of land
  for current use, as those who have land wait for illusory future opportunities.
  The winner's curse is thereby shifted to society. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
