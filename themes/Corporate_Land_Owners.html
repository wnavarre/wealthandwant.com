  <p>Much of our best land is held by corporations. Land in the central business

      land
      is worth.</p>
  <p>But land is not limited to the earth under our feet. It also includes such
      things as the broadcast spectrum. We say that the airwaves belong to the
    American people, but in reality, they belong to a small subset: the owners
    of corporate
      stock, which is very concentrated in a narrow band of our society. They
      sell individual broadcast frequencies, reaping profits that a just society
      would recognize that they did not earn. </p>
  <p>Land also includes our natural resources, for which very small royalties
    are paid.</p>
  <p>Should the economic value of things that are in scarce supply, of which
    none of
    us can make more, be monopolized by a few individuals or corporations? Or
    is there a more just way to organize ourselves and our economy? Georgists

is a Progressive Tax<br>
</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Corporate shares are not taxable
property, but of course corporate
income is mostly derived from taxable
property.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(18)</i></b></small></font> Some
will object
that corporations have many owners and should not be treated as
single units. That is true, but again, it smacks of regression
fallacy. Wealthy owners also have many corporations, and in general
corporate shares are the most concentrated kind of asset.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ownership of large property gives
one control of other assets. Property is borrowing power and credit
rating: all studies show
interest rates to be very regressive with size and quality of
collateral, and terms easier. But simple borrowing is only the
beginning. With great wealth one goes into banking and exerts
multiple leverage. The story has been told many times, if not as
well, since Brandeis' <b><i>Other Peoples' Money</i></b>: collateral,
leverage, conglomerates, interlocking directorates, mergers, lender
suasion, industrial leadership, pyramiding, the Wallenberg Grip,
subcontracting market power, control of dealerships, . . . . Control
is power and status (psychic income), and control is a source of
additional income, as revealed by the premium prices of shares during
battles for control.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
in Table I probably understate concentration, for four
general reasons</span>:

  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many writers exempt corporate
shares from taxable wealth, faulting the property tax for not reaching
such "intangibles." Yet most corporate assets are very tangible at a
price. In most jurisdictions the largest property taxpayers are
corporations.(24) Studies based on individual ownership alone and
omitting corporate wealth are simply not relevant.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A large genre of partial
inventories is the farm study, of which
every Agricultural Experiment Station must have issued one or more.
Hardly anyone wealthy enough to own a large farm today lacks nonfarm
income. One cannot afford to keep a large farm without using it as
an income tax shelter - that is the "highest and best use" under our
income tax law. Studies purporting to compare "farm income" with
farm property taxes are founded on the obsolete premise that
"farmers" are a separate class of people, and have no value.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. Accepting
straw owners as separate owners.</b> Large land assemblies are
habitually arranged through straw owners. Thus one large owner often
appears on records as several small ones. The Milwaukee CBD study,
as reported, is premised on one certain block's having several
separate owners, as recorded. Some time after the First Wisconsin
Bank announced it was building on the assembled
site,<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(25)</i></b></small></font> we did
not find it
listed as owner.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(26)</i></b></small></font><font

the other
hand, are not likely to appear as large ones. Wealthy families wear
several guises: banks, insurance companies, corporations, estates,
utilities, etc. Property is assigned to children and relatives to
split income. Rarely are these veils pierced by formal quantitative
studies. Even the ICC has never found out who owns the railroads. But
we can be quite certain ownership is held more closely in fact
than on paper. Nor did we
find Northwestern Mutual Life listed for more than its home office,
although Gordon Davidson, director of real estate, stated the company
had been acquiring land in our area "over the years."&nbsp;</small><font

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."
</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;The universal state and local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)
</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;The unique, remarkable
quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Hold on again," I have
heard, "how much revenue can land
yield by itself?" It is my job to address that. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I assure you it
can
yield more than local governments need.</span> I have already pointed
out
you can raise the rate to any level without fear of driving away
jobs, capital, people, or building. That is a remarkable quality in a
tax, especially one as progressive as the land tax. I will also
support the point in several other ways.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;The taxable capacity of
land is camouflaged in our times
by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a consistent modern
tendency to underassess it, relative to
buildings.</span> There are several studies in point. The most general
one
is the quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It
actually understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of
land most underassessed, that is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">raw acreage in and near
cities.</span> ...<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>"How about corporate
stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt
corporate wealth from the property tax?" Actually, almost all
jurisdictions already exempt stock and all other "intangible"
property. Not to worry, however, you tax corporate assets. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When you
rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten on most tax
rolls are all corporations. </span>None of their multi-national
profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and
creative transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your
assessor's maps. This makes sense anyway. Why should you think you
can tax a corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you
is its property in your town.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Wait another minute," I hear.
"Some corporations build bright new
plants in cow pastures, with a high fraction of building value. If
you exempt buildings, you let them off easy." There are cases in
point, I concede, like the blue-collar industrial suburbs of Cudahy
and South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Probably you could have said that in
Amsterdam, N.Y., when the rug industry was thriving there.
Amsterdam's fate, however, draws a moral about that. An industry that
depends on your land, your location, is likely to stay put; but an
industry that brings in most of its own assets, in the form of
capital, is mobile. What it brought in it can take out.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Take out buildings? Be
serious!" you may say. Buildings
look rooted to the spot, but that is illusory: those roots are
temporary. Buildings depreciate. They may be milked through
undermaintenance, and the <b>capital consumption allowances
(CCAs)</b> reinvested elsewhere. After a few years the plant is an
empty shell. They close it, flat-bed the equipment, and silently
steal away. If they really need nothing but a cow pasture, they can
find ten thousand others, anywhere, and reinvest their CCAs there.
You are wise not to tax such plants out of town. You need them, but
they can take their capital to greener pastures. Capital is mobile,
both coming and going. Only land stays put.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>In other cases,
industries occupy land of high value that
is wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it
has not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias
of assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to
improved "lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of
wholesale discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis,
Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
<a
 href="file:///C|/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#100%25%20location">100%
location</a>, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. To make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In still other cases "industry"
surrounds and intersperses itself
with vast swaths of vacant land. They hold it for open storage,
parking, purported "future expansion," accessways, buffers, backlots,
discouragement of competitors, etc. Many of Los Angeles' swankiest
buildings of today arose over the former surplus lands of the cinema
industry, which disgorged them before 1978 because they used to have
to pay substantial taxes on surplus lands.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Corporate" is not
coterminous with "industrial," anyway.
Many corporations are in retailing. They own chain stores, malls,
gasoline stations, auto dealerships, major real estate
"developments," drive-ins, office space, department stores, banks,
"power centers," etc. As to these, shifting to the land basis will
shift more of the tax burden to them, because retailing has a higher
land fraction than any other major land use (except vacant, golf
courses, cemeteries, parking lots, etc.). <b>That is because location
is more critical to retailers than other businesses. You can tell
this by their high rate of tear-downs and remodeling.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Among its other effects,
site-value taxation will induce
some land to shift from retail to industrial use.</b> Recall that
exempting the building, or prospective building, lets buyers bid more
for land. The higher the building fraction, the stronger is that
force. Thus the present system, which is biased against buildings
generally, is biased against industrial compared with retail uses.
Removing that bias will help industry outbid retail for land -- not
all land, of course, but land on the tipping point between the uses.
Most towns today seem oversupplied with retailers, compared with
their shortage of basic industries. Shifting to the site-value basis
of property taxation helps redress that balance.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Let the market decide,"
some say. "No good can come from
forcing land into use, against the owner's private judgment."
Actually,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the proposal to exempt
buildings and focus property taxes
on site values is premised on the market concept of consumer
sovereignty;</span> it's the present property tax that isn't. The case
may
be summed up like this: if the tax on a parcel varies with the use of
the parcel, then the tax biases choices against the use more
taxed.<b> Economists call the land tax "neutral," for that very
reason: it does not vary with use.</b> It does not bias the choice of
uses; the consumer sovereign prevails. "No other tax can make that
statement."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;I do not view that as saying
we should throw away other
social controls over land use. I have written a short piece,
"<b><i>Land Planning and the Property Tax</i></b>," showing how land
taxation strengthens the hand of planners and helps them and the
market work together. There are a few libertarians who would
terminate city planning altogether, but that is pretty extreme, and
not the proposal we should be considering here today. Rather, let us
consider a measured proposal, an incremental change within the
framework of present law and custom.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive
feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
balance of payments. When you
get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
the value of its own base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.&nbsp; </b><a style="font-weight: bold;"

Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.
<strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What
is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate. ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in
the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.<strong> ... </strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>The result is that real
estate corporations pay minimal income
taxes -- some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
billion
paid by corporate America as a whole.<span

Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> These
three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
gains
taxes to pay on their cash flow. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable
capital
gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
the property&#8217;s depreciated value. The tax accountant&#8217;s book-value gains
result from charging off capital
consumption allowances as a tax credit against cash flow. The more
generous are the capital consumption write-offs for real estate, the
more rapidly a property&#8217;s book value is written down. The fiction of
fast write-off is eventually &#8220;caught&#8221; as a capital gain when the real
estate is either sold or refinanced.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The greatest accounting distortion for the real estate industry
occurs
in the case of re-depreciation of buildings that already have been
depreciated at least once. This redepreciation occurs following
ownership transfers; the CCA is attached not to the physical asset, but
to the change of ownership. As the building is resold at rising prices,
investors are allowed to re-depreciate them again and again -- and to
write off these CCAs against their income, as if they were suffering an
erosion of wealth. Thus, most capital gains in real estate represent
&#8220;repeat gains&#8221; over unrealistically written-down book values. This
accounting fiction enables real estate investors to continue
indefinitely to take their income in the lightly taxed form of capital
gains.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Landlords already deduct from earnings as normal business
expenses
their maintenance and repair expenditures, undertaken to counteract the
wear and tear of buildings.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> A rule of
thumb in the real estate industry
is that such expenditures typically consume about ten percent of rental
revenue.</span> More importantly, although nearly all&nbsp;land
gains are made fully taxable, there is little reason to assume that
physical deterioration should be compensated by a special allowance to
enable the landlord to
recover his capital investment within a given number of years.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... Significantly, today these buildings have been fully
depreciated
and therefore are probably about to be sold, at least for book-keeping
purposes -- owners may buy their own buildings under different
partnerships, or swap them for similar buildings with other owners.
Their new owners can begin to depreciate them all over again, after
duly paying capital gains taxes on the buildings&#8217; increase over their
near-zero book value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If they do not sell and
re-depreciate their buildings, the owners will have to begin paying
income taxes on their operating cash flow that hitherto was sheltered
by depreciation allowances that have now run out. This lends a renewed
note of urgency to the persistent campaign to cut capital gains tax
rates.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Because excessive depreciation allowances favor real estate
speculation
relative to industrial production, they discourage new direct
investment and employment. To reduce the capital gains tax -- the only
significant remaining source of federal revenue from real estate --
would divert even more savings into the purchase and sale of existing
buildings.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Mortgage
Debt Converts Rent into Interest</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Depreciation rules are
not the only reason why the real estate
sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum of
income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion of
cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. Since the
early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
larger than the figures reported for net rental income. As Charts 3a,
3b, 3c, and 3d illustrate, real estate investors and homeowners have
become the financial sector&#8217;s prime customers. According to the Federal
Reserve Board, 1994 mortgage debt of $4.3 trillion represented some 46
percent of the economy's $9.3 trillion private nonfinancial debt, and a
third of the total $12.8 trillion U.S. debt.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> NIPA
statistics indicate that about 70 percent of loans to business
borrowers currently are made to the real estate sector, making it the
major absorber of savings and payer of interest.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>No
capital gains duties are levied on estates passing to heirs. Indeed,
inheritors of real estate may begin re-depreciating their
income-yielding buildings afresh at the new (typically higher) transfer
price. The estates bequeathed by the richest one percent of the
population (over $600,000
in value) are now taxed at a 55 percent rate if not sheltered, but of
course these are the estates most likely to shelter inheritance and
gift bequests. For instance, assets given as gifts are taxed only at
the time they come to be sold.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30</span></small> If
the capital gains tax were reduced or abolished, the deferral would
become
permanent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most capital gains reaped by business partnerships accrue to
real
estate firms, which shelter personal income by avoiding incorporation.
IRS statistics ranking capital gains in terms of how long the assets
were held show that many of these gains represent quick &#8220;flips." Often
these are land that has been rezoned from a low-value to a high-value
use. Retaining the capital gains tax would have little effect on
deterring such speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Properties held for longer periods of time by these partnerships
typically are sold or swapped after having been fully depreciated.
Swaps&#8217; have long been permitted to the real, many almost perpetually
free of income taxation. The logic for this
loophole seems at first glance to be much like that for personal
homeowners&#8217; exemptions in selling a home to move somewhere else,
without having to pay a capital gain tax in the process; but the
analogy is specious. Homeowners cannot take a depreciation tax credit
unless their property generates rental income, and most do not generate
any income against which to claim CCAs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small>. In
contrast, the capital gains which commercial real estate investors
record for income-tax purposes are calculated, not merely on the gain
in the property&#8217;s market price (as with owner-occupied homes), but on
the excess of selling price over depreciated book value. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>31 Homeowners do receive
imputed
rental income, which is not subject to the income tax.<br>
</small></small></font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Major commercial real estate
investors such as pension funds, insurance
companies and other large institutions are exempt from capital gains
taxes, as are foreign investors. In addition to playing a dominant role
in real estate, these institutional investors own nearly half of all
U.S. equities <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Reported capital gains in real estate were understated as a
result of
exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as
land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land -- raiders bought publicly
traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
were capital gains. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>IRS estimates of capital gains measure only the small proportion
that
individuals are obliged to declare after all the exemptions and
exclusions have been utilized. There is no estimate of the volume of
capital gains generated each year, and no adequate breakdown as to
where these gains occur. This statistical lacuna means that the
economic cost of assorted tax loopholes is not being calculated. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is no sound
statistical basis for calculating the total returns being taken by
investors, or the proportion of those returns paid in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">taxes.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>When
statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
less than their legislated tax share. Also -- and of direct relevance
to
our thesis -- the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
indeed tend to spur productivity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Academic economists likewise have been remarkably slow to
address this
shift away from earned income to capital gains. It is true that
nineteenth-century land reformers such as John Stuart Mill and Leon
Wahas defined land-value gains as an &#8220;unearned increment,&#8221; and urged
that they be collected by the community at large, whose economic
activity was, after all, responsible for creating these gains. Ever
since Henry George brought matters to a head in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span> (1879),
however, economics has largely dropped the analysis of land-value
gains, and indeed, of land itself<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Wealthy
investors have won congressional support for
real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
Household real estate assets substantially exceeded holdings of stocks,
bonds and trust funds (20.5 percent in 1989), liquid assets (17
percent) and total debt (14 percent).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> The
giveaway to real estate interests is thus presented ostensibly as a
popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that
preferences for home ownership cannot be justified as a boost to
entrepreneurial investment. Such is the foreshortened economic
perspective of our times.</small></div>

<small>The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to the
buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate
balance
sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is
thus by
no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
securities today.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases,
lenders,
for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other
natural
resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
-- and the capital gains on these assets -- than they do its income.
They
also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained.
Edward
Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
society.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">43 Wolff (1995),
        p. 27. &#8220;The top
one percent of wealth holders
has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
percentile of the income distribution. &#8221;</font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><small></small>Given the current US depreciation laws and
related
institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
sold off to meet current expenses -- sold to the very wealth-holders
being
freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
these gains at a lower rate than earned income -- a&nbsp; fight that
has broken
out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections. ...&nbsp; </small><a

  <p>Noticing rent, realizing its social nature, accepting that it's to be shared,
    and understanding that wages and interest should not be expropriated, for
    most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking such thoughts leads to
    a new way of conceiving economics, too. Ecological economics becomes not
    just a branch of economics but a whole new discipline, needing a new name.
    In geonomics we maintain the distinction between items bearing exchange value
    that come into being by human effort &#8212; wealth &#8212; and those that
    don't &#8212; land. Keeping this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious
    and non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that hoarding
    land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy land plus buildings
    engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is quasi-rent, that the cost of
