Value Rating</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The general principle that is
applied in site value rating is that
everyone pays for the naturally created and publicly created
resources they use. There are a number of ways in which this
principle can be extended. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Where
driving in crowded cities adds
noticeably to the travel costs of others, there should be charges
corresponding to those costs, provided that the administrative costs
of implementing such a system are not so great as to outweigh the
benefits of resulting improvements in traffic flows. </span>Activities
such
as the consumption of alcohol that have socially adverse consequences
should be taxed according to the costs of those consequences. Public
services--gas, electricity, telephone, water, sewerage,
transportation, etc.--whether publicly or privately owned, are best
financed by a combination of charges on users and charges on land.
Each user should be required to pay the addition to costs that
results from serving him or her. The component of costs that is not
covered by such charges on users can be recovered by collecting the
increase in land values that comes from provision of public
services.... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html"><br>
</a></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>III. Applications
to Congestion</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The logic of efficient
environmental protection applies with few
changes to issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple
example of the application of land value taxation to solving a
problem of congestion. If there is a shortage of parking places (at a
zero price) then the introduction of parking meters (charging rent
for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the price of
a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and
demand at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking
only where the revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the
value of the additional lane in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few
years we will have parking meters with prices that vary by time of
day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime, we get by
with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the day
when demand is greatest.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charging rent for parking is only
a small step from charging rent
for cars that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on
the streets, the slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having
one more car on the streets is the value of the extra travel time
that everyone else endures because of the one additional car. In many
places, the congestion cost of traffic is less than the cost of
administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not the case
everywhere. <b>William Vickrey</b> used to say that his estimate of
the cost in additional delays of having one more car in midtown
Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour. He
would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be
charged $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan.
He had estimated marginal cost at the present level of usage. The
efficient charge -- perhaps $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the
streets so greatly that the marginal congestion cost of street usage
would equal the price. Efficient congestion prices for using the
streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities) would not
merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special
charges for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal
way that created congestion. If we could keep track of the movements
of vehicles, then for any vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up
vehicles that wanted to move, there would be a charge for the
resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high. Companies
making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the
day. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Congestion charges also apply
to bottlenecks such as bridges
and tunnels.</b> Whenever such a facility has cars backed up seeking
to use it, efficiency is improved by applying a toll that reduces
demand to capacity. The same output is produced, revenue is
generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The efficiency of congestion
pricing would also apply to such
public facilities as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to
have more take-offs and landings than an airport can accommodate, it
is efficient and just to allocate take-off and landing slots by
price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest of airlines, has
prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead to
allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Central Park in New York, there
are fewer baseball fields than
are demanded at a zero price. There is a private company that has the
right and responsibility to organize the leagues that are allowed to
use the fields. This company is able to charge fees that implicitly
include the scarcity value of the fields. A recognition that the
parks are the common heritage of everyone in the city would lead
instead to a charge for using the ball fields that equated supply and
demand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are also applications of
congestion prices at an
international level. For example, <b>there may be congestion in
geosynchronous orbits for satellites</b>. If this should occur, then
the just thing to do is to charge market-clearing rents for
geo-synchronous orbits and share the proceeds among all nations in
proportion to their populations.&nbsp; <b>... </b><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.&nbsp; </small><a

discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as

use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.</small><br>

incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span></small><br

<br>
<small>The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">Stemming Sprawl: The Fiscal Approach</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
  <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
      are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium of
      forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation to
          users and <br>
                2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                    is really the socially created value. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
      investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
      and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
      to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing the land
      rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is socially created value, which
      is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than allowing
      it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property close by. User
      fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
      as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
      with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
      ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
      charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
      accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
      and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
      use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
  <p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
      and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with the
      costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom, it
      is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
      level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be linked
      to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption, to the
      full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental ambiences.
      Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing design for
      highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
      The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
      average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68
      billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours
      stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
      times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes
      one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But
      not all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
      time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people to
      impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored
      in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway space. In
      a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a form of land
      rent. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
    Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
    </a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...
The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
<small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel.</small><br>
<br>
<small>From the standpoint of an economic geographer, and for some land
economists, land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land
rent is the surplus generated by social activity on or in the vicinity
of locational sites which accrues to titleholders of those parcels.
Whether or not it is recaptured by public policy, rent is a natural
factor deriving from the intensive use of natural capital. More
intensive use of high value landsites leads to site configurations that
are less dependent upon transportation services. People can access them
easily even by walking. One must remember that transportation is not an
end in itself but rather a means. This is something often forgotten
even by urban planners, the distinction between accessibility and
mobility. As explained well in a recent text, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Geography of Urban Transportation</span>:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Accessibility
</span>refers to the number of opportunities, also called activity
sites, available within a certain distance or travel time. Mobility
refers to the ability to move between different activity sites (e.g.,
from home to a grocery store).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(4)</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The result is that we do an awful lot of traveling to get what
and
where we want. We have paid enormously for mobility even at the expense
of access. Subsidizing motor vehicle transportation makes the problem
worse! Author Kirkpatrick Sale recognized this when he argued that</small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities are meant to stop
traffic. That
is their point. That is why they are there. That is why traders put
outposts there, merchants put shops there, hostellers erect inns there.
That is why factories locate there, why warehouses, assembly plants,
and distribution centers are established there. That is why people
settle and cultural institutions grow there. No one wants to operate in
a place that people are just passing through; everyone wants to settle
where people will stop, and rest, and look around, and talk, and buy,
and share.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)

Sociological studies have documented graphically how alienating the
car-dependent environment really is. There is an inverse correlation
between the ability of a street to move and to park cars and trucks,
and the amount of social interaction between neighbors on that street.
One study two decades ago compared three similar residential streets in
San Francisco, with different levels of traffic volumes. Residents on
the different streets were asked to indicate on the base maps of their
streets where friends and acquaintances lived. Those living on streets
with the least traffic volume had three times as many friends and twice

More recently Harvard Professor Robert Putnam has made similar findings
in his book Bowling Alone, and concluded that every ten minutes of
additional commuting time means ten percent less time devoted to
communal activity. Driving is no longer regarded as fun, not on today's
typically congested highways. There was a time when most people drove
cars for pleasure; today people resent their having to drive so much
and often see driving as a burden.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(19)</span></small> It
is also no accident also that on measures of livability, those
locations regarded as most attractive are also the ones that are most
bicycle-friendly.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(20)</span></small> A
number of recent books and their popularity reflect resentment over our
forced dependency on motor vehicle transportation Jane Holtz Kay's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Asphalt Nation</span>, Clay McShane's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Down the Asphalt Path</span>, Wolfgang
Zuckerman's <span style="font-style: italic;">End of the Road</span>,
and Katie Alford's <span style="font-style: italic;">Divorce Your Car</span>
are only a few such examples.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(21)</span></small> But
despite their vague discomfort people typically lack the perspicacity
to incorporate these non-pecuniary costs into their decisions about
locational choice. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The last dimension of motor vehicle transportation charges can
be
designed to reflect the costs of <span style="font-weight: bold;">congestion</span>.
To some extent, those costs are already borne by drivers since they pay
in the value of their time for that lost by slowed traffic. But not
everyone's time has the same value, and proper pricing of road use
reflective of time and place is an attractive solution to maintaining
the efficient flow of highway service. Here again, electronic road
pricing can help with efficiency.... <a
