Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...&nbsp;
Is it not a self-evident truth, as Thomas Jefferson said, that "the
land belongs in <a href="User_Fees.html">usufruct</a> to the living," and that they who have died
have left it, and have no power to say how it shall be disposed of?
Title to land! Where can a man get any title which makes the earth his
property? There is a sacred right to property &#8212; sacred because ordained
by the laws of nature, that is to say, by the laws of God, and
necessary to social order and civilisation. That is the right of
property in things produced by labour; it rests on the right of a man
to himself. That which a man produces, that is his against all the
world, to give or to keep, to lend, to sell or to bequeath; but how can
he get such a right to land when it was here before he came? Individual
claims to land rest only on appropriation. I read in a recent number of
the "Nineteenth Century," possibly some of you may have read it, an
article by an ex-prime minister of Australia in which there was a
little story that attracted my attention. It was of a man named
Galahard, who in the early days got up to the top of a high hill in one
of the finest parts of western Australia. He got up there, looked all
around, and made this proclamation: "All the land that is in my sight
from the top of this hill I claim for myself; and all the land that is
out of sight I claim for my son John."</small><br>
<br>
<small>That story is of universal application. Land titles everywhere
come from just such appropriations. Now, under certain circumstances,
appropriation can give a right. You invite a company of gentlemen to
dinner and you say to them: "Be seated, gentlemen," and I get into this
chair. Well, that seat for the time being is mine by the right of
appropriation. It would be very ungentlemanly, it would be very wrong
for any one of the other guests to come up and say: "Get out of that
chair; I want to sit there!" But that right of possession, which is
good so far as the chair is concerned, for the time, does not give me a
right to appropriate all there is on the table before me. Grant that a
man has a right to appropriate such natural elements as he can use, has
he any right to appropriate more than he can use? Has a guest in such a
case as I have supposed a right to appropriate more than he needs and
make other people stand up? That is what is done.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Why, look all over this country &#8212; look at this town or any other
town. If men only took what they wanted to use we should all have
enough; but they take what they do not want to use at all. Here are a
lot of Englishmen coming over here and getting titles to our land in
vast tracts; what do they want with our land? They do not want it at
all; it is not the land they want; they have no use for American land.
What they want is the income that they know they can in a little while
get from it. Where does that income come from? It comes from labour,
from the labour of American citizens. What we are selling to these
people is our children, not land. ... <a
