<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Civilization that is
Possible.</b>
</small><br>
<small>IN the effects upon the distribution of wealth, of making land
private property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox
presented by modern progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening
want with increasing wealth, of labor rendered more dependent and
helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving machinery, are the
inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of
gravitation. Private property in land is the primary cause of the
monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. It is
this, and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world
more mouths than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of
wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron law of wages," as the Germans call
it -- that, in spite of all advances in productive power, compels the
laboring-classes to the least return on which they will consent to
live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that are so often
attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. It is this that
condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the
pauperism of England and the tramps of America. It is this that makes
the almshouse and the penitentiary the marks of what we call high
civilization; that in the midst of schools and churches degrades and
brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness out of womanhood and the joy
out of childhood. It is this that makes lives that might be a
blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and more to
seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater
and greater inequality. ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it not clear that here is a
natural law &#8211; that is to say, a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it
mean anything else than that He Who ordained the State, with its needs,
has, in the values which attach to land, provided the means to meet
those needs?</small><br>
<br>
<small>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look
deeper still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the
purpose of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law, by
which land values increase with the growth of society, not only such a
perfectly adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our
intellectual perceptions, by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but
a purpose with regard to the individual that gratifies our moral
perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of His beneficence.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>It is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses of
men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
For the value that with the increase of population and social advance
attaches to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured
ownership of the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation
in land wherever there is any prospect of advancing population or of
coming improvement, thus producing an artificial scarcity of the
natural element of life and labor, and a strangulation of production
that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial depression as
disastrous to the world as destructive wars.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Evil upon evil.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new
countries, only to bring there the same curses.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is this that causes our material advance not merely to fail
to improve the condition of the mere worker, but to make the condition
of large classes positively worse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is this that, in our richest Christian countries, is giving
us a large population whose lives are harder, more hopeless, more
degraded than those of the veriest savages.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is this that leads so many
men to think that God is a bungler, and is constantly bringing people
into the world for whom He has not made provision.</span> <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, Ireland,
who sees all this very clearly, has made striking testimony to the
design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for
the community. In a <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">pastoral
letter addressed to the clergy and laity
of his diocese</a>, April 2, 1881, he says :</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;This great
social fact is of incalculable importance; and, on the strictest
principles of justice, it is not clouded even by a shadow of
uncertainty or doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty
in the clearness with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence
of the designs of Providence in the admirable provision He has made for
the wants and the necessities of that state of social existence in
which the very instincts of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A
vast public property, a great national fund, has been placed under the
dominion and at the disposal of the nation to supply itself abundantly
with resources necessary to liquidate the expenses of its government
and the administration of its laws.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;One of the
most interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is
constantly progressive and increasing in a direct ratio to the growth
of the population, and the very causes that increase and multiply the
demands made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.&#8221;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>He says further:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Any
settlement of the land of a country that would exclude the humblest man
in that country from his share of the common inheritance would be not
only an injustice and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, would be an
impious resistance to the benevolent intentions of his Creator.&#8221;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in
the clearness with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are
revealed in the provision made for the common needs of society in what
economists call the law of rent. Of all the evidence that natural
religion gives, it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a
beneficent God!</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this beautiful provision for
social needs we see that God
has intended civilisation; that all our discoveries and inventions do
not, and cannot, outrun His forethought; and that steam, electricity,
and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer and
more important.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the growth of this great fund,
increasing with social
advance &#8211; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community, and
belongs, therefore; to the community &#8211; we see, not only that there is
no need for the taxes that lessen wealth; that engender corruption, and
promote inequality, but, that to take this fund for the purpose for
which it was intended would secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s
bounty &#8211; the abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants and provide
amply for every legitimate need of the State.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We see that God in His dealings
with men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that He has not brought
too many men into the world, that He has not neglected abundantly to
supply them; that He has not intended that bitter competition of the
masses for a mere animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of
wealth which characterise our civilisation; but, that these evils,
which lead so many to say there is no God, or yet more impiously to say
that they are of God&#8217;s ordering, are due to our denial of His moral
law. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To persist in a wrong, to refuse
to undo it, is always to
become involved in other wrongs!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who defend private property
in land, and thereby deny
the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right to
the material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses.
Either they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the
hindmost,&#8221; deny the equal right to life, and, by some theory like that
to which Malthus has given his name, assert that Nature brings into the
world more men than there is provision for; or, they must, as do the
Socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are wrongs. ...&nbsp;<a

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1 style2">[01] </span>THE American  Republic is today unquestionably foremost of the nations &mdash; the van  leader of modern civilization. Of all the great peoples of the European  family, her people are the most homogeneous, the most active and most  assimilative. Their average standard of intelligence and comfort is  higher; they have most fully adopted modern industrial improvements,  and are quickest to utilize discovery and invention; their political  institutions are most in accordance with modern ideas, their position  exempts them from dangers and difficulties besetting the European  nations, and a vast area of unoccupied land gives them room to grow.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style2">[02]</span> At the rate of increase so far maintained, the English-speaking  people of America will, by the close of the century, number nearly one  hundred million &mdash; a population as large as owned the sway of Rome in  her palmiest days. By the middle of the next century &mdash; a time which  children now born will live to see &mdash; they will, at the same rate,  number more than the present population of Europe; and by its close  nearly equal the population which, at the beginning of this century,  the whole earth was believed to contain.<br>
<br>
<span class="style2">[03] </span>But the increase of power is more rapid than the increase of  population, and goes on in accelerating progression. Discovery and  invention stimulate discovery and invention; and it is only when we  consider that the industrial progress of the last fifty years bids fair  to pale before the achievements of the next that we can vaguely imagine  the future that seems opening before the American people. The center of  wealth, of art, of luxury and learning, must pass to this side of the  Atlantic even before the center of population. It seems as if this  continent had been reserved &mdash; shrouded for ages from the rest of the  world &mdash; as the field upon which European civilization might freely  bloom. And for the very reason that our growth is so rapid and our  progress so swift; for the very reason that all the tendencies of  modern civilization assert themselves here more quickly and strongly  than anywhere else, the problems which modern civilization must meet,  will here first fully present themselves, and will most imperiously  demand to be thought out or fought out. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

    Today </a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As this book was written, the
Industrial Revolution was
transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a
century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort
had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
evaporating.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor
Henry George marveled at the
stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished want
and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
classes from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the
division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
had increased the dependence of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces
beyond their control. The working poor were always, of course, the
most vulnerable in depressions, and last to recover from them.
Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America, and indeed, were
more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. It
was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath
society, but through society. Those who are above the point of
separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down."
This, the "great enigma of our times," was the problem George set out
to solve in <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></span>.
<strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
earnings of the factors of
production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
persistently low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of
increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
give but a bare living?"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds systematically.
First, George explores the
prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
therefore, wages - to recede again.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Moreover, population growth
diminished agricultural productivity
by forcing recourse to inferior soils. Technological advance and
capital accumulation might afford a period of relative prosperity -
but ultimately, increasing applications of labor to a fixed amount of
land could raise output only at a diminishing rate. In short,
immutable laws of nature - the population principle and the law of
diminishing returns to land - were widely believed to explain the
persistence of poverty.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
George, the Malthusian analysis was abhorrent: It asserted that
no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
rates. </span>Fortunately, he found this theory of wages to be
theoretically
flawed on several grounds. He also found it to be incompatible with
empirical facts, based on historical case studies from Ireland,
China, India, the United States and elsewhere. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today, most
development economists agree with George that famine and mass poverty
have more to do with faulty human institutions than with the
limitations of nature. ... 
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most economists deem it their
business to evaluate the efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
he asserted the reverse: <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</small> ...<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Political economists can see no
possible way in which English
operatives can permanently improve their condition, except they have
recourse to that revolting and unnatural expedient of voluntarily
restraining and limiting their numbers. "This, then," says Mr.
Cairnes -- the limitation of his numbers -- "is the circumstance on
which, in the last resort, any improvement at all of a permanent kind
in the labourer's condition turns."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the self-commissioned apostles
who preach this new doctrine
only warned the people against the consequences of reckless and
improvident marriages, I would join and go with them heartily. But
when they advise them (as they seem to me to do) to increase and
multiply according to the requirements of trade, and in such
proportions as they may be wanted, for the benefit of their betters;
when they advise them to increase and multiply only when trade is
prosperous, prices are high and commerce flourishes, I am heartily
opposed to them.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These teachings appear to me not

<p>Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/justice_the_object_taxation_the_means.html">Justice
the Object -- Taxation the Means</a> (1890)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, look at it here today, in
this new country, where there are
as yet only 65 millions of us scattered over a territory that in the
present stage of the arts is sufficient to support in comfort a
thousand millions; yet we are actually thinking and talking as if
there were too many people in the country. We want more wealth. Why
don't we get it? Is any factor of production short? What are the
factors of production? Labour, capital, and land; but to put them in
the order of their importance: land, labour, capital. We want more
wealth; what is the difficulty? Is it in labour; is there not enough
labour? No. From all parts of the United States we hear of what seems
like a surplus of labour. We have actually got to thinking that the
man who gives another employment is giving him a boon. Is there any
scarcity of capital? Why, so abundant is capital today that United
States bonds, bought at the current rate, will only yield a fraction
over 2% per annum. So abundant is capital that there can be no doubt
that a government loan could be floated today at 2% and little doubt
but that it would soon command a premium. So abundant is capital that
all over the country it is pressing for remunerative employment. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the limitation is not in
labour and not in capital, it must be
in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
Francisco? Go to that great city of New York, where people are
crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. Yet, why are there
not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
which to build more houses. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today one half of the area of
New York City is unbuilt
upon &#8212; is absolutely unused. When there is such a pressure, why
don't people go to these vacant lots and build there? Because though
unused, the land is owned; because, speculating upon the future
growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.
What you see in New York, you may see everywhere. Come into the
coalfields of Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands
and thousands of miners unable to work, either locked out by their
employers, or striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages
being cut down a little more. <a

likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated?

  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population?

making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal

ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or

their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. As the principal
focus of this paper is on inflation, let us give this process its
full name which is fiat money inflation and let us define this as the
process by which a government continues the issuance of irredeemable
paper money until the quantity so issued finally renders it
worthless.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"> <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Everything above points to there
being a low ceiling on Georgist
taxation applied locally. Henry George recognized that the power
elite of landowner/employers use Malthus' doctrine to oppose raising
wages -- it would just spawn an invasion of new brats into the work
force, they said, bringing wage rates back down to bare subsistence. To
make his points, George had to refute Malthus. George's view
mostly prevailed, with exceptions, until fairly recent times.
Neo-classical economists even hijacked it, with a reverse spin, to
trivialize land values. Whatever we may think of Malthus today,
there is no doubt that the fear of population increments from outside
the taxing polity now plays the role that George ascribed to
Malthusianism, and plays it with devastating effect.... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Leapfrogging,

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The environmental damage from
those attitudes might not be so bad
were it not for leapfrogging, urban disintegration, and floating
value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging is when
developers jump over the next eligible
lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there.
</span>This has been a problem in expanding economies ever since cities
emerged from within their ancient walls and stockades, but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in our
times and our country it has gone to unprecedented extremes, with
subsidized superhighways and universal auto ownership and truck
shipping.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred
Gobar, savvy real estate
consultant from Placentia, has
recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
miles). </span>That would be at a density of 3625 people per square
mile, or
5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">He
is not being stingy with land,
at 3625 persons per square mile.</span>
The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
mile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">On
Manhattan's upper East Side they
pile up at over 100,000 per
square mile. </span>They do not crowd like this out of desperation,
either.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may think of rats in
cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
they actually like it there!</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take 10,000 per square mile as a
reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><span

  Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical
  resolutions and synergies</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Adding people
          and capital w/o diluting resource base</b>  </p>
  <p>Georgist policy lets a region, nation, or the world add population
    and/or capital without diluting its resource base. It is as though
    rescuers pulled drowning people into a lifeboat, and their presence
    made the boat expand instead of sink! Call it <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"The Accommodating
    Lifeboat Theorem."</span> It sounds like the Miracle of the Loaves and
    Fishes, but it is a different kind of miracle: synergy. It comes
    from the power of enlarging the market, as described by George in his
    chapter on the effects of increased population, and Adam Smith in his
    aphorism, "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the
    market." An indication of it is that bigger cities around the world
    have more land value per head than small ones, as documented by
    William Alonso. </p>
  <p>We must temper this claim. Bigger cities are often located on
    better land, so size isn't all that accounts for Alonso's finding.
    However, more than sheer size, and more than good natural location,
    is the internal circulation of a city. Georgist policies are
    essential to financing good circulation, containing sprawl, and
    inducing private land development complementary to the circulatory
    system.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a
