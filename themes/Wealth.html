          be <em>produced</em>, and land (not just acreage, but all of
          the natural creation) is not something <em>any</em> of us can

          more common
          usage, in which it refers to all of one's assets without regard to
          their nature. Keep in mind the distinction between common usage and

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... These are truisms. Yet so widespread and persistent is the notion that
    all property should be taxed, that they are generally ignored. Nothing is
    clearer
    than that when a farmer who wants more capital puts a mortgage on his farm,
    no new value is thereby created. Yet, in most of our States, both the farm
    and the mortgage are taxed; though so obvious is the double taxation that
    in some of them the clumsy expedient of making an exemption to the debtor
    is resorted to.</p>
  <p> But it is manifest that property of this kind is not a fit subject for
    taxation, and ought not to be considered in making up the assessment rolls.
    It has, in itself, no value. It is merely the representative, or token, of
    value &#8212; the certificate of ownership, or the obligation to pay value.
    It either represents other property, or property yet to be brought into existence.
    And, as nothing real can be drawn from that which is not real, taxation upon
    property of this kind must ultimately fall, either upon the property represented,
    in which case there is double taxation, or upon those whose obligations it
    expresses, in which case men are taxed, not upon what they own, but upon
    what they owe; and all cumbrous devices to prevent the unjust effects of
    such taxation, like other complications of the revenue system, simply give
    to the stronger and more unscrupulous opportunities of throwing the burden
    upon the weaker and more conscientious. Property of this kind ought not to
    be taxed at all. Property in itself valuable is clearly that with which any
    wise scheme of taxation should alone deal.</p>
  <p> To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. <strong>Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is
    such result of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human
    desire. </strong>A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
            the result of human exertion; </li>
    <li>the one exists from generation to generation,
              while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay,
      and can only be preserved by continual exertion. </li>
    <li>To the one, the right
        of exclusive
                possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the
      right of property in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to
      the other,
              the right
                of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations
        which
            are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. </li>
    </ul>
      <p>Nor are
            these mere abstract distinctions. They are distinctions of the first
          importance in determining
                  what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
      <p> For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human
        exertion, it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the
        general prosperity,
          it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue
        while there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to
        land. We may
          tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree
        lessening the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement
        to use
          land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to
        the production of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. We might
        take the whole value
          of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing,
        and the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect
        would
          be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase
        its capabilities, which are brought out by increased population. But
        impose anything like such
          taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth
        would be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable
        wealth
          would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon
        be the silence of desolation. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

<p>Henry George: <em><a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">Progress &amp; Poverty:</a></em><a href="HG/PP/03_b1_c2_meaning_of_the_terms.htm"> Wages &amp; Capital:
    The Meaning of the Terms</a> (Book I, Chapter 2)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land, labor, and capital are the three factors of production. If we remember
    that capital is thus a term used in contradistinction to land and labor, we
    at once see that nothing properly included under either one of these terms
    can be properly classed as capital. The term <strong>land</strong> necessarily
    includes, not merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water
    and the air, but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it
    is only by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man
    can come in contact with or use nature. The term land embraces, in short, all
    natural materials, forces, and opportunities, and, therefore, nothing that
    is freely supplied by nature can be properly classed as capital. A fertile
    field, a rich vein of ore, a falling stream which supplies power, may give
    to the possessor advantages equivalent to the possession of capital, but to
    class such things as capital would be to put an end to the distinction between
    land and capital, and, so far as they relate to each other, to make the two
    terms meaningless. The term <strong>labor</strong>, in like manner, includes
    all human exertion, and hence human powers whether natural or acquired can
    never properly be classed as capital. In common parlance we often speak of
    a man's knowledge, skill, or industry as constituting his capital; but this
    is evidently a metaphorical use of language that must be eschewed in reasoning
    that aims at exactness. Superiority in such qualities may augment the income
    of an individual just as capital would, and an increase in the knowledge, skill,
    or industry of a community may have the same effect in increasing its production
    as would an increase of capital; but this effect is due to the increased power
    of labor and not to capital. Increased velocity may give to the impact of a
    cannon ball the same effect as increased weight, yet, nevertheless, weight
  is one thing and velocity another.</p>
  <p>Thus we must exclude from the category of capital
    everything that may be included either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain
    only things which are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted from
    the union of these two original factors of production. Nothing can be properly
    capital that does not consist of these that is to say, nothing can be capital
    that is not wealth.</p>
  <p> But it is from ambiguities in the use of this
    inclusive term wealth that many of the ambiguities which beset the term capital
    are derived.</p>
  <p> As commonly used the word &quot;wealth&quot; is
    applied to anything having an exchange value. But when used as a term of
    political economy it must be limited to a much more definite meaning, because
    many things
    are commonly spoken of as wealth which in taking account of collective or
    general wealth cannot be considered as wealth at all. Such things have an
    exchange
    value, and are commonly spoken of as wealth, insomuch as they represent as
    between individuals, or between sets of individuals, the power of obtaining
    wealth; but they are not truly wealth, inasmuch as their increase or decrease
    does not affect the sum of wealth. Such are bonds, mortgages, promissory
    notes, bank bills, or other stipulations for the transfer of wealth. Such
    are slaves,
    whose value represents merely the power of one class to appropriate the earnings
    of another class. Such are lands, or other natural opportunities, the value
    of which is but the result of the acknowledgment in favor of certain persons
    of an exclusive right to their use, and which represents merely the power
    thus given to the owners to demand a share of the wealth produced by those
    who use
    them. Increase in the amount of bonds, mortgages, notes, or bank bills cannot
    increase the wealth of the community that includes as well those who promise
    to pay as those who are entitled to receive. The enslavement of a part of
    their number could not increase the wealth of a people, for what the enslavers
    gained
    the enslaved would lose. Increase in land values does not represent increase
    in the common wealth, for what landowners gain by higher prices, the tenants
    or purchasers who must pay them will lose. And all this relative wealth,
    which, in common thought and speech, in legislation and law, is undistinguished
    from
    actual wealth, could, without the destruction or consumption of anything
    more than a few drops of ink and a piece of paper, be utterly annihilated.
    By enactment
    of the sovereign political power debts might be canceled, slaves emancipated,
    and land resumed as the common property of the whole people, without the
    aggregate wealth being diminished by the value of a pinch of snuff, for what
    some would
    lose others would gain. There would be no more destruction of wealth than
    there was creation of wealth when Elizabeth Tudor enriched her favorite courtiers
    by the grant of monopolies, or when Boris Godoonof made Russian peasants
    merchantable
    property.</p>
  <p>All things which have an exchange value are, therefore,
    not wealth, in the only sense in which the term can be used in political economy.
    Only such things can be wealth the production of which increases and the destruction
    of which decreases the aggregate of wealth. If we consider what these things
    are, and what their nature is, we shall have no difficulty in defining wealth.</p>
  <p> When we speak of a community increasing in wealth
    -- as when we say that England has increased in wealth since the accession
    of Victoria, or that California is a wealthier country than when it was a Mexican
    territory -- we do not mean to say that there is more land, or that the natural
    powers of the land are greater, or that there are more people, for when we
    wish to express that idea we speak of increase of population; or that the debts
    or dues owing by some of these people to others of their number have increased;
    but we mean that there is an increase of certain tangible things, having an
    actual and not merely a relative value -- such as buildings, cattle, tools,
    machinery, agricultural and mineral products, manufactured goods, ships, wagons,
    furniture, and the like. The increase of such things constitutes an increase
    of wealth; their decrease is a lessening of wealth; and the community that,
    in proportion to its numbers, has most of such things is the wealthiest community.
    The common character of these things is that they consist of natural substances
    or products which have been adapted by human labor to human use or gratification,
    their value depending on the amount of labor which upon the average would be
    required to produce things of like kind.</p>
  <p>Thus wealth, as alone the term can be used in
    political economy, consists of natural products that have been secured, moved,
    combined, separated, or in other ways modified by human exertion, so as to
    fit them for the gratification of human desires. It is, in other words, labor
    impressed upon matter in such a way as to store up, as the beat of the sun
    is stored up in coal, the power of human labor to minister to human desires.
    Wealth is not the sole object of labor, for labor is also expended in ministering
    directly to desire; but it is the object and result of what we call productive
    labor -- that is, labor which gives value to material things. Nothing which
    nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth, nor yet does the expenditure
    of labor result in wealth unless there is a tangible product which has and
    retains the power of ministering to desire.</p>
  <p>Now, as capital is wealth devoted to a certain
    purpose, nothing can be capital which does not fall within this definition
    of wealth. By recognizing and keeping this in mind, we get rid of misconceptions
    which vitiate all reasoning in which they are permitted, which befog popular
    thought, and have led into mazes of contradiction even acute thinkers.</p>
  <p> But though all capital is wealth, all wealth is
    not capital. Capital is only a part of wealth -- that part, namely, which is
    devoted to the aid of production. It is in drawing this line between the wealth
    that is and the wealth that is not capital that a second class of misconceptions
    are likely to occur. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Increase in the amount of bonds, mortgages, notes, or bank bills cannot
    increase the wealth of the community that includes as well those who promise
    to pay
    as those who are entitled to receive. The enslavement of a part of their
    number could not increase the wealth of a people, for what the enslavers

      <p>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility
        of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the
        produce of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
        of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some
        one else from whom the right has passed to him. For the right to the
        produce of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use
        of the opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property
        in these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
        nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by producers,
        the right of the producers to the fruits of their labor is to that extent

      <p>The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody

        their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character
        of the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist
        irrespective of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the
        field or environment in which man finds himself; the storehouse from
        which his needs must be supplied, the raw material upon which and the
        forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>

  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these

          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital. ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>... In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
          as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
          His
        loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
        is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
        or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
        a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
        but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read

  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; <em>The

<br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included
either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which are neither
land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these two original
factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

<br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book

  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
      <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
    <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>WHEN we speak of a community increasing in wealth we do not mean to say that
  there is more land, or that the natural powers of the land are greater, or
  that there are more people (for when we wish to express that idea we speak
  of increase of population) or that the debts or dues owing by some of these
  people to others of their number have increased; but we mean that there is
  an increase of certain tangible things, having an actual and not merely a relative
  value &#8212; such as buildings, cattle, tools, machinery, agricultural and
  mineral products, manufactured goods, ships, wagons, furniture and the like.
  . . . The common character of these things is that they consist of natural
  substances or products which have been adapted by human labor to human use
  or gratification, their value depending on the amount of labor which upon the
  average would be required to produce things of like kind.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

WEALTH is not the sole object of labor, for labor is also expended in ministering
directly to desire; but it is the object and result of what we call productive
labor &#8212; that is, labor which gives value to material things. Nothing which
nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth, nor yet does the expenditure
of labor result in wealth unless there is a tangible product which has and retains
the power of ministering to desire. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

IT will be well for a moment to consider this idea of accumulated wealth. The
truth is, that wealth can be accumulated but to a slight degree, and that communities
really live, as the vast majority of individuals live, from hand to mouth. Wealth
will not bear much accumulation; except in a few unimportant forms it will not
keep. The matter of the universe, which, when worked up by labor into desirable
forms, constitutes wealth, is constantly tending back to its original state.
Some forms of wealth will last for a few hours, some for a few days, some for
a few months, some for a few years; and there are very few forms of wealth that
can be passed from one generation to another. Take wealth in some of its most
useful and permanent forms &#8212; ships, houses, railways, machinery. Unless
labor is constantly exerted in preserving and renewing them, they will almost
immediately become useless. Stop labor in any community, and wealth would vanish
almost as the jet of a fountain vanishes when the flow of water is shut off.
Let labor again exert itself, and wealth will almost as immediately reappear.
Accumulated wealth seems to play just about such a part in relation to the social
organism as accumulated nutriment does to the physical organism. Some accumulated
wealth is necessary, and to a certain extent it may be drawn upon in exigencies;
but the wealth produced by past generations can no more account for the consumption
of the present than the dinners he ate last year can supply a man with present
strength. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>IN the economic meaning of the term production, the transporter or exchanger,
    or anyone engaged in any subdivision of those functions, is as truly engaged
    in production as is the primary extractor or maker. A newspaper-carrier or
    the keeper of a news-stand would, for instance, in common speech be styled
    a distributor. But in economic terminology he is not a distributor of wealth,
    but a producer of wealth. Although his part in the process of producing the
    newspaper to the final receiver comes last, not first, he is as much a producer
    as the paper-maker or type-founder, the editor, or compositor, or press-man.
    For the object of production is the satisfaction of human desires, that is
    to say, it is consumption; and this object is not made capable of attainment,
    that is to say, production is not really complete, until wealth is brought
    to the place where it is to be consumed and put at the disposal of him whose
    desire it is to satisfy.&nbsp; &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe301.html">unabridged:

PRODUCTION and distribution are not separate things, but two mentally distinguishable
parts of one thing &#8212; the exertion of human labor in the satisfaction of
human desire. Though materially distinguishable, they are as closely related
as the two arms of the syphon. And as it is the outflow of water at the longer
end of the syphon that is the cause of the inflow of water at the shorter end,
so it is that distribution is really the cause of production, not production
the cause of distribution. In the ordinary course, things are not distributed
because they have been produced, but are produced in order that they may be distributed.
Thus interference with the distribution of wealth is interference with the production
of wealth, and shows its effect in lessened production. &#8212; <em>The Science

          <br>
OUR inquiry into the laws of the distribution of wealth is not an inquiry into
the municipal laws or human enactments which either here and now, or in any other
time and place, prescribe or have prescribed how wealth shall be divided among
men. With them we have no concern, unless it may be for purposes of illustration.
What we have to seek are those laws of the distribution of wealth which belong
to the natural order &#8212; laws which are a part of that system or arrangement
which constitutes the social organism or body economic, as distinguished from
the body politic or state, the Greater Leviathan which makes its appearance with
civilization and develops with its advance. These natural laws are in all times
and places the same, and though they may be crossed by human enactment, can never
be annulled or swerved by it. It is more needful to call this to mind, because,
in what have passed for systematic treatises on political economy, the fact that
it is with natural laws, not human laws, that the science of political economy
is concerned, has, in treating of the distribution of wealth, been utterly ignored,
and even flatly denied. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe401.html">unabridged:

          </a><br>
THE distinction between the laws of production and the laws of distribution is
not, as is erroneously taught in the scholastic political economy, that the one
set of laws are natural laws and the other human laws. Both sets of laws are
laws of nature. The real distinction is that the natural laws of pro<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>duction
are physical laws and the natural laws of distribution are moral laws. . . .
The moment we turn from a consideration of the laws of the production of wealth
to a consideration of the laws of the distribution of wealth, the idea of ought
or duty becomes primary. All consideration of distribution involves the ethical
principle, is necessarily a consideration of ought or duty &#8212; a consideration
in which the idea of right or justice is from the very first involved. &#8212; <em>The

  <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
    tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous application
    of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak of it as free
    trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than
    a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. <strong>Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not
merely abolish all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct
taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath.</strong> &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, George differentiated sharply
    between land itself and the products &#8212; or wealth, as he termed them &#8212; which
    labor made from the land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural
    forces, but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter, and, to
    produce wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter and to these
    forces &#8212; that is to say, to land. The land is the source of all wealth.
    It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore that labor fashions. It is
    the substance to which labor gives the form."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> George saw, as between land and products,
    certain elementary differences. "In every essential, land differs from those
    things which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the creation of
    God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity; they may be increased
    illimitably. It exists, though generations come and go; they in a little

    things that satisfy want.43 But it is quite unnecessary to tediously specify
    these and trace them to their origin in detail. In searching for the source

  <p>As a common object of this kind, the production of which is a familiar process,
    bread is probably the best example for our purpose. Let us, then, carefully
    trace bread to its source. To make the results of our work clear to the eye
    as well as to the ear we will construct a chart as we proceed. The chart
    should begin with a classification of Bread with reference to Man, for it
    is as an object for satisfying the wants of man that we consider bread at
    all. Is Bread a part of the personality of Man? or is it an object external
    to him? That is our first question. The answer is so obvious that a child
    could make no mistake. Bread is external to Man. It should, therefore, be
    classified with what for brevity we will call &quot;External Objects.&quot; It
    is also a product having certain constituents.</p>
  <p>Let us so arrange the chart as to indicate these facts and also to provide
    a place for particularizing the constituents of bread as we ascertain them.
    Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Now let the necessary constituents of bread be inserted. Any housewife,
    any kitchen girl, knows what they are as well as does the most expert baker
    or learned chemist. They are named in the place reserved for them in the
    chart: [chart]</p>
  <p>In respect of Man the constituents of Bread all fall into two general classes:
    Man, and objects that are external to him &#8212; or, briefly, External Objects.
    Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>While all these External Objects are alike in the one particular that they
    are external to Man, some of them may differ from others in respects which,
    for clear thinking, must be distinguished. Compare the first two External
    Objects &#8212; the lot of land and the oven &#8212; and a radical difference
    at once appears. The lot of land is a natural object. The oven is an artificial
    object. The lot exists independently of man's art; the oven can have no existence
    whatever as an oven but for man's art. 44 And when the remaining External
    Objects are considered the same difference appears. Objects are considered
    the same difference appears. All of them, Bread included, differ from the
    lot of land precisely as the oven does; they are artificial.45 Let us note

  <p>Wealth is produced solely by the application of Labor to Land.51</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">50. It may at first seem like a great waste of time and space to have gone
        through this long analysis for no other purpose at last than to demonstrate
        the self-evident fact that land and labor are the sole original factors in
        the production of Wealth. But it will have been no waste if it enables the
        reader to firmly grasp the fact. Nothing is more obvious, to be sure. Nothing
        is more readily assented to. Yet by layman and college professor and economic
        author alike, this simple truth is cast adrift at the very threshold of argument
        or investigation, with results akin to what might be expected in physics
        if after recognizing the law of gravitation its effects should be completely
        ignored.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">51. There is ample authority among economic writers for this conclusion.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Professor Ely enumerates Nature, Labor, and Capital as
        the factors of production, but he describes Capital as a combination
        of Nature and Labor &#8212; Ely's
        Introduction, part ii, ch. iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Say describes industry as &quot; nothing more or less than human employment
        of natural agents.&quot; &#8212; Say's Trea., book i, ch. ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And though John Stuart Mill and numerous others speak of Land, Labor, and
        Capital as the three factors of production, as does Professor Jevons, most
        of them, like Jevons, recognize the fact, though in their reasoning they
        often fail to profit by it, that Capital is not a primary but a secondary
        requisite. See Jevons's Pol. Ec., secs. 16, 19.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Henry George says: &quot;Land, labor, and capital are the factors of production.
        The term land includes all natural opportunities or forces; the term labor,
        all human exertion; and the term capital, all wealth used to produce more
        wealth. . . Capital is not a necessary factor in production. Labor exerted
        upon land can produce wealth without the aid of capital, and in the necessary
        genesis of things must so produce wealth before capital can exist.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Also : &quot;The complexities of production in the civilized state, in which
        so great a part is borne by exchange, and so much labor is bestowed upon
        materials after they have been separated from the land, though they may to
        the unthinking disguise, do not alter the fact that all production is still
        the union of the two factors, land and labor.&quot;&#8212; Id., ch. viii.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is the final analysis. In the union of Labor, which includes all human
      effort,52 with Land, which includes the whole material universe outside of
      man,53 we discover the ultimate source of Wealth, which includes all the
      material things that satisfy want.54 And that is the first great truth upon
      which the single tax philosophy is built.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">52. The term labor includes all human exertion in the
        production of wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book i, ch. ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">53. &quot;The term land necessarily includes, not merely the surface of
        the earth as distinguished from the water and the air, but the whole material
        universe outside of man himself, for it is only by having access to land,
        from which his very body is drawn, that man can come in contact with or use
        nature.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book i, ch. ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">54. &quot;As commonly used the word 'wealth ' is applied to anything having
        exchange value. But ... wealth, as alone the term can be used in political
        economy, consists of natural products that have been secured, moved, combined,
        separated, or in other ways modified by human exertion, so as to fit them
        for the gratification of human desires.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
        book i, ch ii. </font><font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">69. Demand for consumption is satisfied not from hoards of accumulated wealth,
            but from the stream of current production. Broadly speaking there can be
            no accumulation of wealth in the sense of saving up wealth from generation
            to generation. Imagine a man's satisfying his demand for eggs from the accumulated
            stores of his ancestors! Yet eggs do not differ in this respect from other
            forms of wealth, except that some other forms will keep a little longer,
          and some not so long.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">The notion that a saving instinct must be aroused before the great and more
            lasting forms of wealth can be brought forth is a mistake. Houses and locomotives,
            for example, are built not because of any desire to accumulate wealth, but
            because we need houses to live in and locomotives to transport us and our
            goods. It is not the saving, but the serving,, instinct that induces the
            production of these things; the same instinct that induces the production
          of a loaf of bread.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Artificial things do not save. No sooner are the processes of production
            from land complete than the products are on their way back to the land. If
            man does not return them by means of consumption, then through decay they
            return themselves. Mankind as a whole lives literally from hand to mouth.
            What is demanded for consumption in the present must be produced by the labor
            of the present. From current production, and from that alone, can current
          consumption be satisfied.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;Accumulated wealth&quot; is, in fact, not wealth at
            all in any great degree. It is merely titles to wealth yet to be produced.
            A share in a mining
          company, for example, is but a certificate that the owner is legally entitled
          to a proportion of the wealth to be produced in the future from a certain
          mine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Titles to future wealth may be both morally and legally valid. This is so
            when they represent past labor or its products loaned in free contract for
            future labor or its products; for example, a contract for the delivery of
            goods of any kind today to be paid for next week. or next month, or next
          year, or in ten years, or later.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">They may be legally but not morally valid. This is so when they represent
            the product of a franchise (whether paid for in labor or not) to exact tribute
            from future labor; for example, a franchise to confiscate a man's labor through
            ownership of his body, as in slavery, or a franchise to confiscate the products
          of labor in general through ownership of land.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Or they may be both legally and morally invalid, as when they are obtained
          by illegal force or fraud from the rightful owner.</font>... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

the Object &#8212; Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that industry is a good
thing, and that thrift is a good
thing; and there are some people who say that if a man be
industrious, and if a man he thrifty, he can easily accumulate
wealth. Whether that be true or not, industry is certainly a good
thing, and thrift is certainly a good thing. But what do we do if a
man be industrious? If he produces wealth enough, and by thrift
accumulates wealth at all, down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a
part of it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that that is stupid; that
we ought not by our taxes to
repress the production of wealth; that when a farmer reclaims a strip
of the desert and turns it into an orchard and a vineyard, or on the
prairie produces crops and feeds fine cattle, that, so far from being
taxed and fined for having done these things, we ought to be glad
that he has done it; that we ought to welcome all energy; that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">no man
can produce wealth for himself without augmenting the general stock,
without making the whole country richer. </span>We impose some taxes
for the
purpose of getting rid of things, for the purpose of having fewer of
the things that we tax. In most of our counties and States when dogs
become too numerous, there is imposed a dog tax to get rid of dogs.
Well, we impose a dog tax to get rid of dogs, and why should we
impose a house tax unless we want to get rid of houses? Why should we
impose a farm tax unless we want fewer farms? Why should we tax any
man for having exerted industry or energy in the production of
wealth? <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What do we do when we tax a
building? When a man puts up a
building by his own exertion, or it comes to him through the transfer
of the right that others have to their exertion, down comes the
community and says, virtually, you must give us a portion of that
building. For where a man honestly earns and accumulates wealth, down
come the tax-gatherers and demand every year a portion of those
earnings. Now, is it not as much an impairment of the right of
property to take a lamb as to take a sheep? To take 5% or 20%, as to
take 100%? We should leave the whole of the value produced by
individual exertion to the individual. We should respect the rights
of property not to any limited extent, but fully. We should leave to
him who produces wealth, to him to whom the title of the producer
passed, all that wealth. No matter what be its form, it belongs to
the individual. We should take for the uses of the community the
value of land for the same reason. It belongs to the community
because the growth of the community produces it.&nbsp; </small><small><a

Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being returned
to society in rent. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The failure of society to recapture the appropriate level of
land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.
The railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>The galleys that carried Caesar to Britain, the accoutrements of his legionaries,
      the baggage that they carried, the arms that they bore, the buildings that
      they erected; the scythed chariots of the ancient Britons, the horses that
      drew them, their wicker boats and wattled houses&#8211;where are they now?
      But the land for which Roman and Briton fought, there it is still. That
      British soil is yet as fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans.
      Generation
      after generation has lived on it since, and generation after generation
      will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference. <strong>The right to possess
      and to pass on the ownership of things that in their nature decay and soon
      cease to be is a very different thing from the right to possess and to pass
      on the ownership of that which does not decay, but from which each successive
      generation must live.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>To show how this difference between land and such other species of property
      as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for the vested rights
      of landholders, let me illustrate again.</strong></p>
  <p> Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a business of sailing the seas, capturing
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes.
    In this way he accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried.
    But let us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
    his wealth,
    but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs and so on, until
    at the present day this wealth or a part of it has come to a great-great-grandson
    of
    Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
    that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the shipmasters whom
    Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says: "This man's great-great-grandfather
    plundered my great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which
    have been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would have
    been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
    restore them." What would society answer?<br>
  </p>
  <p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with principles
    recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We cannot entertain such
    a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's great-great-grandfather robbed your
    great-great-grandfather, and that as the result of this wrong he has got
    things that otherwise might have come to you. But we cannot inquire into
    occurrences
    that happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to
    its own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the controversies
    of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless disputes and pretexts
    for dispute. What you say may be true, but somewhere we must draw the line,
    and have an end to strife. Though this man's great-great-grandfather may
    have
    robbed your great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into
    possession of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully, and
    we must take
    this peaceful possession, when it has been continued for a certain time,
    as absolute evidence of just title; for, were we not to do that, there would
    be
    no end to dispute and no secure possession of anything."</p>
  <p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the statute
    of limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> This is the reason why it is held &#8211; and as
      to most things held justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for
      a certain time cures all defects of title.</span></p>
  <p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
  <p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and profitable
    piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son, and so on, until
    the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has come to consider it the most
    natural thing in the world that his ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much
    plunder, whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
    great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to work. But
    at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having their ships sunk
    and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of trembling for their lives every
    time a sail lifts above the horizon, and they demand of society that piracy
    be stopped.</p>
  <p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed to the
    doctrine of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound to prevent
    any interference
      with the business that he had inherited, and that, if it wanted him to
    stop, it must buy him out, paying him all that his business was worth&#8211;that
      is to say, at least as much as he could make in twenty years' successful
    pirating, so that if he stopped pirating he could still continue to live
    in luxury off
      of the profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
  <p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be but one answer.
    We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd that his was a business to
    which the statute of limitations and the doctrine of vested rights did not
    apply; that because his father, and his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather
    pursued the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the plank,
    was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it. Society, we will all
    agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy and stop it at once, and that
    without getting a cent for stopping.</p>
  <p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his piratical business
    to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree that society ought to say that
    their purchase of the business gave them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
  <p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe, I do not
    ask what society would say.</p>
  <p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied that,
    under the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for a long time
    say what
      we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would all the Kidds loudly claim
    that to make them give up their business without full recompense would be
    a wicked
      interference with vested rights, but the justice of this claim would at
    first be assumed as a matter of course by all or nearly all the influential
    classes&#8211;the
      great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for the magazines, the
    eloquent clergymen, and the principal professors in the principal universities.
    Nay,
      even the merchants and sailors, when they first began to complain, would
    be so tyrannized and browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly
      think of more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there
    any
      one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and without
      compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being stigmatized as
    a reckless disturber and wicked foe of social order.</p>
  <p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such fools, then I
    appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
  <p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any people,
    became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to you the truth of
    what I say. ...</p>
  <p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is not long since
    the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly respectable business, affording
    as legitimate an opening for the investment of capital and the display of enterprise
    as any other. The proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous,
    then as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very Constitution
    bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law of the nation, adopted
    twelve years after the enunciation of the Declaration of Independence, declare
    that for twenty years the slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted?
    Such dominion had the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who
    had already proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a
