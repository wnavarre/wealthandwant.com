      <p><br>
            Are we all created equal? Do we all have the same birthright? Or are some
              of us somehow entitled to claim land, which every human being needs, and
              charge the rest of us rent for the use of that land?</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>It isn't that those who use land don't owe rent on it &#8212; they
        do. The question is, <em>to whom </em>do they (we!) owe it? Do we owe
        it to the individuals who have documents which say they own the land,
        or do
        we
              owe it to the
              community as a whole? We've been paying it to the landlord, and
        letting him keep it. Does this make sense? We're so used to it that we
        don't
        even think about it.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">What is the alternative? Instead of taxing wages, or sales,
      or buildings, collect the land rent from the holders of the land. Land
      rent varies widely.
            Agricultural land's rent is very low. The rent on urban land might
      be thousands, or as much as 100,000 times that of agricultural land. But
      it isn't the current owner, or the string of previous owners, who have
      made that urban site so valuable: it is all of us, by our presence and
      by our
      common spending. So why do we allow some to privatize it, as if they created
      it. Is heaven privatized? If we seek to create heaven on earth, shouldn't
      we all share equally in the natural creation?</div>

    <div align="left"><small>What I contend for is this: That
        it is a mistake to consider the
        Irish Land Question as a mere local question, arising out of conditions
        peculiar to Ireland, and which can be settled by remedies that can have
        but local application. On the contrary, I contend that what has been
        brought into prominence by Irish distress, and forced into discussion
        by Irish agitation, is something infinitely more important than any
        mere local question could be; it is nothing less than that question of
        transcendent importance which is everywhere beginning to agitate, and,
        if not settled, must soon convulse the civilized world &#8211; the question</small></div>

  <small> </small><li><small>whether, their political equality
conceded (for, where this has
not already been, it soon will be), the masses of mankind are to remain
mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for the benefit of a fortunate
few?</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>whether, having escaped from feudalism,
modern society is to pass
into an industrial organization more grinding and oppressive, more
heartless and hopeless, than feudalism?</small></li>
  <small> </small><li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>whether, amid
the abundance their
labor creates, the producers of wealth are to be content in good times
with the barest of livings and in bad times to suffer and to starve?</small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is involved in this Irish
Land Question is not a mere local matter
between Irish landlords and Irish tenants, but the great social problem
of modern civilization. What is arraigned in the arraignment of the
claims of Irish landlords is nothing less than the wide-spread
institution of private property in land. In the assertion of the
natural rights of the Irish people is the assertion of the natural
rights that, by virtue of his existence, pertain everywhere to man. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>... it is best that the truth be fully stated and clearly
recognized.
He who sees the truth, let him proclaim it, without asking who is for
it or who is against it. This is not radicalism in the bad sense
which so many attach to the word. This is conservatism in the true
sense.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What gives to the Irish Land
Question its supreme significance is
that it brings into attention and discussion &#8211; nay, that it forces
into attention and discussion, not a mere Irish question, but a
question of world-wide importance.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a most Christian city.
There are churches and churches.
All sorts of churches, where are preached all sorts of religions,
save that which once in Galilee taught the arrant socialistic
doctrine that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God; all save that
which once in Jerusalem drove the money-changers from the temple.
Churches of brown and gray and yellow stone, lifting toward heaven in
such noble symmetry that architecture seems invocation and benison;
where, on stained-glass windows, glow angel and apostle, and the
entering light is dimmed to a soft glory; where such music throbs and
supplicates and bursts in joy as once in St. Sophia ravished the
souls of heathen Northmen; churches where richly cushioned pews let
for the very highest prices, and the auctioneer determines who shall
sit in the foremost seats; churches outside of which on Sunday stand
long lines of carriages, on each carriage a coachman. And there are
white marble churches, so pure and shapely that the stone seems to
have bloomed and flowered &#8211; the concrete expression of a grand,
sweet thought. Churches restful to the very eye, and into which the
weary and heavy-laden can enter and join in the worship of their
Creator for no larger an admission fee than it costs on the Bowery to
see the bearded lady or the Zulu giant eight feet high. And then
there are mission churches, run expressly for poor people, where it
does not cost a cent. There is no lack of churches. There are, in
fact, more churches than there are people who care to attend them.
And there are likewise Sunday-schools, and big religious "book
concerns," and tract societies, and societies for spreading the light
of the gospel among the heathen in foreign parts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet, land a heathen on the Battery
with money in his pocket, and
he will be robbed of the last cent of it before he is a day older.
"By their fruits ye shall know them." I wonder whether they who send
missionaries to the heathen ever read the daily papers. I think I
could take a file of these newspapers, and from their daily
chroniclings match anything that could be told in the same period of
any heathen community &#8211; at least, of any heathen community in a
like state of peace and prosperity. I think I could take a file of
these papers, and match, horror for horror, all that returning
missionaries have to tell-even to the car of Juggernaut or infants
tossed from mothers' arms into the sacred river; even to Ashantee
"customs" or cannibalistic feasts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
do not say that such things are
because of civilization, or
because of Christianity. On the contrary, I point to them as
inconsistent with civilization, as incompatible with Christianity.
They show that our civilization is one-sided and cannot last as at
present based; they show that our so-called Christian communities are
not Christian at all.</span> I believe a civilization is possible in
which
all could be civilized &#8211; in which such things would be impossible.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But it must be a civilization based on
justice and acknowledging the
equal rights of all to natural opportunities. I believe that there is
in true Christianity a power to regenerate the world. But it must be
a Christianity that attacks vested wrongs, not that spurious thing
that defends them. The religion which allies itself with injustice to
preach down the natural aspirations of the masses is worse than
atheism.&nbsp; </span>... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> I say that all this poverty
and the ignorance that flows from
it is unnecessary; I say that there is no natural reason why we
should not all be rich, in the sense, not of having more than each
other, but in the sense of all having enough to completely satisfy
all physical wants; of all having enough to get such an easy living
that we could develop the better part of humanity. </b>There is no
reason why wealth should not be so abundant, that no one should think
of such a thing as little children at work, or a woman compelled to a
toil that nature never intended her to perform; wealth so abundant
that there would be no cause for that harassing fear that sometimes
paralyses even those who are not considered "the poor," the
fear that every man of us has probably felt, that if sickness should
smite him, or if he should be taken away, those whom he loves better
than his life would become charges upon charity. "Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin." <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I
believe that in a really Christian community, in a
society that honoured not with the lips but with the act, the
doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion to worry about
physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There is
enough and to spare.</span> The trouble is that, in this mad struggle,
we
trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all;
trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small><b>There is a cause for this
poverty; and, if you trace it down,
you will find its root in a primary injustice. Look over the world
today&#8212;poverty everywhere. The cause must be a common one. You
cannot attribute it to the tariff, or to the form of government, or
to this thing or to that in which nations differ; because, as deep
poverty is common to them all the cause that produces it must be a
common cause. What is that common cause? There is one sufficient
cause that is common to all nations; and that is the appropriation as
the property of some of that natural element on which and from which
all must live.&nbsp; </b>... <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"Thou shalt not steal." That
  means, of course, that we ourselves must not steal. But does it not
  also mean that we must not suffer anybody else to steal if we can help
  it?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
  suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we,
  all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime
  that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212; they
  are not to blame above anyone else, but we who permit them to monopolize land
  are also parties to the theft.</small>    </p>
  <p><small>The Christianity that ignores this social responsibility has
      really forgotten the teachings of Christ. Where He in the Gospels
      speaks of the judgment, the question which is put to the people is
      never, "Did you praise me?" "Did you pray to me?" "Did you believe this
      or did you believe that?" It is only this: "What did you do to relieve
      distress; to abolish poverty?" To those who are condemned, the Judge is
      represented as saying: "I was ahungered and ye gave me no meat, I was
      athirst and ye gave me no drink, I was sick and in prison and ye
      visited me not." Then they say, "Lord, Lord, when did we fail to do
      these things to thee?" The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye failed to do it
      to the least of these, so also did ye fail to do it unto me; depart
      into the place prepared for the devil and his angels."</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>On the other hand, what is said to the blessed is: "I was
      ahungered and ye gave me meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink, I
      was naked and ye clothed me, I was sick and in prison and ye visited
      me." And when they say: "Lord, Lord, when did we do these things to
      thee?" The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of
    these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Here is the essential spirit of Christianity. The essence of its
      teaching is not "Provide for your own body and save your own soul!" but
"Do what you can to make this world a better world for all!" It was a
      protest against the doctrine of "each for himself and the devil takes
      the hindermost!" It was the proclamation of a common fatherhood of God
      and a common brotherhood and sisterhood of men and women. This was why
      the rich and powerful, the high priests and the rulers persecuted
      Christianity with fire and sword. It was not religion (what in so many
      of our churches today is called religion) that pagan Rome sought to
    tear out &#8212; it was the doctrine of the equality of human rights!</small><br>
  </p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now imagine, when we men and women
of today go before that awful
bar, that there we should behold the spirits of those who in our time
under this accursed social system were driven into crime; of those
who were starved in body and mind; of those little children who, in
this city of New York, are being sent out of the world by thousands
when they have scarcely entered it &#8212; because they do not get
food enough, nor air enough; because they are crowded together in
these tenement districts under conditions in which all diseases rage
and destroy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Supposing we are confronted
with those souls, what will it
avail us to say that we individually were not responsible for their
earthly conditions? What, in the spirit of the parable of Matthew,
would be the reply from the Judgment seat? Would it not be: "I
provided for them all. The earth that I made was broad enough to give
them room. The materials that are placed in it were abundant enough
for all their needs. Did you or did you not lift up your voice
against the wrong that robbed them of their fair share in the
provision made for all?" ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People do not have a natural
right to demand employment of another, but they have a natural right,
an inalienable right, a right given by their Creator, to demand
opportunity to employ themselves. And whenever that right is
acknowledged, whenever the people who want to go to work can find
natural opportunities to work upon, then there will be as much
competition among employers who are anxious to get people to work for
them, as there will be among people who are anxious to get work.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Wages will rise in every vocation to the true rate of wages &#8212;
the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and in
a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now beginning to
look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and more ignorant age.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I remember &#8212; this man here remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the men
who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
conscience of the north &#8212; I well remember, as he well knows, and all
the older men and women in this audience will remember, how property in
human flesh and blood was defended just as private property in land is
now defended; how the same charges were hurled upon the men and women
who protested against human slavery as are now made against the men and
women who are intending to abolish industrial slavery.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We remember how some dignitaries and rich members of the
churches branded as a disturber, almost as a reviler of religion, any
priest or any minister who dared to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth &#8212;
that there never was and there never could be rightful property in
human flesh and blood.</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, it is now said that people who protest against this system,
which is simply another form of slavery, are people who propose
robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," they have made
"Thou shalt not object to stealing." When we propose to resume our own
again, when we propose to secure its natural right to every child that
comes into being, such people talk of us as advocating confiscation &#8212;
charge us with being deniers of the rights of property. The real truth
is that we wish to assert the just rights of property, that we wish to
prevent theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Chattel slavery was incarnate theft of the worst kind. That
system which made property of human beings, which allowed one person to
sell another, which allowed one person to take away the proceeds of
another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the tearing of the child from the
mother, and which permitted the so-called owner to hunt with
bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s tyranny &#8212; that form
of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the command, "Thou shalt not
steal," has been vindicated; but there is another form of slavery.

<br>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We see that the law of justice,
the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but
indeed the law of social life. We see that, if we were only to observe
it, there would be work for ail, leisure for all, abundance for all;
and that civilisation would tend to give to the poorest not only
necessaries, but all reasonable comforts and luxuries.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer when He told men that
if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right doing they might no
more worry about material things that do the lilies of the field about
their raiment; but that He was only declaring what political economy in
the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Labor associations of the nature of Trade Guilds or Unions are
necessarily selfish. By the law of their being they must fight for
their own hand, regardless of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore
the teaching of Christ that we should do to others as we would have
them do to us, which a true political economy shows is the only way to
the full emancipation of the masses; they must do their best to starve
workmen who do not join them; they must by all means in their power
force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8211; as the soldier in battle must shoot down
his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing ranks!</small><br>
<br>
<small>And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8211; a
fellow creature in all probability more pressed and starved than those
who so bitterly denounce him, and often with the hungry, pleading faces
of wife and child behind him. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>The worst evil
of poverty is not in the want of material
things, but in the stunting and distortion of the higher qualities. So,
in another way, the possession of unearned wealth stunts and distorts
what is noblest in man.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>The evil is not
in wealth itself &#8211; in its command over
material things: it is in the possession of wealth while others are
steeped in poverty; in being raised above touch with the life of
humanity; from its work and its struggles, its hopes and its fears, and
the kind sympathies and generous acts that strengthen faith in man and
trust in God!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>God&#8217;s commands cannot be evaded
with impunity. If it be His
command that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must
suffer. And they do!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>See the utter vacancy of the lives
of those who live for
pleasure; see the vices bred in a class who, surrounded by poverty, are
sated with wealth; see the pessimism that grows among them; see that
terrible punishment of ennui, of which the poor know so little that
they cannot understand it!</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When Christ told the rich young
man who sought Him to sell all
he had and to give it to the poor, He was not thinking of the poor, but
of the young man. And I doubt not that among the rich, and especially
among the self made rich, there are many who, at times at least, feel
keenly the folly of the riches and fear for the dangers and temptations
to which these expose their children. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the unduly rich are the
corollary of the unduly poor, so is
the soul-destroying quality of riches but the reflex of the want that
embrutes and degrades. The real evil lies in the injustice from which
unnatural possession and unnatural deprivation both spring.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This injustice can hardly be
charged on individuals or
classes. The existence of private property in land is a great social
wrong from which society at large suffers, and of which the very rich
and the very poor are alike victims, though at the opposite extremes.
Seeing this, if seems like a violation of Christian charity to speak of
the rich as though they individually were responsible for the
sufferings of the poor. Yet many do this while at the same time
insisting that land monopoly, the cause of monstrous wealth and
degrading poverty, shall not be touched. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A fugitive slave with the
bloodhounds of his pursuers baying
at his heels would in true Christian morals be held blameless if he
seized the first horse he came across, even though to take it he had to
knock down the rider, But this is not to justify horse-stealing as an
ordinary means of traveling.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When His disciples were hungry
Christ permitted them to pluck
corn on the Sabbath day. But He never denied the sanctity of the
Sabbath by asserting that it was, under ordinary circumstances, a
proper time to gather corn.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He justified David, who when
pressed by hunger committed what
ordinarily would be sacrilege, by taking from the temple the loaves of
proposition. But in this He was far from saying that the robbing of
temples was a proper way of getting a living.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The natural right which each man
has is not that of demanding
employment or wages from another man, but that of employing himself!
That of applying his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which
the Creator has in the land provided far all men!</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Were that storehouse open &#8211; as we
would open it &#8211; the demand
for labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold labor and
the man who bought it would become free exchangers for mutual
advantage, and all cause for dispute between workman and employer would
be gone.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then, all being free to employ
themselves, the mere
opportunity to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one
would work for another for less, all things considered; than he could
earn by working for himself, wages would necessarily rise to their full
value, and the relations of workman and employer be regulated by mutual
interest and convenience.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is the only way in which they
can be satisfactorily
regulated! <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, consider the moral aspect of
the present condition of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is &#8220;the question of the
hour,&#8221; the question that is
filling minds with painful apprehension? Reduced to its lowest
expression it is the poverty of men willing to work. And what is the
lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8211; for in
that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which
constitutes poverty.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, what is the prayer of
Christendom &#8211; the universal prayer;
the prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is
honoured; that ascends from the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome, and
that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian
mother has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is: &#8220;<b><i>Give
us this day our daily bread!</i></b>&#8221; Yet, where this prayer goes up,
daily and hourly, men lack bread! Why?
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is the answer, the only true
answer! <span style="font-weight: bold;">If men lack
bread, it is not that God has not done His part in providing it. If men
willing to labor are cursed with poverty, it is not that the
storehouse has failed, that the supply He has promised for the daily
wants of His children is not here in abundance.</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small>It
is, that, &#8220;impiously violating the benevolent intentions
of their Creator,&#8221; men have made land private property, and thus have
given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a
bountiful Father has made for all!&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a

Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IN 1881, before I had ever been in
Ireland or Dr. Nulty had ever
heard of me, he wrote <a
 href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">a
letter on the Land Question to the clergy and laity of the diocese of
Meath</a>. Dr. Nulty lays down precisely the principle that I have
endeavored to lay down here before you briefly, that there is a right
of ownership that comes from work, from production; that it is the
law of nature, the law of God, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>that all men should work; </small></li>
  <li><small>that what a man produces by his labor belongs to him; </small></li>
  <li><small>that the reservoir from which everything must come -- the
land
itself -- can belong to no man, and </small></li>
  <li><small>that its proper treatment is just as I have proposed to
let there
be security of possession and to let those who have special privileges
pay into the common fund for those privileges, and to use that fund for
the benefit of all. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dr. Nulty goes on to say what
every man who has studied this
subject will cordially endorse, that the natural law of rent -- that
law by which population increases the value of land in certain places
and makes it grow higher and higher -- that principle by which, as
the city grows, land becomes more valuable -- that that is to his
mind <span style="font-weight: bold;">the clearest and best proof, not
merely of the intelligence but
of the beneficence of the Creator</span>. For he shows clearly that
that is
the natural provision by virtue of which, if men would only obey
God's law of justice, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">if men would
only obey the fundamental maxim of
Christianity to do to others as they would be done to them: that by
virtue of that provision, as the advance of civilization went on, it
would be towards a greater and greater equality among men -- not a nod
to a more and more monstrous inequality.</span>&nbsp; <a

of Wealth Harm America</a> (excerpt from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp; (1883)</small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A civilization which tends to
concentrate wealth and power in
the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human
machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a
civilization is possible in which the poorest could have all the
comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons
and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies unthought
of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence that
will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are
already in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is,
yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of wealth-producing
forces. "Give us but a market," say manufacturers, "and we will
supply goods without end!" "Give us but work!" cry idle men. <strong>...</strong></small><strong>
</strong><br>
<br>
<small> The progress of civilization requires that more and more
intelligence be devoted to social affairs, and this not the
intelligence of the few, but that of the many. We cannot safely leave
politics to politicians, or political economy to college professors.
The people themselves must think, because the people alone can act.</small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;In a "journal of
civilization" a professed teacher declares
the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own
business. This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes
to those who, having fared well themselves, think everybody should be
satisfied. But the salvation of society, the hope for the free, full
development of humanity, is in the gospel of brotherhood -- the gospel
of Christ. Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more
the business of each; it 'binds all closer and closer together in
bonds from which none can escape. He who observes the law and the
proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes no interest in the
general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden under
foot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true Christian. Nor
is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder than
this. . . .&nbsp; ... <a

<small>Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The Single Tax: What It Is and
Why We Urge It</a> (1890)</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may expect
these
<small><small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. It would dispense with a
whole army of tax gatherers and other officials which present taxes
require, and place in the treasury a much larger portion of what is
taken from people, while by making government simpler and cheaper, it
would tend to make it purer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It would
get rid of taxes which necessarily promote fraud, perjury, bribery, and
corruption, which lead men into temptation, and which tax what the
nation can least afford to spare--honesty and conscience.</span> Since
land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is the most
readily ascertained of all values, the tax to which we would resort can
be collected with the minimum of cost and the least strain on public
morals. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>...&nbsp; These are the fundamental reasons for which we urge
the Single
Tax, believing it to be the greatest and most fundamental of all
reforms. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We do not think it will
change human nature. That, man can
never do; but it will bring about conditions in which human nature
can develop what is best, instead of, as now in so many cases, what
is worst.</span> </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It will permit such an enormous production as we can now
hardly conceive.
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It will secure an
equitable distribution. </span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>It will
solve the labor problem and dispel the darkening clouds which are now
gathering over the horizon of our civilization. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It will make
undeserved poverty an unknown thing. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It will check the
soul-destroying greed of gain. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It will enable men to be at least as
honest, as true, as considerate, and as high-minded as they would
like to be. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It will remove temptation
to lying, false, swearing,
bribery, and law breaking. </span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>It will open to all, even the poorest, the
comforts and refinements and opportunities of an advancing
civilization. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It will thus, so we reverently
believe, clear the way
for the coming of that kingdom of right and justice, and consequently
of abundance and peace and happiness, for which the Master told His
disciples to pray and work. It is not that it is a promising
invention or cunning device that we look for the Single Tax to do all
this; but it is because it involves a conforming of the most
important and fundamental adjustments of society to the supreme law
of justice, because it involves the basing of the most important of
our laws on the principle that we should do to others as we would be
done by.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The readers of this article, I may
fairly presume, believe, as I
believe, that there is a world for us beyond this. The limit of space
has prevented me from putting before them more than some hints for
thought. Let me in conclusion present two more:</small></p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 80px;"><small>1.
What would be the result in heaven itself if those who get there first
instituted private property in the surface of heaven, and parceled it
out in absolute ownership among themselves, as we parcel out the
surface of the earth? </small>
  <p><small>2. Since we cannot conceive of a heaven in which the equal
rights of God's children to their Father's bounty is denied, as we now
deny them on this earth, what is the duty enjoined on Christians by the
daily prayer: "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is
in heaven?"</small>&nbsp;<small> <a style="font-weight: bold;"

I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that honored, not
with the lips but with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion
to worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There
is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad struggle, we trample
in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all; trample it in the
mire while we tear and rend each other. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a></em> <br>

WHOSE fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make that
terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and the necessity
of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that it is the fault
of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring cholera to this country,
or the man who, having the power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort
to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty
kills more people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at the death
statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come quickest; see where it is
that the little children die like flies &#8212; it is in the poorer quarters.
And the man who looks with careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence;
the man who does not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty
of a crime. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime of Poverty</a></em><br>

<p>The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
    (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a> (1881) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small><b>Human Slavery Once Generally
        Accepted.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>Slavery is found to have existed, as a social institution, in
        almost all nations, civilised as well as barbarous, and in every age
        of the world, up almost to our own times. We hardly ever find it in
        the state of a merely passing phenomenon, or as a purely temporary
        result of conquest or of war, but always as a settled, established
        and recognised state of social existence, in which generation
        followed generation in unbroken succession, and in which thousands
        upon thousands of human beings lived and died. Hardly anyone had the
        public spirit to question its character or to denounce its excesses;
        it had no struggle to make for its existence, and the degradation in
        which it held its unhappy victims was universally regarded as nothing
    worse than a mere sentimental grievance.</small>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other hand, the justice of
the right of property which a
master claimed in his slaves was universally accepted in the light of
a first principle of morality. His slaves were either born on his
estate, and he had to submit to the labour and the cost of rearing
and maintaining them to manhood, or he acquired them by inheritance
or by free gift, or, failing these, he acquired them by the right of
purchase -- having paid in exchange for them what, according to the
usages of society and the common estimation of his countrymen, was
regarded as their full pecuniary value. Property, therefore, in
slaves was regarded as sacred, and as inviolable as any other species
of property.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Even Christians Recognised
Slavery.</b>
</small><br>
<small>So deeply rooted and so universally received was this conviction
that the Christian religion itself, though it recognised no
distinction between Jew and Gentile, between slave or freeman,
cautiously abstained from denouncing slavery itself as an injustice
or a wrong. It prudently tolerated this crying evil, because in the
state of public feeling then existing, and at the low standard of
enlightenment and intelligence then prevailing, it was simply
impossible to remedy it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus then had slavery come down
almost to our own time as an
established social institution, carrying with it the practical
sanction and approval of ages and nations, and surrounded with a
prestige of standing and general acceptance well calculated to
recommend it to men's feelings and sympathies. And yet it was the
embodiment of the most odious and cruel injustice that ever afflicted
humanity. To claim a right of property in man was to lower a rational
creature to the level of the beast of the field; it was a revolting
and an unnatural degradation of the nobility of human nature
itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That thousands upon thousands of
human beings who had committed no
crime, who had violated no law, and who had done no wrong to anyone,
should be wantonly robbed of their liberty and freedom; should be
deprived of the sacred and inalienable moral rights, which they could
not voluntarily abdicate themselves; should be bought and sold, like
cattle in the markets; and should be worked to death, or allowed to
live on at the whim or caprice of their owner, was the last and most
galling injustice which human nature could be called on to
endure.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The World's Approval Cannot
Justify Injustice.</b>
</small><br>
<small>To arrest public attention, and fix its gaze effectively on the
intrinsic character and constitution of slavery, was to seal its
doom; and its death knell was sounded in the indignant cry of the
great statesman who "denied that man could hold property in man."
Twenty millions of British money were paid over to the slave owners
as compensation for the loss of property to which they had no just
title, and slavery was abolished forever.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The Land of Every Country the Common Property of Its
People.</b>
</small><br>
<small>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but,
having created us, He bound Himself by that act to provide us with
the means necessary for our subsistence. The land is the only means
of this kind now known to us.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The land, therefore, of every
country is the Common Property of
the people of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who
made it, has transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Terram
autem dedit filiis hominum</span>."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, as every individual
in
that country is a creature and child
of God, and as all His creatures are equal in His sight, any
settlement of the land of a country that would exclude the humblest
man in that country from his share of the common inheritance would be
not only an injustice and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, would
be an impious resistance to the benevolent intentions of his
Creator. <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turning to their religious
heritage
for answers to severe injustice and suffering due to land monopoly
seems natural to liberation theologians and their followers. In the
Bible, the Promised Land is characterized by the "eminent domain" of
God. The abundance of the land comes with the recognition that the
earth is the Lord's. Otherwise, we continue in the Wasteland. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
same God who established communities has also in his providence
ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This not meant to suggest that
land monopolists and speculators have a corner on acquisitiveness or
the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh universal fact of human
nature. As a group, they are no more sinful than are people at large,
except to the degree that they knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at
removing the basis of exploitation. Many abide by the dictum: "If one
has to live under a corrupt system, it is better to be a beneficiary
than a victim of it."</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But they do not have to live
under a corrupt system; no one does. The profit motive can be channeled
in ways that are socially desirable as well as in ways that are
socially destructive. Let us give testimony to our faith that the earth
is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no
victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a

Joseph Fels: &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Fels.html">True Christianity and
My Own Religious Beliefs</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...
I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the community,
just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great
God-denying
crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia
11-1/2
acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
dollars in a few years. My fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
not created is a violation of the divine law. I believe that Justice
demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is my creed, my faith, my religion. Do you teach that, or
anything
like it, in your theological school? If not, why not? I have a right to
ask, since you have asked me for money. If you agree to my
propositions, but do not teach them, tell me why. If I am in error,
show me in what respect.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I am using all the money I have to teach my creed, my faith, my
religion, as best I can. I am using it as best I know how to abolish
the Hell of civilization, which is want and fear of want. I am using it
to bring in the will of our Father, to establish the Brotherhood of Man
by giving each of my brothers an equal opportunity to have and use the
gifts of our Father. Am I misusing that money? If so, why, and how?</small><br>
<br>
<small>If my teaching is wrong and contrary to true religion, I want to
know
it. I take it that if you are not teaching religion to its fulness, you
wish to know it. Am I correct?</small><br>
<br>
<small>What I teach may be criticized as mixing politics with religion,
but
can I be successfully attacked on that ground? Politics, in its true
meaning, is the science of government. Is government a thing entirely
apart from religion or from righteousness? Is not just government
founded upon right doing?</small><br>
<br>
<small>If my religion is true, if it accords with the basic principles
of
morality taught by Jesus, how is it possible for your school to teach
Christianity when it ignores the science of government? Or is your
school so different from other theological schools that it does not
teach the fundamental moral principles upon which men associate
themselves in organised government?... <a href="../docs/Fels.html"><span
