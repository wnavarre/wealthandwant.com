Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Neo-classical
Economics as a Stratagem Against Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse
today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds and
confines the florescence of older ones, like mesh wire around a
topiary. It took form a century ago, when Henry George and his reform
proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to
the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. Few people
realize to what a degree the founders of Neoclassical economics
changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George,
discomfiting his followers, and frustrating future students seeking
to follow his arguments. The stratagem was semantic: to destroy the
very words in which he expressed himself. Simon Patten expounded it
succinctly. "Nothing pleases a ...
single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories
... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast" (Patten
1908, p.219; Collier, 1979, p.270).<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> ...</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having taken shape in the
1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics
(henceforth NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by
Marshall, Seligman, and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went
through many reprintings each over a period of 40 years with few if
any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (1884) that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
Economy</span>. In this first edition of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be
found the general philosophy and
principles that have shaped all future editions, including that of
1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not until 1936 was there another
major "revolution," and that was
hived off into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained
there so as not to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization,
we will see in several instances, is the common NCE defense against
discordant data and reasoning.&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical economics makes an
ideal of "choice." That sounds
good, and liberating, and positive. In practice, however, it has
become a new dismal science, a science of choice where most of the
choices are bad. "TANSTAAFL"
(There Ain't No Such
Thing As A Free Lunch) is the slogan and shibboleth. Whatever you
want, you must give up something good. As an overtone there is even a
hint that what one person gains he must take from another. The theory
of gains from trade has it otherwise, but that is a heritage from the
older classical economists. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, in contrast, had a
genius for
reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling is far better than merely
compromising. He had a way of taking two problems and composing them
into one solution, as we lay out in detail infra. He took two polar
philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>, and
synthesized a plan
to combine the better features, and discard the worse features, of
each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
dilemmas and standoffs.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As policy-makers, neo-classical
economists present us with
"choices" that are too often hard dilemmas. They are in the tradition
of Parson Malthus, who preached to the poor that they must choose
between sex or food. That was getting right down to grim basics, and
is the origin of a well-earned epithet, "the dismal science." Most
modern neo-classicals are more subtle (although the fascist wing of
the otherwise admirable ecology movement gets progressively less so).
Here are some dismal dilemmas that neo-classicals pose for us today.
For efficiency we must sacrifice equity; to attract business we must
lower taxes so much as to shut the libraries and starve the schools;
to prevent inflation we must keep an army of unfortunates unemployed;
to make jobs we must chew up land and pollute the world; to motivate
workers we must have unequal wealth; to raise productivity we must
fire people; and so on.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The neo-classical approach is the
"trade-off." A trade-off is a
compromise. That has a ring of reasonableness to it, but it presumes
a zero-sum condition. At the level of public policy, such
"trade-offs" turn into paralyzing stand-offs, where no one gets
nearly what he wants, or could get. It overlooks the possibility of a
<span style="font-style: italic;">reconciliation</span>, or synthesis,
instead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In such a resolution, we are
not limited by trade-offs between fixed A and B: we get more of
both.&nbsp; </span>... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html"><span

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: A former Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation was given a grant
    recently to research the adequacy of land as a tax base. He's a professor
    at the University of California, Riverside, named Mason Gaffney, and he wrote
    a book titled, &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; Are you familiar
    with his work?</p>
  <p>JES: No.</p>
  <p>Q: I'll send you a copy of the book. Basically, he argues that the founders
    of neo-classical economics, which, as you know, is the paradigm taught in
    schools such as the University of Chicago, distorted the science of economics
    to protect vested interests. For example, Rockefeller money was spent to
    hire professors of economics with a view to their discrediting the ideas
    of Henry George. Did that happen?</p>
  <p>JES: My general impression is that most donors that give money to universities
    don't take a very strong view of [who should be on] the faculty. Sometimes
    it ends up on one side, sometimes on the other. It would have been unusual
    [at Chicago], but it could have happened there. What is striking about Chicago
    as a school of economic theory is that it's very conservative. One would
    have thought that Henry George was someone who would have been liked by &quot;Conservatives.&quot;</p>
  <p>Q: In that George wanted to reduce tax on the fruits of one's own labor?</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. And you want non-distortionary taxes, so I would have thought
    that every &quot;Conservative&quot; would be in Henry George's camp. Now,
    as far as I know, I'm one of the few people who keeps emphasizing that you
    ought to view Henry George in a broader way, to include natural resources.
    I didn't think that people thought about that a hundred years ago. But if
    they had, and maybe Rockefeller was smart &#8212; he realized that he obviously
    didn't want a tax on natural resources.</p>
  <p>Q: He wouldn't have wanted rents flowing from natural resources to go to
    the people rather than to him.</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, he obviously wouldn't like that perspective. But I don't know
    if that view was at that time recognized, and I just don't know whether he
    actively intervened at Chicago. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217;</p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. The role of land
    in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic growth
    was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo
    and Malthus. But the intervening years have seen land slide into a more peripheral
    status within economic analysis. Political economists working in the Marxian
    tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as
    the key to understanding the capitalist economy.1 <strong>Neo-classical economists
    typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of
    production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. </strong>Keynesian and post-Keynesian
    economists have also given little attention to land because typically their
    analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another thing libertarian
philosophers must paper over is the
rent-seeking that occurs in the creation of private tenures.&nbsp; They
avidly push privatization as a grand Panacea, but ignore the process of
privatization and its consequences.&nbsp; Private tenure is often
granted
under customs that make it a prize for occupying or fixing some capital
on land, and continuing to operate it with "due diligence" ("use it or
lose it").&nbsp; Premature investment, settlement and development are
frequent results, seriously distorting the allocation of land, labor
and capital and contributing to the "Congested Frontier" problem
(cf.&nbsp;
B-2.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>Some assets that are privatized in this way, dejure or defacto,
include</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>England's North Sea oil (where it is called "performance
bidding");</small></li>
  <li><small>water in the 17 western States of the USA, and four
western
provinces of Canada; the radio spectrum; licenses to pollute air
("offset rights," in EPA-speak);</small></li>
  <li><small>US farmland under Squatters' Rights (1841) and the
Homestead Act (1862);</small></li>
  <li><small>US and Canadian railroad land grants;</small></li>
  <li><small>fishing quotas;</small></li>
  <li><small>farm production and acreage quotas;</small></li>
  <li><small>cartel shares;</small></li>
  <li><small>utility franchises with duty-to-serve; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tolerance of
neo-classically-trained libertarian economists for
such distortions knows no bounds nor shame.&nbsp; A current example in
California is their push to convert conditional water licenses into
permanent property rights.&nbsp; They would give the present licensees
perpetual, alienable property not just in the water, but in past and
ongoing government subsidies to build and operate the water
distribution system.<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></big><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Consuming land means preempting its
time</span><br>
<br>
To consume most goods and services is to use them up.&nbsp; Land is not
used up.&nbsp; "Consuming" land must have some other meaning,
therefore, than the intuitive and common idea that consuming means
turning-to-waste.&nbsp; To consume land is rather to preempt its
service flow without impairing its substance.&nbsp; To consume land is
to occupy it for a time-slot, which may be as brief as beating a red
light or (rarely) as long as the pyramids last.&nbsp; After us life
goes on, on the land once left to us which we then leave to others.
"Time-sharing" was not invented by the holiday industry but is inherent
in the nature of land and life.<br>
<br>
How shall we measure land-consumption by owners, where no rent is
paid?&nbsp; Is it purely subjective?&nbsp; Does it vary with the
owner's mood and health?&nbsp; It is simpler than that, and fully
practicable.&nbsp; The essence of consuming land is preempting the
time-slot from others.&nbsp; Thus, holding land without using it, or
using it below capacity, is a form of consumption.&nbsp; The measure is
the market opportunity cost of land, i.e. the price times the interest
rate.<br>
<br>
Holding an urban site has been likened to holding a reserved seat at a
play, sporting event, or concert.&nbsp; The ticket holder properly
helps pay for the event, whether or not he is there to enjoy it.&nbsp;
As a result, very few paid customers fail to show up.&nbsp; Likewise,
people who pay cash rent for land seldom leave it vacant.&nbsp;
Doubtless if people paid regular cash taxes to hold land, they, too,
would consume (preempt) less.<br>
<br>
Proponents of "consumer taxation" almost universally overlook this
point.&nbsp; I am not aware of one who has proposed including
land-consumption in the tax base.&nbsp; Aaron and Galper, propounding a
"cash-flow tax," explicitly allow for letting each succeeding owner
expense land purchase, effectively exempting land rents from taxation
100%.<br>
<br>
Theirs, and other proposals, and consumer taxes actually imposed now
and in the past, bear heavily on the necessities of median
families.&nbsp; We deride the salt tax of the French ancien regime, and
of pre-Ghandian India.&nbsp; We recognize them as instruments of
tyranny and class warfare, even as we tolerate modem legislators who
impose comparable burdens on ourselves, and economists who rationalize
such taxes by belittling the necessities of life.<br>
<br>
Doing so, they compound the deception in the label "consumer
taxation".&nbsp; Much of what is taxed in the name of taxing consumers
is actually used for capital formation: human capital formation.&nbsp;
The same economists who say human beings are or contain capital, turn
around and tell us to tax the formation and maintenance of such
capital, by calling it "consumption'. Coupling this with their proposed
exemption of land-consumption we have the ultimate victory and
application of semantic cleansing.&nbsp; Inconstancy, thy name is --

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">Economics in
Support of Environmentalism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>The
Dereliction of Economists</b></small></small></small>
</small><br>
<small>There is another kind of fundamentalist, the private property
kind. The economics profession (my tribe) has, in recent years,
largely abdicated its proper role as an arbitrator and gone over
mainly to the side of private-property extremism. This is the
essential meaning of "Neo-classical Economics," which is the idiom of
most discourse in the field today, both in business and in the
profession.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How did economics get so twisted?
Don't blame Adam Smith, or David
Ricardo, or John Stuart Mill, or John E. Cairnes, or Knut Wicksell,
or Philip Wicksteed, sterling 19th Century writers. Rather, blame
J.B. Clark, Karl Marx, Richard T. Ely, Alvin Johnson, Frank Fetter,
Frank Knight, George Stigler, and a host of lesser figures who
gradually warped economics into its present form. How did they do
it? <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Private
property: from means to end</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a proper view of things, I
submit, private property is a means
to an end. It is not an end in itself; it needs a functional
rationale. The end is to get land put to the best use. All the
private land in the world was originally granted by some sovereign
public person or body, mainly for that purpose, not as a welfare
entitlement. Landowners and their lawyers have slyly, over time,
turned the means into an end, a fetish they endow with "sanctity."
This is a term they borrowed from absolutist medieval theology.
"Sanctity" means the quality or state of being holy or sacred, hence
inviolable. It means property may not be challenged, or even
questioned. It has become an end in itself, its own voucher. You're
not even supposed to think about it, it is above thought. Taboo!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neoclassical economics,
historically, marked the final, total
surrender of the profession to this fetish. The modern economist's
view runs something like this: "I pledge allegiance to the 14th
Amendment, and to the overinterpretation of private landowner
supremacy for which it has come to stand." It is ironic to recall
that Radical Republicans passed that Amendment, at a time when a
"Radical Republican" was one who favored freeing the slaves. The 14th
Amendment was designed to protect the rights of freedmen. As
interpreted now, the 14th Amendment means that The Emancipation
Proclamation itself was unconstitutional! Fortunately, no one has
brought that case - yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Neo-classical economists' view
of their proper role is rather
like that in The Realtor's Oath, which includes a vow "To protect the
individual right of real estate ownership." The word "individual" is
construed broadly to include corporations, estates, trusts, anonymous
offshore funds, schools, government agencies, institutions,
partnerships, cooperatives, the Duke of Westminster, the Sultan of
Brunei, the Medellin Cartel, Saddam Hussein, congregations,
Archbishops, families (including criminal families) and so on, but
"individual" sounds more all-American and subsumes them all. This is
a potent chant that stirs people to extremes of self-righteousness
and siege mentality when challenged.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The resemblance between
Neo-classical economics and the Realtor's
Oath is easier to understand when you learn that Professor Richard T.
Ely, founder of the modern discipline of Land Economics, was heavily
subsidized by the National Association of Real Estate Boards, the
utilities, the major landowning railroads, and others of like mind
and property interests.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When
it comes to violating property
rights, air pollution today is
perhaps the greatest invader and confiscator of property. </span>Where
do
economists stand? Once a few of them tried to say, following A.C.
Pigou, "let the polluter pay," and in parts of Europe they still do.
In our modern backward thinking here at home, however, it's not the
polluter who is invading the property of others, nor the human rights
of those not owning property. Rather, when you tell them to stop, the
government is invading their rights. The wage-earning taxpayers must
pay them to stop, else you are violating both the 14th Amendment and
the "Coase Theorem," a rationalization for polluting now dearly
beloved by Neo-classical economists.&nbsp; </small><small>... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b>
</small><br>
<small>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>one the continuing tradition of
Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>a second being the aggressive and
emerging school of Marxism, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the third a proposal for two-factor
economics being pressed largely by interests in America. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marxism was
never a major force in United States; <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
primary challenge to the
classical tradition came from what has since come to be known as
neo-classical economics.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly- established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
classical tradition of economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. </span>All

disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
classical economics, the definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. </span>Conflating land into capital allowed land
rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however, had
advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>There are many
indications that the paradigm that has dominated
orthodox economic theory for the past century, what has come to be
called neoclassical economics, is disintegrating.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 </span></small>This
has led many economics students, as well as others interested in the
power and promise this discipline holds, to look once more at the
genesis of its theory and to attempt reformulations of its basic
premises. Marxism has also ceased to be a viable alternative, perhaps
more due to the failure of its institutional applications than to the
failings of the theory itself. Only one other longstanding economics
tradition has survived continuing scrutiny and remains a recognizable
and venerable legacy to the present time. This is the tradition that
has come to be known as Georgism. The Georgist tradition has seen a
profound revival during the past decade and warrants a comparison with
other upstart economics frameworks that have reached the level of
separate identity.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2 ...</span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></small>The next
important step in
understanding Georgist economics is
recognition that each factor of production has its economic price: the
price of labor is wages, the price of capital is interest, and the
price of land is rent. When any of these prices are unpaid,
distortions
result in the economic equilibrium and problems become manifest in
other realms of nature and society. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
neoclassical economics
compensation for the use of labor and capital continue to be important
in the formulas and calculations employed to explain the economy. But
for neoclassical economics, David Ricardo&#8217;s &#8220;law of rent&#8221; is
essentially ignored and has be come for all practical purposes an
artifact in the history of economics.</span> Rent continues to exist of
course; it is simply uncollected, left in the hands of those who
maintain monopoly control of certain services of nature, adding to
their market value in ways that distort the balance of markets. Failure
to recognize the importance of land rent (sometimes called economic
rent) is for Georgists critical to an understanding of the problems of
contemporary economies and economic analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14 ... </span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>It
is far easier to outline the basic premises of Georgist economics
than it is to do so for the emerging field of ecological economics.
Georgism is a tradition that grew out of a clearly formed tradition of
19th century classical economics and has been refined further for the
past century. It was neoclassical economics that diverged from the
reigning orthodoxy. The differences between the classical tradition as
represented and defended by Henry George and the emerging neoclassical
school were vividly portrayed from their earliest divergence, even to
the staging of formal debates between George and the new orthodoxy&#8217;s
adherents. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">75</span></small>
In contrast, ecological economics along with other emerging heterodox
schools is itself very much a reaction to the neoclassical tradition&#8217;s
insensitivities and failures. The differences between ecological
economics and the floundering discipline of neoclassical economics are
as much by way of the former&#8217;s criticism of the latter as they are an
enunciation of clear starting points.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To be sure, neoclassical economics emerged gradually over a
period of
some fifty years, and only reached its heyday, one might argue, with
the arrival of Paul Samuelson. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Samuelson, the
MIT economist whose text has gone through some 16 editions and has
outsold all other text combined once said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who writes a
nation&#8217;s laws . . . if I can write its economics textbooks.&#8221; </span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">76</span></small> The
neoclassical position developed ever greater abstract mathematical
applications, with models ever more detached from &#8220;real world&#8221; market
forces. This system of analysis now has reached a point of questionable
utility due to its hermetic and Newtonian emulations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">77 </span></small>Little
by little, one premise and formula after another have been cast aside,
to a point now that there is a broad recognition among economic
theorists at least that the discipline faces an intellectual crisis.<small><span

enumerating further criticisms that have been
levied against neoclassical economic thinking, something that has been
done far better elsewhere than is possible here, suffice it to say that
some of the most compelling charges have been made by the ecological
economists.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">79</span></small>
The most trenchant one as explicated by economist Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen is its violation of the basic laws of physics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">80 </span></small>It
assumes a continuing draw-down of the earth&#8217;s store of energy, of which
there is, of course, only a finite amount. If the economy continues to
expand to include all elements of the earth, it will consume so many
resources, particularly energy resources, that ultimately life itself
is destroyed. One study calculated that if everyone in the world lived
at the level of the average American, three &#8220;earths&#8221; would be necessary
to accommodate us all. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">81</span></small> The
challenge, argue the ecological economists, is to structure economic
analysis and the economy itself in such a way that markets are
contained and that existence outside economic reach is respected and
preserved. Whereas other studies of the environment within the
framework of conventional neoclassical economics attempt to price
nature in a way that its value is assured, ecological economists work
from the conviction that such an approach is questionable if not
futile, as it can never achieve any accurate and reliable market values
for such existence.<small><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic
analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Faced with the obvious growth of
environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivialize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The legitimate goals of

to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that

Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Introduction:
The Power of Neo-classical Economics <br>
</a> </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse
today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds and
confines the florescence of older ones, like mesh wire around a
topiary. It took form a century ago, when Henry George and his reform
proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to
the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. Few people
realize to what a degree the founders of Neoclassical economics
changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George,
discomfiting his followers, and frustrating future students seeking
to follow his arguments. The stratagem was semantic: to destroy the
very words in which he expressed himself. Simon Patten expounded it
succinctly. "Nothing pleases a ...
single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories
... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George believed economists were
recasting the discipline to refute
him. He states so, as though in the third person, in his last book,
<b><i>The Science of Political Economy</i></b> (George, 1898,
pp.200-209). George's self-importance was immodest, it is true.
However, immodesty may be objectivity, as many great talents from
Frank Lloyd Wright to Muhammed Ali and Frank Sinatra have displayed.
George had good reasons, which we are to demonstrate. George's view
may even strike some as paranoid. That was this writer's first
impression, many years ago. I have changed my view, however, after
learning more about the period, the literature, and later events.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having taken shape in the
1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics
(henceforth NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by
Marshall, Seligman, and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went
through many reprintings each over a period of 40 years with few if
any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (1884) that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
Economy</span>. In this first edition of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be
found the general philosophy and
principles that have shaped all future editions, including that of
1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not until 1936 was there another
major "revolution," and that was
hived off into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained
there so as not to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization,
we will see in several instances, is the common NCE defense against
discordant data and reasoning. After that came another 40 years of
Samuelson's "neoclassical synthesis." J.B. Clark's treatment of rent,
dating originally from his obvious efforts to refute Henry George
(see below), "has been followed by an admiring Paul Samuelson in all
of the many editions of his Economics" (Dewey, p.430).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Clark's capital theory "... gives
the appearance of being
specially tailored to lead to arguments for use against George"
(Collier, 1979, p.270). "The probable source from which immediate
stimulation came to Clark was the contemporary single tax discussion"
(Fetter, 1927, p.142). "To date, capital theory in the Clark
tradition has provided the basis for virtually all empirical work on
wealth and income" (Dewey, 1987, p.429; cf. Tobin, 1985). Later
writers have added fretworks, curlicues and arabesques beyond
counting, and achieved more isolation from history, and from the
ground under their feet, than in Patten's dreams, but all without
disturbing the basic strategy arrived at by 1899, tailored to lead to
arguments against Henry George.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To most modern readers, probably
George seems too minor a figure
to have warranted such an extreme reaction. This impression is a
measure of the neo-classicals' success: it is what they sought to
make of him. It took a generation, but by 1930 they had succeeded in
reducing him in the public mind. In the process of succeeding,
however, they emasculated the discipline, impoverished economic
thought, muddled the minds of countless students, rationalized
free-riding by landowners, took dignity from labor, rationalized
chronic unemployment, hobbled us with today's counterproductive tax
tangle, marginalized the obvious alternative system of public
finance, shattered our sense of community, subverted a rising
economic democracy for the benefit of rent-takers, and led us into
becoming an increasingly nasty and dangerously divided
plutocracy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The present paper purports to
identify the elements of
<b>Neo-Classical Economics (NCE)</b> that were planted there to sap
and confound George, and show how they continue to warp, debase and
vitiate much of the discipline called economics. Once a paradigm is
well-ensconced it becomes a power in itself, a set of reflexes to
sort the true and false. Any exception spoils the web of
interpretation through which art seeks to make human experience
intelligible. Only the young, the brave, the energetic, the sincere
and the skeptical can break off such fetters. This work is addressed
and dedicated to them. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Thus, to the rent-taker,
the typical college trustee or regent,
George's ideas remained a real and present danger over several
decades: the very decades when neo-classical economics was spreading
through the academic clerisy.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> With
the development of direct
democracy, open primaries, the secret ballot, direct election of U.S.
Senators, the Initiative, Referendum, and Recall, and the like, crude
vote-buying such as prevailed in the late 19th Century would no
longer dominate the electorate. Mind-control became the urgent need;
NCE was the tool. ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    My choice was to explore a tradition of economics and tax policy that I had
      discovered toward the end of my Commission service: the philosophy of Henry
      George. In the summer of 1993, I flew to Los Angeles to attend the annual
      conference of the Council of Georgist Organizations; I had become fascinated
      with these, to me, totally new ideas. I have counted myself a Georgist
      ever since. Never in the course of ten years reading and discussion of
      New York's tax policy options did anything even close to this perspective
      cross the horizon. And it is fair to assume that the staffers on the Commission
      today &#8211; it still exists &#8211; have no inkling of what narrow perspective
      they work from. Even with ample evidence that the framework of neoclassical
      economics on which most of the contemporary American tax system rests is
      collapsing, tax professionals have carried on with little awareness of
      its pitfalls. Alternate schools of economics are quickly growing in many
      quarters &#8211; very frequently outside of conventional university economics
      departments. There is even ample evidence now that the still prevailing
      neoclassical economic paradigm can be shown to violate the laws of physics!4
      Professional tax literature, however, shows little evidence of being aware
      of any of this.</p>

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> Our
motor-vehicle-dependent and urban sprawl
configurations can be explained by powerful interests continually
pressing for policies to make us so. One might even conclude that the
decision to drive on the right side of the road was equally as much a
defining moment. </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>15 This is an untold
story. A trial was held in a Chicago federal
court in 1949, resulting in an indictment of GM, Firestone, Standard
Oil, Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks among others. Their crime
was in forming a holding company called National City Lines which
proceeded in the preceding decade to buy up the public transportation
services in dozens of US cities, and then scrapping them so that
people would then become more automobile dependent. The corporations
were fined $5,000 each, and the CEOs of each one $1. See United
States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 93rd Congress, 2nd
Session, &#8220;American Ground Transport: A Proposal for
Restructuring the Automobile, Truck, Bus, and Rail Industries,&#8221;
by Bradford C. Snell, February 26, 1974 (Washington: US Government
Printing Office, 1974); and Jonathan Kwitney, &#8220;The Great
Transportation Conspiracy,&#8221; Harper&#8217;s Magazine, February,
1981.

<small>And I hope that you will forgive me for mentioning another great
conspiracy in American history, the subject of my <a
 href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">Torch
presentation about four years ago</a>. That story recounted how the
American railroad industry, in collusion with the banks, induced the
founders of the American economics profession to change definitions and
formulas so that they would be relieved of taxation on their land
holdings and speculation would be rewarded.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> This
dividing line
between classical and neoclassical economics is responsible I believe
for many of our economic problems today &#8212; economic cycles, an
inequitable
tax structure, poverty and unemployment, urban sprawl and the gutting
of urban centers. Only now is this economic ideology, almost sacrosanct
for a century, falling apart and seen for what it is. </small><small>... <a href="../docs/Batt_FOTSS.html"><span
