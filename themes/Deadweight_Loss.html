A Plea to Public Economists</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Microeconomics textbooks explain
the deadweight loss from
taxation. They explain how the loss is lower with a more inelastic
supply and demand. Professors have given thousands of classroom
lectures showing that if the supply curve were perfectly vertical,
there would be no deadweight loss. But they usually end the discussion
by saying, &#8220;and so it is good to try to put such taxation on goods that
exhibit relative inelasticity in supply or demand.&#8221; Some textbooks go
on to say that, because the supply of land is fixed, the taxation of
land rent has no excess burden. A few books point out that Henry George
proposed such taxation. None that I have seen point out that Adam Smith
and John Stuart Mill did, too.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Tideman et al (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain (measured
in real
dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land as could be
financed by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion or
14% of NDP in 2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even if
only a fraction of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes
we know today to a geo-rent tax, the efficiency gains could be really
substantial.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The elasticity insight remains compartmentalized. In public
finance
textbooks, when the discussion turns to tax policies, the insight is
rather neglected, and the idea of taxing land value is usually nowhere
to be found. It is as though there were some medicine available that we
know cures cancer, yet nobody takes it and no doctor prescribes it.
Economists who study irrational behavior should take note.&nbsp; <a

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Even a relatively flat income tax imposes what economists call a &#8220;deadweight
      loss&#8221; or &#8220;excess burden&#8221; on society. Taxes on productive
      activity increase the price of labor or goods beyond economic costs, and
      so reduce the quantity provided. This reduction in production, income,
      and investment
      is a misallocation of resources. Resources are wasted because they do not
      go to where they are most wanted. We can reduce this excess burden by reducing
      taxes, but changing the type of tax can also reduce this deadweight loss.
      Economists
      recognize that if we tap for public revenue a resource whose quantity is
      fixed, the excess burden disappears. The tax does not reduce the supply
      and does not
      increase prices. ... </p>
  <p>In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and
    Poverty</span> (1879), his most important book, Henry George contended the ideal
    tax would most closely conform to the following conditions, similar to those
    of Smith:</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. That the tax bears as lightly as possible
      upon production, minimizing the excess burden or deadweight loss.<br>
      2. That the revenues be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly
      as may be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as
      little as possible in addition to what it yields the government.<br>
      3. That it be certain and visible, so as to give the least opportunity for
      tyranny or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to
      lawbreaking and evasion on the part of the taxpayers.<br>
      4. That it be equitable, giving no citizen an arbitrary advantage or privilege,
      and in being consistent with moral principles.<small> ...</small></div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Impact on
    production<br>
    <br>
    </span>It is widely understood that when something is taxed, we get less
    of it. As discussed above, this reduction in labor, production, and investment
    is called
    the &#8220;excess burden&#8221; or &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; of taxation.
    Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes discourage
    consumption, capital gains taxes discourage investment, and real property
    taxes discourage
    building and improving property. Those taxes make the asset or activity more
    costly, which then reduces the
    quantity bought of the thing being taxed. <br>
    <br>
    What makes land different is that its supply is fixed, and it is independent
    of human action. When land value or rent is tapped for public revenue, the land
    does not shrink, flee, or hide. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q46. How can it be possible that speculative land values cause business
      depressions when, as any business man will tell you, the whole item of
      land value &#8212; whether ground rent or interest on purchase money &#8212; is
      one of the smallest items in every business?</em><br>
A. You overlook the fact that the item of speculative rent is the only item which
the business man does not get back again. The cost of his goods, the expense
of clerk hire, the rent of his building, the wear and tear of implements, are
all received back, in the course of normal business, in the prices of his goods.
Even his ground rent, to the extent that it is normal (i.e., what it would be
if the supply of land were determined alone by land in use, and not affected
by the land that is held out of use for higher values), comes back to him in
the sense that his aggregate profits are that much greater than they would be
where ground rent was less. But the extra ground rent which he is obliged to
pay, in consequence of the abnormal scarcity of land, is a dead weight; it does
not come back to him. Therefore, even if infinitesimal in amount, as compared
with the other expenses of his business &#8212; and that is by no means admitted &#8212; it
is the one expense which may break a thriving business down. Besides, it is not
alone the ground rent paid by the business man for his location that bears down
upon his business prosperity; the weight of abnormally high land values in general
presses upon business in general, and by obstructing the flow of trade forces
the weaker business units to the wall. It is not altogether safe to deduce general
economic principles from the ledgers of particular business houses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
  <p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
    course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax.
    Most basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form,
    and they constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of
    any particular tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such
    principles but little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless
    of ideology or government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency,
    equity, administrability, simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax
    theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or all of
    these criteria: ... </p>
  <p><strong>Tax efficiency</strong> is much like tax neutrality, and is the
    measure of how much shifting of behavior it imposes, resulting in what is
    called &quot;excess burden,&quot; or &quot;deadweight loss&quot; on the economy.
    Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes are those that are shifted
    little if at all. Because the elasticities (a technical word for the slope
    of supply and demand curves) of each are very different, a tax on land values
    and a tax on improvement values have very contrastive effects on economic
    choices. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity is the best
    way of assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is another way
    of saying fixed supply. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This means that taxing away land
rent more relieves it from circulating
through labor and capital, allowing those factors in turn to be more
productive. Significantly, perhaps most importantly, the collection of
land rent, on account of its inelasticity, incurs no deadweight loss
like tax levies on labor and capital. The economy thus functions more
efficiently -- i.e. with less drag and friction.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Lest one believe that this excess burden, or so-called
deadweight loss,
is a negligible drag on the economy, studies show just the opposite.
One study calculates that it was equal to about 20 percent of the total
US economy in the mid-1990s, annually at least one trillion dollars in
lost output.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(23)</span></small>
Put another way, a well designed efficient revenue structure would
allow productivity to rise by that amount and effectively make our
income that much higher. For Great Britain, the comparable figure was
shown to be &pound;400 billion annually.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Deadweight loss is a concept understood by economists but not by
the
general public. But this is likely to change as discussion about the
merit of various taxation approaches is presented to the public.
Nations in the European Community are now required to publish their
calculations about the deadweight loss of the various tax schemes being
reviewed, precisely because of the recognition of its importance as a
factor of production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(24) </span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The one kind of tax where there is
no deadweight loss whatsoever is
that imposed upon an base with inelastic supply. Since land and some
other elements of nature cannot be increased in quantity resulting in a
completely vertical supply curve, no inefficiency is incurred by such a
tax. Consider two cases of a tax commonly found worldwide on real
estate. Because a real property tax is actually two taxes from the
standpoint of economic dynamics -- the tax on the land component and
the tax on the improvement component, each is considered here as a
separate case. In the first case, the tax on the land component alone
is illustrated. In the other case, the tax on the improvement component
(i.e. the building) is shown. What happens?<br>
<br>
The tax on land alone is completely capitalized in the market value of
the land parcel and is not passed forward to the tenant. This is
important, because when the roughly 1/3 of all American households that
rent rather than own their own homes are removed from the burden of
property taxation, it has the effect of making the land tax far more
progressive. Those land parcels that do pay taxes are split between
residential and non-residential titleholders. Even though the
residential households are likely to constitute the overwhelming number
of parcels in the tax base, they are likely to bear only about half the
taxes paid, the remaining share borne largely by commercial sites.
Agricultural parcels may in some instances represent a large area of
land, but it is likely to be of far lower market value and represent
less than five percent of the revenue paid. The land component of a tax
on real property then is actually highly progressive.<small> ... </small><a

Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<p><strong>The Failure to Tax Rent</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The performance of economies freighted by experience with conventional taxes
      is much reduced, as has been widely acknowledged. One Harvard study estimated
      that taxes on income exert a deadweight loss equal to a third of the amount
      that is collected, half if payroll taxes are included.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> Sales
      taxes are equally as onerous. But taxing land, due to its fixed (inelastic)
      supply, has zero burden; it therefore has no encumbrance or drag on economic
      activity whatsoever. By reducing all the taxes on labor and capital and instead
      shifting the burden to various forms of land as a revenue base, it is possible
      not only to garner sufficient income for government programs but to relieve
      the market from the friction that slows its performance. Cities then get a
      double dividend by shifting to a land tax: downtaxing any form of labor and
      capital frees up its potential; uptaxing land value by the recovery of rent
      prompts its more intensive use. Revenue yield could even be increased in such
      a tax regime without much additional burden on homes. This is because underused
      landsites in the urban cores would feel the greatest increases.</p>
  <p>It should be further noted that wherever tax burdens are first incurred they
      are ultimately shifted through the economy until they come out of economic
      rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> By their initial
      imposition on other factors of production, however, they encumber the performance
      of markets and foster inequities among populations that is both inefficient
      and unjust. This is not difficult to explain: labor is responsive to the forces
      of market location, even if not always in the short run. People are always
      free to locate where burdens are less onerous, thus avoiding efforts to collect
      taxes when their labor is so targeted. Capital is even more mobile, especially
      so in the age of contemporary communication and wired transfers. By taxing
      capital a municipality is insuring that its investment base will be reduced.
      Only locations, and the rent that attaches to them, cannot be moved and are
      beyond escaping the reach of taxation. One can't take one's land to Cancun
      or Bermuda. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>In addition, a tax on site value (that is, the collection of economic rent)
      restores moral principle to tax theory. By collecting rent on that value
    that is generated by the collective activity of the community, it offers
    the opportunity
      to relieve tax burdens on value that is generated by individual effort.
    Put another way, any value that individuals create by their own bodies and
    minds
      is left for them to keep; that which is socially created value is recovered
      by the community to pay for its collective purposes. &quot;Tax what you take,
      not what you make,&quot; is one way to say it. &quot;Tax bads, not goods,&quot; or &quot;Tax
      waste, not work,&quot; is another way. At the heart of this approach is
      a very profound message: The earth is the common heritage of humanity;

worker (16% of NDP) in the first year, rising to $17,800 (23.7% of NDP)
after 20 years for the most productive tax reform, which involves

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, <strong>the failure to
    recover the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive
    activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">34. &#8220;Deadweight loss is the loss of producer&#8217;s or consumer&#8217;s
        surplus stemming from the price of a good being higher than marginal
      cost or to a tax that increases the cost. A lower quantity is purchased
      than would
        be the case without a tax or under ideal conditions, such as the elimination
        of artificial barriers to entry. (Fred E. Foldvary, Dictionary of Free-Market
        Economics. Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishers, 1998. p. 103.) The
      attachment of economic rent to land sites means that a market of less than
      perfect competition
        exists, thereby engendering deadweight loss.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
