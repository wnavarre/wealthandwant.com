</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Speculation in foreign currencies has reached astronomical
dimensions,
with professionals like George Soros becoming billionaires in the
process. But what wealth do they create in all of this? The fact of the
matter is that they get something for nothing - and their unearned
profits are orders of magnitude more than an ordinary working person
could possibly save in a lifetime, all for a few hours of playing the
market!</small><br>
<br>
<small>If the foreign currency scene was just like a casino in which
players
bet amongst themselves, then ordinary folk could not complain. But
that's not the case at all, which is why it's so lucrative. Some of the
unwitting downline losers are taxpayers, ordinary consumers, and small
investors in the share market and superannuation funds.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BIG BULLY-BOYS!</span></small><br>
<small>Furthermore, in an age of increasing globalisation, when
currency
speculators are so big and influential that they can manipulate the
very markets in which they're playing, they can sway national economies
at their whim. That the foreign exchange market is now so massive as to
be, in itself, a source of increasing instability in the economic world
is reason enough to clamp down on it. But the big reason, it may be
argued, is plain ethical: to reap where you don't sow means that, for
every million that goes into a speculator's bank account, some other
people somewhere are going to have to produce a million dollars worth
of wealth for which they will not get paid.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The fact that this outrageous form of legalised robbery can have
persisted for so long without any preventative action being taken by
governments (except, perhaps, in Malaysia) is disturbing to say the
least. And, when a fairly effective remedy has long been proposed, it
becomes doubly disturbing.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The way speculators have been able to profit until now is by
feeding on
economic instability and its resulting currency fluctuations. The odds
are with them that they can make a small, profitable gain in each of
many transactions, but do so in massive enough dimensions as to make
hefty profits. The proposed remedy is the so-called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tobin tax</span>,
whereby a very modest (about 0.2 - 0.5%) tax would apply to the approx.
$1.8 trillion that crosses borders every day. The revenues from the tax
could fund sustainable development programs, peacekeeping activities
and the like.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW IT WORKS</span></small><br>
<small>The Tobin tax would be enough to make nearly all speculative
dealings
unprofitable, as well as to alleviate currency instability and related
financial crises caused by the immense present levels of foreign
exchange trading. This measure would have little effect on ordinary,
legitimate transactions. It has to be said, however, that a few
Geonomists argue against the Tobin tax, emphasising how the ability to
gain ordinate power and to manipulate exchange rates would largely be
solved when the land issue is addressed. In any case, others criticise
it as it would penalise and obstruct non-speculative financial
transactions.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Windfall profits of huge proportions are also made in the share
and
commodities markets. In a truly free and fair market, the share market
plays a useful role in bringing enterprises and investors together for
their mutual benefit. But purely speculative profits are unearned in
the sense that the profit-maker has created no wealth, and again some
other mugs, in the end, have to indirectly pay for this.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DISTINCTION</span></small><br>
<small>The solution lies in distinguishing between these speculators
and
long-term investors. The latter are looking for a safe place to invest
and a fair rate of return in the medium and long term. Something
similar to the Tobin tax might do the job, in that a modest tax would
neither deter genuine investors nor greatly diminish their returns in
the long run. But it would be enough to deter parasitic speculators
primarily seeking short-term profits.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To some extent, the opportunity to make quick bucks exists
because of
speculative opportunities in the land "bubble" market and the
consequent boom-bust economic cycles fuelled by land monopoly
capitalism. The whole issue of boom-bust cycles deserves its own
section.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
think in principle it's a good idea to tax unimproved land, and
particularly capital gains (windfalls) on it. Theory says we should try
to tax items with zero or low elasticity, and those include sites."</span>

economics&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
