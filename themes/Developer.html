</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Like the rest of the universe, US
cities keep expanding. Some time before the
universe begins to contract, American metro
regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck
suburbia back into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most
fundamental forces in the world - money.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of
downtown.
The usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our
present dependency on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to
bring people back.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Local governments have begun to modify
the profit motive. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rather than meekly
pick up the
ever-rising tab for expanding the infrastructure, some
localities now charge developers a portion of this
cost.</span> While this move may stymie development at the
edge, what&#8217;s
needed is something to draw
development into the
urban core.
</small><br>
<br>
<small> Without spending a penny of subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small> If the property tax is a
centrifugal force that
flings structures
outward, its opposite is
a land levy, a centripetal
force that pulls development inward.
To pay this
charge, owners try to put their
parcels to better use.
"Owners of the most valuable sites,
paying the most,
try hardest," explains Tom Gihring, a
Seattle-based
consultant.. "Since the most valuable
lots lie about the
center, it is the center which draws development." In-fill
happens.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The world looks different to owners
dozing at the wheel,
waiting for land values to rise.
Title-holders keeping
prime downtown sites vastly
underutilized "now pay
only, say, $25,000 per year in
property tax for a half
block," figures <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Dr. Mason Gaffney</a>
of
the University of
California at Riverside. "Post-PTS
(property tax shift),
these owners of parking lots and
abandoned
warehouses might have to part with
three times that
amount each year." At $75,000 per
annum, no longer
could they afford to let prime sites
lie relatively idle.
"They'll put their land to uses that
generate much more
revenue than does an empty building or
car-covered
lot," adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy
building
apartments, stores, offices, schools,
theaters, mixing
all uses together to maximize their
return."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Post-PTS, would these speculators
turned developers
find customers? Or would potential
customers continue
to set up shop and home out in the
cheaper 'burbs?
Many house-hunters are drawn to where
all the
amenities are in walking distance.
Many shopkeepers
locate where people walk about. Other
businesses
collect themselves close to their
suppliers and
customers. There are plenty of takers
for new
downtown development.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> At least that's what land values tell
us. Land values
merely reflect the desirability of
locations. The more
people want on, the more they must
pay. The lots that
people are willing to pay the most for
are the heart of
the city.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small> As does nature, her
defenders might also
want to abhor a vacuum.
"Letting one city block lie
fallow means paving
over many suburban
acres," calculates Gaffney, consultant
to Alaska on oil
royalties. "Conversely, using one
block intensely means
many outlying acres need not be used
at all." ...</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Might the PTS work too well? Might it
spur edge-to-edge
development, leaving no lot unbuilt?
"While each owner
may want to build, the community may
prefer open
space and would buy the owner out,"
says Batt, a
retired professor. Pittsburgh, PA,
taxes land six times
more than buildings. The city
converted its most
valuable location, the Golden Triangle
where the three
rivers meet, into a park without
developer resistance or
an agonizing grassroots effort.
Pittsburgh also renewed
itself without federal subsidy and
enjoys the lowest
housing costs and crime rate of any
major US city.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> In New York, the city council keeps
Manhattan&#8217;s Central
Park unbuilt not because Greens rule
the Big Apple but
because property values overall are
higher with the park
than with luxury condos on the site.
Land value is at its
maximum when land use is at its
optimum - mixed use
including non-use. Batt adds, "the
higher land value is,
the more revenue there is for public
benefit. Limiting a
locality&#8217;s funding sources to
land value puts
government squarely on the side of the
land&#8217;s health."&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra

simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conventional property tax,
one taxing both land values and
improvement values, is analogous to a train with an engine at each end.
The tax on land value fosters improvement on the parcels with the
highest market and social value, while the tax on structures
discourages that very same thing. No wonder it is that economic
activities is stymied most in the urban centers and manifests itself in
areas where the least imposition of all has taken hold. As scholar
Jessica Matthews once put it,</small><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a now
familiar sequence, developers
reach for the cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is
left to fill in behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage
systems and schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and
schools are left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that
marches steadily outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside
the moving edge. Because residential development can't meet the public
bills, local governments compete for commercial investment with tax
discounts that deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes
then rise, providing an incentive for new development. Years of such

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Jessica Matthews, now with the

recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a now familiar

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Years of such leap-frogging

occupancy were charged to landholders, the reward of (and incentive

speculators would be transferred to users. Users would employ more
labor and engender more capital development instead of seeing it
locked up in wasted space.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Absent adequate taxation the
regions at the periphery are the
first developed, just as Ms. Matthews observes.</small></p>

now coming to recognize its
responsibility for what it has wrought. Economists are coming to
recognize the costs of sprawl, and studies show how astonishingly
inefficient the suburban lifestyle is. One review of the literature
on the subject of comparative development costs published by the
Urban Land Institute revealed that "houses built in sprawling
developments may cost 40 to 400 percent more to serve than if they
were located close to major facilities, were clustered in contiguous
areas, and incorporated a variety of housing types."&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Leapfrogging,
floating value, and compensation</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The environmental damage from
those attitudes might not be so bad
were it not for leapfrogging, urban disintegration, and floating
value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging is when
developers jump over the next eligible
lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there.
</span>This has been a problem in expanding economies ever since cities
emerged from within their ancient walls and stockades, but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in our
times and our country it has gone to unprecedented extremes, with
subsidized superhighways and universal auto ownership and truck
shipping.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred
Gobar, savvy real estate
consultant from Placentia, has
recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
miles). </span>That would be at a density of 3625 people per square
mile, or
5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">He
is not being stingy with land,
at 3625 persons per square mile.</span>
The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
mile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">On
Manhattan's upper East Side they
pile up at over 100,000 per
square mile. </span>They do not crowd like this out of desperation,
either.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may think of rats in
cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
they actually like it there!</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take 10,000 per square mile as a
reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If their land is downzoned for
farming, open space, or habitat,
they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a case showing how this
works. The Los Angeles
Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
and condemned the land. The case
went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i>
to SP to help subsidize
mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
create in the future.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Later, MTA was to stint on subway
construction, resulting in
subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
<b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us. ...</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>Urban
Sprawl</b></small></small>
</small></small><br>
<small>We have met the enemy, and it is US (Urban Sprawl). Let's
analyze
this beast, US.
</small><br>
<small><b>A. Development is
not identical with Sprawl</b>
</small><br>
<small>Many people carelessly equate urban growth and urban sprawl, but
they are not the same, not at all. Cities may grow like the posh
upper East Side of Manhattan with 100,000 per square mile, or San
Francisco with 15,000, or Riverside, California with 2500, or
Oklahoma City with 734. Metropolitan regions are even more varied. We
have seen that 250 million Americans could fit nicely into a small
part of southern California, were it compactly settled at moderate
urban densities that are actually found in practice, as in the upper
middle class suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin (10,000 per square
mile).
</small><br>
<br>
<small>Urban sprawl, which creates a psychological effect of great
crowding, is not the product of development as such, but of
leapfrogging. Leapfrogging means chaos, with development in the wrong
places and times. Infilling, on the other hand, is anti-sprawl. It is
the cure for sprawl.... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><span

Wyn Achenbaum: <a href="../docs/Achenbaum_EmDo.html">Eminent Domain and Government Giveaways </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    It seems to me that there are better ways than eminent domain to
      provide the incentives that will lead the private sector to develop
      choice land. I've walked the New London, Connecticut, neighborhood
      involved in the Kelo case (before I was aware of the case). It sits
      fairly high above the Thames River near Long Island Sound, overlooking
      Fort Trumbull, which has been restored in recent years. On the other
      side is the new Pfizer research facility and a manmade lagoon and
      wetlands, apparently quite carefully planned and planted, some of it on
      land reclaimed after being the site for a junkyard.<br>
    <br>
    While at one time this area might have been an appropriate place for a neighborhood
      of single family homes, it appeared to me that that time had passed a decade
      or so ago. It seemed to me that the path of progress would -- if the incentives
      were logical and the market responsive to signals -- have caused the private
      sector to have redeveloped that site. Such re-development might have been painful
      to the residents of the neighborhood, but would have put now-choice land to a
  higher and better use than single-family homes. <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p>Our land, particularly the best-located land, is a common asset on which we
      are all dependent. Allowing individuals or corporations to occupy it without
      compensating the rest of us for its value is the underlying problem, and solving
      that problem through good assessment and rational (that is, land value) taxes
      is the way to solve it. When we do that, a lot of problems will begin to fall
  away. <a href="../docs/Achenbaum_EmDo.html">read the whole article</a></p>
