<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We hold: That&#8212;</p>
  <p>This world is the creation of God.</p>
  <p>The men brought into it for the brief period of their earthly lives are
    the equal creatures of his bounty, the equal subjects of his provident care.</p>
  <p>By his constitution man is beset by physical wants, on the satisfaction
    of which depend not only the maintenance of his physical life but also the
    development of his intellectual and spiritual life.</p>
  <p>God has made the satisfaction of these wants dependent on man&#8217;s own
    exertions, giving him the power and laying on him the injunction to labor &#8212; a
    power that of itself raises him far above the brute, since we may reverently
    say that it enables him to become as it were a helper in the creative work.</p>
  <p>God has not put on man the task of making bricks without straw. With the
    need for labor and the power to labor he has also given to man the material
    for labor. This material is land &#8212; man physically being a land animal,
    who can live only on and from land, and can use other elements, such as air,
    sunshine and water, only by the use of land.</p>
  <p>Being the equal creatures of the Creator, equally entitled under his providence
    to live their lives and satisfy their needs, men are equally entitled to
    the use of land, and any adjustment that denies this equal use of land is
    morally wrong. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better
      term have come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ.
      We regard them
    as erring in opposite directions &#8212; <em>the one in ignoring the social
    nature of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature.</em></strong><em> </em>While
    we see that man is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has
    come or can
    come
      from the interference by the state with things that belong to individual
      action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called
    him, a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social advance,
    having
      an indispensable place in the natural order. Looking on the bodily organism
      as the analogue of the social organism, and on the proper functions of
    the state as akin to those that in the human organism are discharged by the
    conscious
      intelligence, while the play of individual impulse and interest performs
      functions akin to those discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious
      instincts and involuntary motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who
      would try to get along without heads and the socialists like men who would
      try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of
    their frames by conscious will. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole

<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
   Land Question</a> (1881)<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">  </a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean;
imagine a little world swimming
in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
primitive, this will work well enough.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turn away the eyes of the mind for
a moment, let time pass, and
look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
even supposing there have been no important inventions or
improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
During this time some of these people will have been careless,
generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
produced poverty and virtual slavery.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
the people we have supposed are
human beings &#8211; that is to
say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
live only on land and by the aid of the products of land.</span> They
may
make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
everything as he wills.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, however, the concentration of
landownership has not gone so
far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
competition between them as well as between those who have only their
labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
labor cannot exist without land. <strong>If I own a piece of land, I can let
it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
over the laborer.</strong> It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But let us introduce another
element into the supposition. Let us
suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Manifestly, the effect of all such
discoveries and inventions is
to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
dependent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, since we are imagining
conditions, imagine laborsaving
inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
the landowners! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

hardly conceive.

  <li><small>It will

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It will thus, so we reverently
believe, clear the way
for the coming of that kingdom of right and justice, and consequently
of abundance and peace and happiness, for which the Master told His
disciples to pray and work. It is not that it is a promising
invention or cunning device that we look for the Single Tax to do all
this; but it is because it involves a conforming of the most
important and fundamental adjustments of society to the supreme law
of justice, because it involves the basing of the most important of
our laws on the principle that we should do to others as we would be
done by.</small></div>

fairly presume, believe, as I
believe, that there is a world for us beyond this. The limit of space
has prevented me from putting before them more than some hints for
thought. Let me in conclusion present two more:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. What would be the
result in heaven itself if those who get there first instituted private
property in the surface of heaven, and parceled it out in absolute
ownership among themselves, as we parcel out the surface of the earth? </small>
  <p><small>2. Since we cannot conceive of a heaven in which the equal
rights of God's children to their Father's bounty is denied, as we now
deny them on this earth, what is the duty enjoined on Christians by the
daily prayer: "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is
in heaven?"</small><small>...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p><small></small>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_FOTSS.html">Fallacies of the
Slippery Slope Argument</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a difference, too,
between explaining things historically
and attributing unilinear causality to social events. As it
happens, if our views of human nature and of social institutions are
colored by pessimism and if we believe that we human beings are by
nature self serving and rapacious, we are likely to have one view of
matters. If, on the other hand, our view of human beings, both
collectively and individually, is more optimistic and altruistic, our
conclusions will reflect this too.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This has been borne out in several studies of personality and
politics
over the years. People with a dim view of human nature are more likely
to see conspiracies and negative consequences to what is often
perceived as social
engineering. And people more trusting of others and of
institutional authority are less likely to be concerned about the
negative consequences of policy proposals.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> In </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">recent
years, those wearing the popular
appellation of &#8220;conservative&#8221; &#8212; at least in the American sense of the
term &#8212; are more distrustful of others, of government, and of
institutions generally. There is a further corollary to this as well:
that people who believe that human nature is inherently selfish will
tend to believe that their own selfish behavior is only natural, and
they will attribute the same low motives to others that they use to
justify their own behavior.
</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This further reinforces their own view that they are completely
justified in acting in the way that they do. Realizing that this is
the mentality that drives such people, those who take a more benign
view of human nature and of political institutions are then compelled
to find the motives of their opposites suspect and threatening.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small> So
such escalating distrust becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>I would like to illustrate the dynamics ofthis thinking through
one
widely used psychological scale, used in countless studies over the
course of
some 40 years. It is known as the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faith
in People
Scale</span>,&#8221; originally developed in 1956 by Rosenberg.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> One
point is awarded for each scaled response. A score of five identifies
you as having a very low level of trust in others. I will read the five
paired statements to you, since they are very short: </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. Some people say that most
people
can be trusted. Others say you can&#8217;t be too careful in your
dealings with people. How do you feel about it?</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>&#8226; Most people can be trusted.</small> <small>&#8226; You
    can&#8217;t be too careful.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2. Would you say that most
people are
more inclined to help others, or more inclined to look out for
themselves?</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>&#8226; To help others.</small> <small>&#8226; To
    look out for themselves.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>3. If you don&#8217;t watch yourself,
people will take advantage of you.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disagree</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>4. No one is going to care much
what
happens to you, when you get right down to it.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disagree</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>5. Human nature is fundamentally
cooperative.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>Agree &nbsp; &nbsp; Disagree</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><br>
So that&#8217;s what it may come down to, not to a matter of validity of
the slippery slope argument as measured in logical terms, but
rather by the extent to which social decisions are made by people who
can be trusted and relied
upon to act in altruistic ways. If people expect the worst, the
worst may happen. If people look on the positive side, that trust may
engender further such feelings and be self-reinforcing.&#8220;What goes
around comes around,&#8221; as they say, applied to both conservatives with a
dim view of human nature and society as well as to progressives with
their more hopeful view. </small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a further dimension to all this which offers a
fascinating
area for study. The faith-in-people scale along with many other
research instruments has been used in many societies and at various
times. But time has been too short in this
country for us to be able to say very much about what has happened over
the past 250 years with respect to public sentiments. The general view
is that people have become more cynical and pessimistic; what this
portends for America&#8217;s future, and particularly the future of our
political health, is well worth pondering. </small><br>
<br>
<small>We used to be a nation of optimists, at least as other nations
saw us.
That may have been our greatest asset. If we lose this optimism, we
may be the worse for it as a nation. And to this extent, our declining

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the law of human
progress?&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George saw ours alone among the
civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
