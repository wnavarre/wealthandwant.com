    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Frequent, regular and logical accurate
        assessment of real estate is vitally important to making taxes just.&nbsp; Assessment
          provides the criteria for rebalancing the tax load among all the property-owners
          within a particular jurisdiction.&nbsp; Not all sites appreciate at
          the same rate.&nbsp; Lots  near positive amenities &#8212; attractive
          bodies of water, public transportation, highways, good schools, high-paying
          jobs,
          large populations
          &#8212; appreciate faster than properties  which are poorly located
          &#8212; near negative amenities such as sewage treatment plants, the
          town dump,
          tollbooths
          where traffic idles; served by inferior schools, far from jobs or public
         transportation.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Frequent
          reassessment allows those who benefit the most from our common spending
          or the generosity of nature to heft their fair share of the costs of
          providing
          all those services that make their sites valuable, and frees those
        who own inferior sites from paying a disproportionately high share of
        the
         burden. &nbsp;This is generally considered to be consistent with justice. </p>
      <p>Doing this well, including providing a meaningful figure for
         land value and for the value of the current improvement (be it a parking
     lot, an obsolete building, or a new building) provides the landholder important
         clues about his property's worth and potential.&nbsp; The next step,
         of course, is what the local government does with that information.&nbsp; Currently,
         most places tax both land value and buildings at the same millage rate.&nbsp; This
         website argues that this is a sad mistake: that a better way would be
         to reduce or eliminate the millage rate on the buildings and increase
         the millage rate
         on the land.&nbsp; This reduces the perverse incentives which discourage
         those who improve their properties, and encourage those who merely
         speculate on land values.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">Note 4: The difference between site value and improvement
              value is much more definite than it is often supposed to be. Even in
              what would
            seem
            at
            first to be most confusing cases, it is easily distinguished. If in any
            example we imagine the complete destruction of all the improvements,
            we may discover in the remaining value of the property &#8212; in the
            price it would after such destruction fetch in the real estate market &#8212; the
            value of the site as distinguished from the value of the improvements.
            This residuum of value would be the basis of computation for levying
            the single tax.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">The distinction is frequently made in business life. Whenever in the
            course of ordinary business affairs it becomes necessary to estimate
            the value of a building lot, or to fix royalties for mining privileges,
            no difficulty is experienced, and substantial justice is done. And though
            the exigencies of business seldom require the site value of an improved
            farm to be distinguished from the value of its improvements, yet it could
            doubtless be done as easily and justly as with city or mining property.
            Unimproved land attached to any farm in question, or unimproved land
            in the neighborhood, if similar in fertility and location, would furnish
            a sufficiently accurate measure. If neither existed, the value of the
            contiguous highway would always be available.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">It should not be forgotten that land for which the demand is so weak
            that its site value cannot be easily distinguished from the value of
            its improvements, is certain to be land of but little value, and almost
            certain to have no value at all.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">The objection that the value of land cannot be distinguished from the
            value of its improvements is among the most frivolous of the objections
            that have been raised to the single tax by people with whom the wish
            that it may be impracticable is father to the thought that it really
            is so. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>No other tax, direct or indirect, conforms so closely to the third maxim. &quot;Land
        lies out of doors.&quot; It cannot be hidden; it cannot be &quot;accidentally&quot; overlooked.
        Nor can its value be seriously misstated. Neither under-appraisement
        nor over-appraisement to any important degree is possible without the
        connivance of the whole community. 27 The land values of a neighborhood
        are matters of common knowledge. Any intelligent resident can justly
        appraise them, and every other intelligent resident can fairly test the
        appraisement. Therefore, the tyranny, corruption, fraud, favoritism,
        and evasions that are so common in connection with the taxation of imports,
        manufactures, incomes, personal property, and buildings &#8212; the values
        of which, even when the object itself cannot be hidden, are so distinctly
        matters of minute special knowledge that only experts can fairly appraise
        them &#8212; would be out of the question if the single tax were substituted
        for existing fiscal methods. 28</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">27. The under-appraisements so common at present,
            and alluded to in note 25, are possible because the community, ignorant
            of the just principles of taxation, does connive at them. Under-appraisements
            are not secret crimes on the part of assessors; they are distinctly
            recognized, but thoughtlessly disregarded when not actually insisted
            upon, by the people themselves. And this is due to the dishonest
            ideas of taxation that are taught. Let the vicious doctrine that
            people ought to pay taxes according to their ability give way to
            the honest principle that they should pay in proportion to the benefits
            they receive, which benefits, as we have already seen, are measured
            by the land values they own, and underappraisement of land would
            cease. No assessor can befool the community in respect of the value
            of the land within his jurisdiction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">And, with the cessation of general under-appraisement,
            favoritism in individual appraisements also would cease. General
            under-appraisement fosters unfair individual appraisements. If land
            were generally appraised at its full value, a particular unfair appraisement
            would stand out in such relief that the crime of the assessor would
            be exposed. But now if a man's land is appraised at a higher valuation
            than his neighbor's equally valuable land, and he complains of the
            unfairness, he is promptly and effectually silenced with a warning
            that his land is worth much more than it is appraised at, anyhow,
            and if he makes a fuss his appraisement will be increased. To complain
            further of the deficient taxation of his neighbor is to invite the
            imposition of a higher tax upon himself.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">28. If you wish to test the merits in point of certainty
            of the single tax as compared with other taxes, go to a real estate
            agent in your community, and, showing him a building lot upon the
            map, ask him its value. If he inquires about the improvements, instruct
            him to ignore them. He will be able at once to tell you what the
            lot is worth. And if you go to twenty other agents their estimates
            will not materially vary from his. Yet none of the agents will have
            left his office. Each will have inferred the value from the size
            and location of the lot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">But suppose when you show the map to the first agent
            you ask him the value of the land and its improvements. He will tell
            you that he cannot give an estimate until he examines the improvements.
            And if it is the highly improved property of a rich man he will engage
            building experts to assist him. Should you ask him to include the
            value of the contents of the buildings, he would need a corps of
            selected experts, including artists and liverymen, dealers in furniture
            and bric-a-brac, librarians and jewelers. Should you propose that
            he also include the value of the occupant's income, the agent would
            throw up his hands in despair.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">If without the aid of an army of experts the agent
            should make an estimate of these miscellaneous values, and twenty
            others should do the same, their several estimates would be as wide
            apart as ignorant guesses usually are. And the richer the owner of
            the property the lower as a proportion would the guesses probably
            be.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Now turn the real estate agent into an assessor, and
            is it not plain that he would appraise the land values with much
            greater certainty and cheapness than he could appraise the values
            of all kinds of property? With a plot map before him he might fairly
            make every appraisement without leaving his desk at the town hall.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">And there would be no material difference if the property
            in question were a farm instead of a building lot. A competent farmer
            or business man in a farming community can, without leaving his own
            door-yard, appraise the value of the land of any farm there; whereas
            it would be impossible for him to value the improvements, stock,
            produce, etc., without at least inspecting them. </font>... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Q8. What would be the expense of collecting the single tax as compared
          with that of collecting present taxes?</em><br>
    A. Much less. It is easier to assess fairly, and easier to collect fully;
    the machinery of assessment and collection would be simpler and cheaper,
    and it would not enable first payers to collect the tax with profits upon
    it from ultimate payers.</p>
      <p><em>Q9. How would you estimate land values?</em><br>
        A. As we do it now. As real estate dealers estimate them. As appraisers
          in partition would estimate them. Read note 28.</p>
      <p><em>Q10. How would you value the land of a farm when all the land of the
        neighborhood was fully improved?</em><br>
        A. By ascertaining the value per square rod of the adjacent highway.
        The value of that, for the purpose of adding it to the farms along which
        it runs, would denote the land value of the farms. Read notes 4 and 28.</p>
      <p>        <em>Q12. How would the single tax be assessed on a railroad which passed
          through a farm worth (without its improvements) $30 an acre?</em><br>
        A. According to the value, not of the adjacent farms, but of the total
        right of way, much as the value of a navigable river might be determined
        if it were private property. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

A. Its site value -- its selling or market value -- its net value to the purchaser

  the assessors as the basis of taxation.</p>
      <p><em>Q53. How would the single tax effect the farmer?</em><br>
A. It would greatly reduce his taxes. His buildings, stock, and crops would be
  exempt. His land is at present assessed at nearly twice its proper unimproved
  value, while town and city land is often valued at less than one half its actual
  value, thus subjecting him to a more than fourfold disadvantage. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read

      <p>Land, in an economic sense, is defined as the entire material universe
          outside of people themselves and the products of people. It includes all
          natural resources, materials, airwaves, as well as the ground. All air,
          soil, minerals and water is included in the definition of land. Everything
          that is freely supplied by nature, and not made by man, is categorized
        as land.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Land holds a unique and pivotal position in social, political, environmental
          and economic theory. Land supports all life and stands at the center of
          human culture and institutions. All people, at all times, must make use
          of land. Land has no cost of production. It is nature's gift to mankind,
          which enables life to continue and prosper.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Land's uniqueness stems from its fixed supply and immobility. Land cannot
          be manufactured or reproduced. Land is required directly or indirectly
          in the production of all goods and services. Land is our most basic resource
          and the source of all wealth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Land rent is the price paid annually for the exclusive right (a monopoly)
          to use a certain location, piece of land or other natural resource. People
          receive wages for work, capital receives interest for investment, and land
          receives rent for the exclusive use of a location. Equity and efficiency
          require that the local general public, who created land value, should be
          paid for the exclusive use of a land site. That Payment is in the form
          of a land tax.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>When considering world-wide economics, most people think that land rent
          contributes only a small insignificant portion of value. But as societies
          progress, land has become the predominant force in determining the progress
          or poverty of all people within a community. Land in major or cities is
          so costly that people are forced to move further away and travel great
          distances in order to get to work and social attractions. In the more developed
          countries of the world, land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual
          production.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Since land is fixed in supply, as more land is demanded by people the
          rent will increase proportionally. Demand is the sole determinant of land
          rent. Changes in land rent and land taxes have no impact on the supply
          of land, because the land supply is fixed and cannot be significantly expanded.
          Labor and capital are variable in supply. A higher price for commodities
          causes more labor and capital to make itself available. Labor and capital
          are rewarded for their work. A high price is an incentive to work harder
          and longer, while a low price is not an incentive to work harder and longer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The rent of land, however, serves no such incentive function, because
          the supply of land is fixed. The same amount is available no matter how
          high or low the price. Buildings are not a part of land rent. Land rent
          results from the desire made by everyone who lives within a community to
          use land. Economic rent is the only source of revenue that could be taken
          for community purposes without having any negative effect on the productive
          potential of the economy. Economists consider rent to be a surplus payment
          which is unnecessary to ensure that land is available. When a community
          captures land rent for public purposes, both efficiency and equity are
          realized.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The economic market rental value of land should be sufficient to finance
          public services and to obviate the need for raising revenue from taxes,
          such as income or wage taxes; sales, commodity or value-added taxes;
        and taxes on buildings, machinery and industry. Public revenue should
        not be
          supplied by taxes on people and enterprise until after all of the available
          revenue has been first collected from the natural and community created
          value of land. Only if land rent were insufficient would it be necessary
          to collect any taxes.</p>

      <p>Land value taxation taps the geo-rent. Like
        today&#8217;s real property
              tax, a land value tax would have some tax rate that would tap some
        percentage of the land value or rent. I suggest 80 percent of the geo-rent
        be used
              for public revenue. The landowner would pay it from the rental
        he collects from the tenant, or if owner-occupied, from the implicit
        rental
        value he
              obtains from the site. The 80 percent rate would leave some of

              to maintain a positive price for the land to facilitate its sale.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>There are several methods of assessing land value or rent. One way is
              to calculate the replacement value of the existing improvements (unless
              they are historic), and then subtract the depreciation of the buildings.
              Then subtract the building value from the total property value. What is
              left is land value. For commercial property, one also can take the net
              income and subtract the return on the improvements (using some interest
              rate), the remainder being land rent. In some places there is vacant or
              bare land that has a market price, and sometimes there are separate owners
              for the land and the improvements, for which data can be derived from leases
              and sales. The assessors then smooth out the neighborhood land values,
              using computerized maps. It is not necessary to individually assess the
              values of most of the buildings in a neighborhood, since most lots in a
              locality will have a similar value per lot.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Assessors enter this data into computers, which generate neighborhood
              maps. The assessors interpolate or smooth out the prices of lots
        between those for which they have recent sales or rental data, since
        land values
              tend to be similar in a neighborhood unless there is some special
        feature such as corner lots or odd-sized lots. ... </p>
      <p>...There will always be critics who concoct a huge cost in getting assessments
        correct down to the last penny, or claim, without any evidence, that
        real estate is a trivial portion of the economy. Such critics date back
        to the days of Henry George, when the landed interests felt threatened
        by his ideas. Those opponents have been thoroughly rebutted in the book,
        Critics of Henry George (the latest edition edited in 2004 by Robert
        Andelson). The reasons for such attempts to falsify and trivialize rent-based
        public finance, and even to eliminate the land factor from economics,
        are chronicled and analyzed in The Corruption of Economics, especially
        in the chapter by Mason Gaffney, &#8220;Neo-classical Economics as a
        Stratagem against Henry George.&#8221; This negative viewpoint is perpetuated
        by academics who learn of land value taxation from misleading secondary
        sources, not bothering to dig any further.</p>
      <p> Those who argue it is impossible to assess the value of land apart
        from improvements need to answer why this is in practice accomplished
        well in Arden, Delaware, a community established by Georgists in 1900
        explicitly to demonstrate its practicality. They also need to explain
        how cities such as Sidney, Australia have a real property tax only on
        the land value, and how Japan, Taiwan, Denmark, and many other countries
        had successful land taxes (see Andelson, Robert V., ed., Land-Value Taxation
        Around the World). Also, thousands of condominiums assess their owners
        independently of their personal property. If this is said to be impossible
        in theory, yet it is done in common practice, one wonders about a scholar
        who ignores the widespread practice in favor of the alleged doctrine.
        ...</p>
      <p><strong><em>Costs of collection and administration</em></strong></p>
      <p>Consider the effect of abolishing income taxes and sales taxes, replacing
        them with a land value tax. There would no longer be any tax audits.
        There would be no record-keeping for taxes. You, the landowner, would
        instead get a monthly bill, like you get for utilities. You would simply
        pay the bill or have it automatically deducted from some financial account.
        At the same time, government would avoid the high cost of processing
        complex accounts and keeping individual tax records. It would only need
        to keep real estate records and assess the land values, both of which
        it already does for property tax purposes.</p>
      <p>Those who are retired or temporarily have little cash income would be
        able to defer taxes by accumulating liens on the real estate until they
        die or sell the property, as is commonly done today with real estate
        taxes.</p>
      <p>If you thought the assessment of the land value was too high, you could
        appeal, as one can today&#8217;s real estate taxes. The land value assessments
        would be public records available on the Internet, unlike income tax
        records, which are quite properly hidden from public view. You could
        easily compare your assessment with those of your neighbors. If the appeals
        board rejected your claim, the assessment could be appealed to a jury,
        if you were willing to pay the cost of the jury&#8217;s decision.</p>
      <p>Nobody would be sent to prison for tax evasion, because there would
        be no tax evasion. A non-payer would lose title to his land or lose the
        protective services of government, depending on the local enforcement
        practice. Property taxes are already being assessed and collected by
        counties in the U.S. A complete shift to the taxation of land values
        would not increase these costs, but would eliminate the expenses involved
        in collecting sales and income taxes.  ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

              follow the process a little further. The population of the
              city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
              poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
              thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
              120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
              present time.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> At last the land becomes
              ripe for sale -- that means that
              the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
              not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
              twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
              alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. </span>The
              greater
              the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
              sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
              been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
              strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
              when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact, you may say that the
              unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
              by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
              meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
              increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
              not to the service but to the disservice done. <span

          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax on capital value of
              undeveloped land</span>&nbsp; But there is another proposal concerning
              land values which is not less
              important. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or
              suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
              under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
              consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
              measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
              already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
              town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
              rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
              the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
              daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
              Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
              admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of the land monopolist
              as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
              example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not take that view of
              the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dog-in-the-manger</span>
          game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
              the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
              or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
              we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
              -- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
              yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
              property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
              It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
              which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
              still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
              the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
              proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
              such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
              than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
              fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with
        regard to the land, and its effects will be, </small>      </div>

            Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
            Chapter 9. Alleged Difficulty of Distinguishing Land From Improvements</a> (in
            the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
            VIII &#8212; Application of the Remedy: Chapter 4 &#8212;<font size="-1"> </font>Indorsements
          and objections </a></p>
      <blockquote>
            <p>The only objection to the tax on rent or land values which is to be
              met with in standard politico-economic works is one which concedes its
              advantages &#8212; for it is, that from the difficulty of separation,
              we might, in taxing the rent of land, tax something else. McCulloch,
              for instance, declares taxes on the rent of land to be impolitic and
              unjust because the return received for the natural and inherent powers
              of the soil cannot be clearly distinguished from the return received
              from improvements and meliorations, which might thus be discouraged.
              Macaulay somewhere says that if the admission of the attraction of gravitation
              were inimical to any considerable pecuniary interest, there would not
              be wanting arguments against gravitation &#8212; a truth of which this
              objection is an illustration. For admitting that it is impossible invariably
              to separate the value of land from the value of improvements, is this
              necessity of continuing to tax some improvements any reason why we should
              continue to tax all improvements? If it discourage production to tax
              values which labor and capital have intimately combined with that of
              land, how much greater discouragement is involved in taxing not only
              these, but all the clearly distinguishable values which labor and capital
            create?</p>
            <p>But, as a matter of fact, the value of land can always be readily distinguished
            from the value of improvements.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> In countries like the United States there is much valuable land
                that has never been improved; and in many of the States the value of
                the land and the value of improvements are habitually estimated separately
              by the assessors, though afterward reunited under the term real estate.</li>
              <li> Nor where ground has been occupied from immemorial times, is there
                any difficulty in getting at the value of the bare land, for frequently
                the land is owned by one person and the buildings by another, and when
                a fire occurs and improvements are destroyed, a clear and definite
              value remains in the land.</li>
              <li> In the oldest country in the world no difficulty whatever can attend
                the separation, if all that be attempted is to separate the value of
                the clearly distinguishable improvements, made within a moderate period,
              from the value of the land, should they be destroyed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This, manifestly, is all that justice or policy requires. Absolute accuracy
              is impossible in any system, and to attempt to separate all that the
              human race has done from what nature originally provided would be as
              absurd as impracticable. A swamp drained or a hill terraced by the Romans
              constitutes now as much a part of the natural advantages of the British
              Isles as though the work had been done by earthquake or glacier. The
              fact that after a certain lapse of time the value of such permanent improvements
              would be considered as having lapsed into that of the land, and would
              be taxed accordingly, could have no deterrent effect on such improvements,
              for such works are frequently undertaken upon leases for years. The fact
              is, that each generation builds and improves for itself, and not for
              the remote future. And the further fact is, that each generation is heir,
              not only to the natural powers of the earth, but to all that remains
              of the work of past generations. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/09_Distinguishing.htm">read

          <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
              a case
              for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
              logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
              follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
              principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
              the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
              one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
              is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
              important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
          efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
              because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
          for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
              on land
              would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
              report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
              shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
          in the Appendix.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
          taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
              reasons
              why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
          world peace.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
              argument for
              taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
              offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
              rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
              price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
              land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
              increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
              become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
              land.&nbsp; The answer to this argument is that collecting a large
              percentage of the rental value of land through taxes will require new
              assessment methods based on observing the rental price of land rather
              than the selling price.&nbsp; I describe how such methods can be
          devised.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
              on
              land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
          the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
              erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
              because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
          collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
          <small>.</small><br>
          <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
              that the
              return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
          rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
              what land
          is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>While it is theoretically possible to capture fractions of rent
              approaching 100% by taxes on the value of land, there are practical
              difficulties in doing so.&nbsp; The selling price of unimproved land
              will be the present value of the part of rent that buyers and sellers
              expect to be left after taxes.&nbsp; Therefore, if taxes collect
              fractions of rent that approach 100%, the selling price of land will be
              dominated by the errors that are expected in the assessment
              process.&nbsp; Therefore a tax system that seeks to collect almost all
              of the rental value of land must use some assessment system other than
              observing market prices of land.&nbsp; There are several techniques
          that may be useful.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>First, if nearly all of the rental value of land is collected in
              taxes,
              the selling price of land will be nearly zero.&nbsp; Assessors can
              purchase parcels of land with obsolescent improvements, demolish the
              improvements, and offer the land for sale at auction, under a rule that
              the bid will be the tax per year for, say, the first three years, and
              after that the tax will be determined by the assessor&#8217;s estimate of the
              rental value of the land, as determined by similar auctions and other
          processes.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>If assessors were conducting such auctions regularly, they could
              hold
              assessment contests in which the contestants competed by offering land
              value functions that would be evaluated by the accuracy with which they
              predicted auction results.&nbsp; The contestant who provided the
              function with the smallest average error would be given a prize, and
              the winning function would be used to assess the value of land that had
          not been auctioned.&nbsp; </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Another thing that assessors can do is to develop options
              markets in
              land.&nbsp; That is, they can enter into contracts with potential users
              of land to supply land with specified characteristics for specified tax
              rates.&nbsp; For example, someone who was interested in opening a
              restaurant might offer &pound;3,000 per month for a parcel of 2,000
              square feet within a quarter of a mile of the center of town.&nbsp;
          Such offers would set lower limits on the rental value of land.&nbsp;
          With such devices, land can be assessed for tax purposes even if the
              selling price of land is close to zero. ... <a

            Tax Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
                In a
                market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
            four factors of production: </small></p>
            <ul>
              <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
              <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
              <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
              <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
              investments and organizing production). </small></li>
            </ul>
            <p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
                must
                either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
                entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
            that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
            <p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
                so at
                the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
                to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
                that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
                reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
                springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
                Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
                attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
                city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
                entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
                that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
                interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
            market forces.</small></p>
            <p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
                earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
                away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
                interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
            have the option of moving away. </small></p>
            <p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
                rent
                of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
                sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
                opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
            for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
            <p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
                revenue
                to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
                entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
            collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
            <p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
                urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
                rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
            and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong>      </small></p>
            <small><strong>...</strong> Every activity that is
                continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
                Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
                rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
                pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
            </small>
            <p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
            financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
            <p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
                public
                revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
                equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
                on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
                
      </small></p>
            <ul>
              <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
                of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
                of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
                of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
                be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
                than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
                it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
              spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
              <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
                rental value of land comes from the provision
                of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
                services
                can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
              results from their activities.</small></li>
              <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
                rental value of any particular site arises
                from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
                site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
                land is
                particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
                private activities according to how much they increase the rental
              value of land.</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
                land
            has two parts. </small></p>
            <ul>
              <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
                of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
                does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
                according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
                and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
                on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
                invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
                investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
                when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
                amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
                Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
                productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
              revenue do.</small></li>
              <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
                efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
                to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
                not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
                ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
                use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
                are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
                rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
                ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
              someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>To achieve the potential
                efficiency of public revenue from land,
                it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
                just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
                The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
                that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
                should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
                can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
            their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
            <p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
                privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
                according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
                it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
            passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
            <p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
                generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
                And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
            land.</small></p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
                efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
                finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
            revenue as well:</small></p>
            <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
                as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
                radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
              <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
                payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
              revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
                pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
                estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
                on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
              cost.</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
              value of surrounding land.</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
                crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
                others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
                is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
                handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
              that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
              which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
                electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
                make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
                is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
                he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
                increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
              covered by user charges.</small></p>
              <small> </small>
              <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
                at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
                tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
                to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
                pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
                may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
                it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
                identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
              purposes.</small></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
                of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
                collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
                excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
                basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
                finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
                additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
                all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
                paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
                tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
                disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
            most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
            <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
                the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
                moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
                of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
                corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
                higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
                higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
                complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
                to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
                partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
                provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
                receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
                for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
                investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
                a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
                change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
                all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
                corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
                either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
                be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
                Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
                attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
                government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
            collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
            <p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
                features. 
            </small></p>
            <ul>
              <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
                that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
                competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
                of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
                this feature. 
              </small></li>
              <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
                is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
                person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
                pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of

          Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a

            Gains Debate</a><br>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
            On the other hand, the Fed statistics<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
            understate land values for methodological reasons. Starting with
                estimates for overall real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
                subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
                capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
                replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
                construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
                steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
                is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><small></small>However, the value of any building tends
                eventually to decline,
                until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
                which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
                with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
            Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
                because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
                uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
                costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
                on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
                particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
                land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
                This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
                tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
                improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
                not its current net income but its opportunity cost -- the minimum
                yield
                required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
                instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
                rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
            land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small></small><br>
          <small><small></small></small></div>
          <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>39 Indeed, where
              ill-maintained old buildings occupy prime
              locations, a parcel may be more valuable once the building is
              demolished and the lot cleared for reuse See Gaffney (1993 and also
              1971). Some improvements, such as gas stations and refineries, are
              accompanied by ecological pollution, which can be analyzed as a
              negative improvement -- the property would be worth more without it.
              Pollution may greatly increase the saIvage cost of land making it
              uneconomical to salvage some lands despite the value they would have if
              clean. This &#8220;brownfields&#8221; problem has received considerable public
              notice in recent months.
        </small></small></div>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
            <small>Thus, the correct way to separate land values from building
                values is
                to appraise land values directly in terms of opportunity cost -- how
                much
                would a vacant lot at that site fetch in the market? If the observed
                market value of the improved property exceeds the land value, the
                residual is the implied value of the standing improvements. The Fed&#8217;s
                land-residual method theoretically understates the land share of real
                estate values.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40</span></small> The
                pitfall of this methodology is demonstrated to an almost comical degree
                by the fact that according to Fed statistics, the land component of
                corporately owned real estate has been reduced to near zero over the
                past five years (while the nominal reproduction costs of factories and
            other corporately held buildings are inflating).</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The measurement problem is exacerbated by assessment bias in
                many
                states and localities. Particularly where land values are trending
                upward, overestimates of building values relative to site values
                reflect the steady under-assessment of land. Note that as a larger
                share of real estate value is imputed to buildings, a larger share of
                cash flow can be claimed as depreciation. In effect, assessment bias
                allows investors to partly depreciate land, at no cost to local
          government budgets.</small> <a

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
      <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
      buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
      value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
      replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
      little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
      unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
      repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
      Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
      The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
      intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
      <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
      the land, and treats the difference as representing the building's
      value. The first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map
      for the district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land
      values. Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations
      in property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
      along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
      rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
      parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
      parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
      in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
      be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
      maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
        appraisal methods do not
        acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
        price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
        driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
        as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
        around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
        rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
        built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
        acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
        up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
        ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
    changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve multiplies the
        building's original cost by the
        rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
        implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
        usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
        value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
    lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
        explanation of land/building relations
        should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
        same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
        property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
      <b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
        that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
        price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
    accordingly.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
        accepted, then I believe that economists
        would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
        opposite usually is done. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    <small><strong>How Valuations would be Made</strong></small><strong> </strong> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
        and for reasons of economic
        efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
    programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
        terms of social justice is
        founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
        absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
        and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
        economic development and government expenditures should be collected
        by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
      is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
    resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
        institutions capable of implementing a
        recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
        basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
        implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
        heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
        nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
        all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
        are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
        rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
    unimproved condition.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
        terms of economic efficiency is
        founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
        human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
        does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
        revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
        government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
        frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
        as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
        sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
        greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
    productivity.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
        the amount of tax that is due
        cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
        taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
        They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
        are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
        fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
        worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
        resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
        levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
        And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
    the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
        more detail these social justice
        and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
        for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
        potential objections are without merit.<strong> ... 
        </strong>    </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How Valuations would
    be Made</b></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before describing the valuation
        process, which employs auctions,
        it is useful to discuss the concept of a "second-price auction." <b>A
        second price auction is one in which each bidder submits a single
        sealed bid, and the object is sold to the highest bidder at a price
        equal to the second highest bid.</b> Second-price auctions have the
        advantage of making bidding simpler and more straight-forward. In an
        ordinary sealed-bid auction, in which the highest bidder pays what he
        or she bids, bidders are induced to under-bid strategically, not
        revealing the full value to them of the auctioned item, so that they
        can obtain it at a more advantageous price. This incentive for
        strategic underbidding is eliminated by a second-price auction. With
        a second price auction, a bidder who bids less than the object is
        worth saves no money as long as he or she is the highest bidder, and
        if the bid is low enough not to be the highest bid, the object is
        lost to another bidder. Nor is over-bidding beneficial. Either it
        makes no difference, or it results in the object being bought at a
        price of more that it is worth to the bidder. Thus honest statements
        of the value of the thing being auctioned are in the self-interest of
        bidders in second-price auctions. By a similar line of reasoning,
        when a contract is to be let to the lowest bidder, honest statements
        of the lowest price at which a party is willing to do the work can be
        obtained by letting the contract to the lowest bidder at a price
        equal to the second-lowest bid. There are two efficiency advantages
        to second-price auctions. Bidders do not have to spend resources
        trying to compute their strategically most advantageous bids, and
        because bids represent accurate valuations, the winning bidder is the
        person who values the object most, or can truly do the work at the
        lowest cost. It might seem that the amount received by the seller
        would be smaller in a second-price auction. However, the higher bids
        that result from removing the incentive for strategic under-bidding
        approximately offset the reduced returns from charging only the
        second-highest bid.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the proposed system of site
        value rating, valuations would be
        made by property market professionals, who would be rewarded
        according to the accuracy of their valuations, as revealed by
        occasional auctions. An administrative agency would divide territory
        into blocks of a convenient size and take bids for valuation of all
        sites in a block, with the valuation contract going to the lowest
        bidder, at a price equal to the second-lowest bid. The valuer would
        provide a formula that could be used to compute the value of any site
        in the block, taking into account such features as size, proximity to
        shops and transportation, width of the street on which the property
        was located, and any other objectively measurable attributes that
        were thought to be related to site values. The actual payment to the
        valuer would be reduced in proportion to the average inaccuracy of
        the valuations, as revealed by subsequent auctions of some of the
        sites.... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

        truly national public goods, other ideas must be explored.</span> One
        of the major national public goods is defense. In a perfectly just
        world, everyone would be so respectful of the rights of others, and
        everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending would be
        desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want
        public defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?
        </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
        can be provided by a
        Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital, which makes
        a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S. requires
        a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it is
        because the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a
        more attractive target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital
        might reasonably be charged for the increase in the defense budget
        that is needed to make other citizens as safe as they would be if
        that one person's capital were not adding to the attractiveness of
        nation as a target. It would be interesting to know how much of the
        defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a
        self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per year on the value of all assets
        and contractual rights, to pay the costs of defense. The owner
        assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and if anyone wants
        to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There could
        be a
        personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption for
        personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of
        local police and courts.&nbsp; <span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I concede that geo-rent is a
    hypothetical. Geo-rent is based on two fictions. </small>    </div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>The first is that the site is devoid of improvements. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second is that it is being rented out. 
      </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One occasionally hears
        criticisms of geo-rent taxation like this from
        the textbook by McConnell and Brue (2005, 300): &#8220;[I]n practice it would
        be difficult to determine how much of any specific income payment
        actually amounted to [geo-rent].&#8221;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Yet, professional real estate appraisers routinely separate a
        site&#8217;s
        ground value and the improvement&#8217;s value. This separation is typically
        required for fire insurance. Banks for mortgages also commonly require
        it. These parties estimate site value as a residual after the
        replacement cost of buildings, adjusted for depreciation. This process
        is combined with computerized contour mapping of site value per square
        meter, based on actual land-sale and lease data. The computerized
        mapping works to smooth out the assessments, and can be done to
        emphasize long-term trends rather than year-by-year fluctuations in
        land values (as is done today with the assessment of property-tax).
        Adam Smith (1776) advocates geo-rent taxation (832 - 844) and explains
        that separating out the value of improvements is not that big a deal
      (833, 844).<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></small><br>

      <small>Of course this is inexact. Of course there will be judgment
        calls by
        assessors, as well as some politicking in the details. But serious
        economics is comparative. All tax rules will involve inexactness,
        judgment calls, and politicking. Let&#8217;s ask honestly how serious these
      problems are compared to other forms of taxation.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Sales, incomes, profits, imports, and estates are easily hidden.
        Deductions, cost accounting, and expenses are devilishly
        particularistic, involving whatever human activities the taxed party <span
 style="font-style: italic;">says </span>are
        involved in generating sales, income, or profits. Documentation is a
        tangle of complex record keeping, and is very difficult to make
        accountable. Documentation is easily fabricated. Enforcement is
        intrusive and encroaches on civil liberties. The dimensions of earning
        sales, income, etc. are myriad, and all call for particularistic tax
        rules, each highly subject to arbitrariness and politicking because of
      the particularism.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>By contrast, it is impossible to hide land. It is impossible to
        shrink,
        move or disguise land. Moreover, the dimensions of valuing ground space
        are relatively few. The government can set general rules that apply
        universally. In contrast to income-tax records which are for good
        reasons kept from public view, the site-value assessments for geo-rent
        would be a public record, as in fact real-estate assessments are today.
        In principle, absolutely no record keeping is required, apart from
        title to the land. Compared to taxing income, sales, estates, etc.,
        taxing geo-rent is objective, transparent, and non-intrusive. These
      virtues were emphasized by Adam Smith (1776: 848).</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Those who allege a relative difficulty in separating the value
        of land
        from the value of improvements lose sight of the main policy issue. The
        relative efficiency of tapping geo-rent is that doing so imposes no
        marginal cost on additional income, sales, or personal property.
        Condominiums
        assign to each unit a fixed percentage interest in the association,
        which is also its percentage of the assessments. This percentage
        interest is often based on the site value of the unit relative to the
        other units, i.e. its location and size, irrespective of any personal
      property inside the unit, let alone the owners&#8217; income or spending.</small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thousands of
        condominium associations are thus accomplishing what some claim is
        impractical.</span>
      They tap the site value of a unit without reducing extra income or
        burdening extra spending or possessions. Residential associations,
        hotels, and other private communities do likewise with their rental
        charges and assessments. Some private communities such as shopping
        centers do practice modern sharecropping,
        basing some of their charges on the gross revenue of the tenant shops
        as a way of sharing risks, but this is not an essential feature of
      private-community financing.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

        revenue for local public
        services that does not have these disadvantages. That way is to use a
        combination of fees for services and public collection of the rent of
    land.</b></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The rent of land is the amount
        of money that would be bid for
        the use of land in an auction.</b> It can be thought of as 100 rubles
        more than the second-highest bid, that is, the amount of money that
        the person for whom the use of land is most valuable must bid to
    outbid the person who places the second-highest value on it.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What land is worth to a person who
        wants to use it depends on the
        length of time for which he will be allowed to use it. For the
        purpose of defining rent, this length of time should be indefinitely
        long, but with provision for revising the rent as market conditions
        change. In other words, if similar land rents for 20% more three
        years from now, then the person who secures the use of a site this
    year would be required to pay that additional 20% at that time.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land also depends on
        the condition of the land. The
        rent of land is what people would bid for unimproved land. In a town,
        unimproved land is land without any structures on it. In an
        agricultural area, many things other than structures can count as
        improvements--drainage, stone removal, fertilization, leveling, etc.
        It might be hard to find agricultural land that had no such
        improvements. Thus in agricultural areas, one must subtract something
        from observed payments for the use of land, to account for the value
    that is being paid for such improvements.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The comments above describe how
        one might observe the rental value
        of land. Economics can also say something about how a bidder would
        decide how much to bid. A bidder would decide how he could use the
        land most profitably, compute the net revenue from the most
        profitable use after all costs including the cost of his own
        entrepreneurial effort and a premium for the risk to his finances,
        and what was left would be the total rent of the land for the period
        of the investment. The bidder would then estimate future rent,
        subtract that from the total rent, and what was left would be rent
        for the current period.<a href="../docs/Tideman_Farm_Rural.html"> Read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Renewal as
intensification.</b> George observed land speculation in California
when it was young and raw. Today, an equally or more baneful aspect
of underusing land is found in older blighted slums, where underuse
takes the form of non-renewal. Thus, land of high capacity is
providing only minimal service and employment. Why do we not get
timely renewal? The most obvious reason is that the sites under old
buildings bear low tax valuations, because assessors mistake the
building for the site and overlook its reuse value, or opportunity
cost. Let the owner renew the site, and taxes shoot up: not only on
the new building, but often on the site as well. Result: nonrenewal.
So capital that should go to renew these sites of high potential
migrates outward instead, to where tax rates are lower and subsidies
are higher, wasting capital in duplicating the infrastructure, and of
course also wasting land.</small><br>
<br>
<small> </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many Georgists
fail to see that a major part of the problem is
underassessment of the land. Land is underassessed when tax-valuers
lapse into using the &#8220;building-first, land-residual&#8221; method
of separating land from building values. This results in land
valuations so absurdly low that one observes, in many cities and
neighborhoods, most of the joint value of land/building being
allocated to the building in the very year that the owner chooses to
demolish the building, i.e. when the building really no longer has
any value at all. </span>Then the assessor raises the land valuation
under
the new, or replacement building &#8211; making the land tax in effect
an additional tax on the new building. The correct method is the
&#8220;land-first, building-residual&#8221; method: value the land as
though vacant, and give the old building the excess, if any, of the
joint value over the land value. Then the land value remains fixed
when a new building arises, and the land tax serves, as it should, as
a stimulus to rebuilding (Gaffney, 2001). <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The price of land is closely
related to that of adjoining land, for
they are usually near substitutes.&nbsp; Richard Hurd, pioneer author
of the classic<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Principles of
City Land Values</span> (1903), posited this rule, noting the
continuity is both concentric and axial.&nbsp; It is therefore possible
to map land values as one would map elevations, drawing contour lines
of equal unit value.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small> In dividing
value between land and a building affixed to it the standard practice
of
appraisers, and speculative buyers too, is the "building-residual
method." The land is appraised as though vacant; the building gets
the remaining value, if any.&nbsp; The building, once attached to a
specific site, loses the mobility of place and form that fluid capital
possesses and has no opportunity cost but scrap value, which is often
negative.&nbsp; Land, always lacking mobility of place, retains
mobility
of reuse because of its versatility, permanence, and irreproducible
location.... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Many buyers have little understanding of valuation theory.&nbsp;
Loan
officers should be better trained than naive new buyers, but the recent
history of U.S. and Japanese banking suggests otherwise.&nbsp; Without
understanding, there is little basis for pricing other than the
behavior of other buyers and sellers.&nbsp; "A nerd follows the
herd."&nbsp; But then valuation is purely circular and loses its anchor
in reality.&nbsp; The history of land values, accordingly, is one of
manic-depressive mob psychology with swings of high amplitude.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Suppose one decides to consult a professional real estate
appraiser, to
make sure he does not overbid.&nbsp; What do appraisers do?&nbsp; They
locate comparable properties that have sold recently, and advise you
accordingly.&nbsp; The buyers of those other properties hired
appraisers who did the same thing.&nbsp; If there is a building, he
tells you it is not worth more than its reproduction cost, a known
figure in the trade.&nbsp; With land, however, value is based mainly on
what others are paying, i.e. the general opinion.&nbsp; Everyone is
setting his watch by everyone else's.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is one important party whose following the herd will
actually
restrain the herd, and temper its excesses.&nbsp; This party is the
assessor of land taxes.&nbsp; If land assessments rise with a herd
mania, land taxes will also rise, dashing freezing water on the mania
and stabilizing the market.&nbsp; Here is compensatory fiscal policy in
the best and original sense.&nbsp; This can really work.&nbsp; It did
work in the Progressive Era, 1900-17, when reliance on property taxes
was at an all-time high in the U.S.&nbsp; The major crash that was
"due" in 1913 or so never happened.<small><span

<small><b>Use the
Building-Residual Method of Allocating Value</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is equally important to use the
"Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: the residual, if any, is
building value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuing one lot or parcel this
way, you have information needed
for valuing neighboring and other comparable parcels. Using a map
with value contours, you can value a whole city this way with
surprising ease and speed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using this method, I valued
Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?
Yes, I really said "tripled." <span style="font-weight: bold;">By his
methods, buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down. </span>Besides
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">depreciation
</span>and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">technological
obsolescence</span>, many buildings suffered
severe "<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">locational
obsolescence</span>," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using the building-residual method
requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure</span>, just as the old single-tax
campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Federal Income Taxes
</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of assessors' greatest
problems today is the strong pressures
from owners who want to allocate as much value as possible to
buildings that they may depreciate for federal income tax purposes.
Here is where we must study how the parts form the big picture. Here
is where federal and local tax policies intersect. Some Georgists
have neglected or misunderstood the income-tax treatment of land
income. Let us see how this works.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Congress and the IRS let one
depreciate buildings, but not land,
for income tax. This important distinction harks back to when the
income tax was new, and Georgist Congressmen like Warren Worth
Bailey, from Johnstown, PA and Henry George Jr., from Brooklyn were
instrumental in shaping it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a building is new, the
depreciable value is limited to the
cost of construction. The non-depreciable land is the bare land value
before construction. So far, so good. Over time, however, building
owners have converted this into a tax shelter scheme. Owner A, the
builder, writes off the building in a few years, much less than its
economic life, and sells it to B. "A" pays a tax on the excess of
sales price over "basis." The basis is reduced by all depreciation
taken, so any excess depreciation is "recaptured" upon sale. It is
defined by Congress as a "capital gain," and given the corresponding
package of tax preferences:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>deferral of tax,</small></li>
  <li><small>lower rate,</small></li>
  <li><small>step-up of basis at time of death,</small></li>
  <li><small>tax-free exchanges, etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus far, any tax preference goes
to A, the builder, and may be
seen as a wellconsidered building incentive. Watch, however, what
happens next. "<span style="font-weight: bold;">A" sells to B and B
depreciates the building all over
again, from his purchase price. To do so, B must allocate the new
"basis" - i.e., his purchase price - between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How shall B allocate the new basis?<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Enter the local tax
assessor.</span>
Here is where local assessment intersects with Federal income tax
policy. The IRS does not try to assess land and buildings. Instead,
IRS instructions tell taxpayers they may use locally assessed values
to allocate basis between depreciable buildings and non-depreciable
land. The IRS accepts this allocation as conclusive. As a result,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">local owners of income property press
their assessors to allocate as
much value as possible to buildings, and as little as possible to
land. This does not affect their local taxes, but lowers their
federal taxes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It lets them
depreciate land.</span></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Local revenues are not immediately
affected. Local assessors have
little reason not to accommodate their constituents, local
landowners, to help them depreciate land for federal and state income
tax purposes. They have little reason to use the correct
"building-residual'' method of allocating value, and a compelling
reason to use the wrong method that understates land value. Thus they
convert non-depreciable land value into depreciable building value.
It is the modern version of "competitive underassessment." In the
process, they also convert the local property tax from a land tax
into a building tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After a while B sells to C, who in
turn sells to D, so each
building is depreciated many times. So is a large part of the land
under it, time after time, although it should not be depreciated at
all. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This
is carried so far that real estate pays no federal or state
income taxes at all.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution to this lies with the
U.S. Congress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The need is to
limit depreciation to one cycle only. It is a most urgent problem for
both federal and local treasuries. </span>We all have Congressmen.
Write to
them and raise their consciousness. They are brokers who respond to
public opinion. It is we who are derelict. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Timberland owners around the
country have sold this bill of goods
to legislators. In many states, less than half the private land is
fully taxable, because of such laws. These are not all western or
southern states, either, as one might surmise. In NH, for example,
only 45 percent of the private land (and none of the Federal land) is
fully taxable. The rest is sheltered by the State's "Current Use" tax
law, their version of our TPZ law.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Advocates for these laws argue
that land taxes, accumulating with
interest over long growth periods, would eat up all the profit from
growing timber. Let us see. Taxes of $1.56 per acre per year,
accumulating over 60 years at a real interest rate of five percent,
come to $552 per acre in constant 1995 dollars. At that time the
timber stumpage will be worth about $20,000 at 1995 prices, or 36
times the accumulated future value of the land taxes. (In addition,
the investment will have served to shield the owners from the eroding
effects of inflation, a benefit assumed away by using constant
dollars. On top of that, it is a good bet the real value of timber
will have risen after 60 years of population growth.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, land taxes would have to be
36 times what they are now to
consume the whole value of timber harvests. The fact is, present
taxes are a negligible token. Timberland is effectively sheltered
from the full weight (light as it is) of the one percent property tax
imposed on ordinary land. It pays, as we have seen, only about $1.2
million a year in Mendocino County.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The acre value of timberland is
low compared with downtown values
in San Francisco, where one little square foot in the hottest spot
may fetch $2,000. That is $87 million per acre! However, there are
very few such golden acres, compared to a million acres of timberland
in Mendocino County, some 35 million acres in California, and 737
million acres in the U.s. That is 32 percent of the area of the 50
states. (The fraction of private and public land in forests is, by
coincidence, the same: 32 percent.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Owing to the success of timber
people in spreading their gospel,
almost all of their land is underassessed. Almost all state yield
taxes, imposed in lieu of property taxes on standing timber, are too
low to be revenue-neutral. Add to that, Congress since 1943 has made
timber a "capital asset" for federal (and therefore state) income
tax. Many costs of managing and carrying this capital asset are
expensible - certainly interest and property taxes are. The net
result is that timberland contributes very little to public revenues
at any level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Residents of timber counties are
typically scattered and poorly
organized. Timber companies are huge, rich, few and tightly
organized. In Mendocino County, Georgia Pacific and Louisiana
Pacific, absentee owners, together own the best 500,000 acres - 58
percent of the County's timberland - and Georgia-Pacific owns
Louisiana-Pacific. They control state forestry schools, paying
professors as consultants. They support research in forest economics
at think tanks like Resources for the Future in Washington, which has
never criticized their tax preferences but trained its big guns on
public agencies, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management. "The industry" controls tax laws in 50 states, and
sloughs tax burdens onto others. It will continue to do so until
other taxpayers in the timber counties wake up and organize to
control state timber tax laws.&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public
need to be awakened to the central role
played by taxation. They need to see that loss of our historic land tax
has made speculation our top national sport -- a treacherous one at
that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect
Paul Spreiregen):</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
There is no doubt that the present real property tax...contributes more
to depressing the standard of housing than all government housing
policies combined do to raise it. The current property tax may fairly
be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land values too lightly,
buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use, penalizes good
land use. Consider three identical homes and lots:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec
room, new roof, great landscaping.</span> The
assessor comes by and says, in effect: "As punishment for making a
showplace, and for generating jobs and profits for local businesses,
we're raising your assessment by the amount of your investments. Your
tax bill will go up, not just for a year, but for as long as you keep
the house in good condition."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his
house of the same size run down -- loose
banisters, torn screens, broken gutters, junk-filled yard. </span>The
assessor
tells him, in effect: "Because you created an eyesore for your
neighbors and an unsafe dwelling for your tenants, we're reducing your
assessment and your taxes. If your place is more dilapidated next year,
we'll reduce them even more."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his
building down; the idle lot neither houses
nor employs anybody.</span> The friendly assessor tells him, in effect:
"For
completely wasting your property, and for making no use of the
infrastructure provided for this area, we'll give you the lowest
assessment and tax bill of the three."    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples
condemn not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same
perverse property tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it
any wonder cities are torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only
the half of it. The low land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees
that the annual increase in his or her land value is greater than the
tax bill. This signals the owner to do nothing, to sit back and collect
the values generated by productive neighbors and the community.</span></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter
the supply of available sites.</span> This raises land prices further,
seducing more speculators into the land game, hastening the flight of
residents and businesses from central cities and even small towns. This
is far from the only cause of sprawl, but one of the most potent. It
cannot be stressed too much because it is one of the least recognized
causes. <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html"><span

owners</span> (and, for no visible theological reason, organized
fundamentalists). Lands in classified uses are assessed by capitalizing
their visible money income from the official use only, thus exempting
from the tax base all values from rustic manorial, recreational, and
blood-sport uses, and all speculative values based on higher future
uses. In vast rural and sylvan areas these other influences are the

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;The
taxable capacity of land is camouflaged in our times by a consistent
modern tendency to underassess it, relative to buildings.</span> There
are several studies in point. The most general one is the quinquennial
Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It actually understates the
tendency a lot, by omitting the class of land most underassessed, that
is, raw acreage in and near cities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;There is great latitude in the assessment process. This
latitude is now used to lower the fraction of the property tax base
that is listed as land value, and raise the fraction that is listed as
building value. It could just as well be used the other way, and used
to be in many cities, whenever assessors were getting that message
through the election returns. This would have roughly the same effect
as going to a two-rate system on a more formal basis -- except,
obviously, that the formal basis is more permanent, reliable, and
generally respectable.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I have here data ... I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be over
twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it should
have been 70%.&nbsp; </span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>How does one come to so startling a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What I did was study sites on the
eve of demolition. </span>When you buy an old junker to tear down and
replace with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing
that the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is a good
way to measure to what extent land is underassessed.</span></span></small><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you poke
around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the exception.
Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of it tumbledown,
commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State Building. Old as it is, it is still
nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is in a
so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
location (57th Street, I would guess). Even so, when the site and the
building sold in separate transactions a few years ago, the site
represented 1/3 of the total value. What does that say about the land
fraction on neighboring parcels, covered only with the remains of
ordinary old structures? What does that say about the land fraction
nearer the 100% location?&nbsp;<strong> ....</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>In other cases,
industries occupy land of high value that
is wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it
has not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias
of assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to
improved "lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of
wholesale discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis,
Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
<a
 href="file:///C|/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#100%25%20location">100%
location</a>, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. To make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In still other cases "industry"
surrounds and intersperses itself
with vast swaths of vacant land. They hold it for open storage,
parking, purported "future expansion," accessways, buffers, backlots,
discouragement of competitors, etc. Many of Los Angeles' swankiest
buildings of today arose over the former surplus lands of the cinema
industry, which disgorged them before 1978 because they used to have
to pay substantial taxes on surplus lands.&nbsp; <a

A GUESS IS BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL!</span></small><br>
<small>But how does anybody - professional assessor or not - possibly
put a
value on something so hard-to-value as water quality or biodiversity or
recreational use? The answer is that the valuation can't be an
accounting-style series of clear calculations, but a series of value
judgments that are, in the end, quantified. It's a guess, but the best
possible guess. And the best possible guess is better than a wild
guess. And a wild guess is better than no guess at all. And no guess at
all is pretty much what we have at the moment, as the outcome of our
present neoclassical system is that such natural benefits are often
rated as next-to-worthless, and almost given away!&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This assessment problem is
formidable, but not a reason to abandon
the effort to achieve equal rights to natural opportunities. In
principle, the pre-development value of the land beneath a city is
the difference between the rental value of the land when developed
optimally and the annual cost of that development. One might call
upon city planners or the developers of new towns to make such
estimates. Even if we could not achieve complete precision in such
estimates, we might achieve substantial agreement. It would be a
great step in the direction of equal rights to natural opportunities
if each nation were to make a declaration of the form, "This is what
we believe to be the pre-development value of our land, and of the
land in the rest of the world, and this is the basis for our
belief." </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small><b>Partial Applications -- Assessment Precision<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small>Another way to mimic a PTS is
to follow the
letter of the law in assessing site value for accuracy and currency.
Over the decades, US assessors have consistently undervalued land
relative to improvements. The more poorly the land is utilized, the
lower our officials assess it, despite uniform appraisal laws. This
bias has overemphasized the detrimental half of the tax and crippled
the beneficial part.</small></font></small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small> Consider Rosslyn, Virginia, across the
Potomac
from Washington, DC. In the late forties this part of Arlington was so
rundown it inspired an advisory group to require the state to conduct a
countywide reassessment in 1950. They stipulated that close attention
should be paid to the true market value of sites without regard to use.
Rosslyn valuations jumped; the core 154-acres saw increases from $300
to $2,300 per acre. A five-acre commercial tract jumped from $3,000 to
$196,000 an acre.
</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
How did they soften the blow to property owners? 
</small></font></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>First, all new
assessments were mailed at once; owners saw they were treated
uniformly. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Second, the assessment gurus read
the market better than
most owners; the updated assessments in Arlington rivaled the highest
in quality in the US.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Third, chief assessor, Francis
Austin, saw
himself as an educator, not an enforcer. He assisted owners to make
better land use decisions. Instead of suing, several land owners sold
their lots at healthy profits. 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>Soon new enterprises took off, turning
Rosslyn into a district of top-notch hotels, offices, and apartments.
The success was also supported by annual reevaluations. As Rosslyn land
values increased with accurate assessments, the pressure for renewal
remained and removed the profit and incentive of speculation. By 1975
Rosslyn returned $43 million annually to the county and received $13
million in public expenditures.</small></font></small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>Another outstanding example of simply
following appraisal laws is
Southfield, Michigan. State law required all taxable property to be
appraised at market value. Buildings there in 1960 were assessed at 70
to 80 percent of value and land at five to 10 percent. After Mayor S.
James Clarkson took office on a promise to correct this violation, and
after a fight with the assessor, special interest groups, and the
courts, the city stopped overvaluing new construction and remodels and
began appraising land by its highest and best use. Soon the contrast
with the slums of nearby Detroit were patent. Mayor Clarkson stated
that Detroit taxed land values "next to nil" under Depression era
assumptions. Voters reelected him four times on his promise of fair
assessments. Average homeowners paid 22 percent less in taxes
immediately. Those who held large empty lots in desirable locations saw
huge tax increases but reaped windfall profits from selling or
developing. As Detroiters migrated outward, accurate assessments
enabled Southfield to capture rising land values, bulking up its tax
base by 20 percent a year. <strong>... </strong></small></font></small></p>
<small><font size="3"><small> Most jurisdictions already appraise the
value of land and buildings separately (however poorly), a taxing body
could without delay adopt the PTS. Yet to derive maximal benefit from
the PTS, many jurisdictions will have to upgrade their assessments.</small></font></small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>In real estate there are two basic
tautologies. 
</small></font></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>One, land value is
unrealized rent and rent is realized land value. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Two, the annual rental
income from a parcel is its market price multiplied by the interest
rate, and land price is capitalized land rent (usually over a 30 year
term). Since collecting land rent shrinks, even eliminates, land price,
it becomes necessary to determine annual rent and use that as a basis
for the rate on land.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
Where density is low and growth rapid, land price inflates and
assessments usually fail to keep up. Yet when land price inflation
decreased from 15% to 10% annually, a land tax rate of 95% would
capture the gain in land value and impact land allocation. Fortunately,
the PTS precludes land price inflation, even lowers land price (tho'
high density areas being developed would likely keep prices high).
</small></font></small></p>
<small><font size="3"><small>
Where assessments are inaccurate, the PTS will be less effective. Under
valued assessments, common on large residential lots in Clark County,
Washington, <i>"produces the undesired outcome of tax reductions
rather than tax increases"</i>
(Gihring, 1996). Room for improvement persists in most regions
nationwide. How much better could today's assessments be, had state
legislatures allowed localities to abolish taxes on buildings all
together? Both the cities of Rosslyn and Southfield did in fact request
just that. In Australia, with its long history of local reliance on
site-values, accurate assessment is more the rule than the exception.</small></font><br>
<br>
Another failed practice is assessment. Now assessors must combine
building and land values and slip into evaluating by current use which
is often less than potential use. They also undervalue large lots,
vacant lots, parking lots, and underused locations. Value that should
have been assigned to the location they attribute to the building, a
capital asset which for income tax avoidance can be rapidly
depreciated, benefiting the wealthiest land owners. Thus the property
tax is made regressive.<br>
<br>
Assessing property is more laborious, infrequent, and less accurate
than simply assessing land. Freed from tallying changes in
improvements, assessors could calculate market values of locations from
actual sales or leases. Plus, assessors can turn to modern technology.
Computer aided mass appraisal (CAMA), now accepted, facilitates annual
assessments of all properties. The simpler the assessment process, the
fairer and more progressive the taxation. ... <br>

using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural

simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Nobel-winning economist
    <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William Vickrey</a> said that the property
tax is actually two different taxes (Vickrey 1991). That is because
buildings are capital, not land, in the economic sense &#8211; even
if, in most legal codes, there is no distinction between land and
improvements made to it which are all lumped together as &#8216;landed
property&#8217; or real estate. Buildings and other improvements to
land all depreciate over time unless further capital is expended.
Eventually the market value of such <i>improvements</i> may become
negative, owing to the costs that would need to be incurred by
someone wishing to redevelop the site for an alternative use. But
that does not necessarily take away the rental value of the
<i>site</i>.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much urban blight is caused by
these so-called &#8216;brown

valuable locations, with good transport connections. It may be that
owners are speculating that land prices will rise and enable them to
sell at greater profit in the future than now, or it may be that
there is genuinely no market for sites in a particular location
unless the cost of remediation is subsidised as a form of public
investment. Such investment, according to Vickrey and other followers
of Henry George, can be entirely funded from LVT. In a lecture given
in 1991, first published last year, Vickrey claimed:</small></p>

capacity to be fully self-financing without dependence on either
federal assistance or on general taxes that are unrelated to benefits
received.&#8221;</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proviso, according to Vickrey,
is to replace the tax on
buildings with a tax on land value alone &#8211; LVT:-</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;The property tax
combines one of the best and one of the worst taxes we have. The

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing

property tax revenue from extending the tax base to sites that are
currently under-taxed (because the tax is based primarily on

    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An <em>ad valorem</em> tax is administered by having assessors who estimate
    the sale value of land. When tax rates are modest, it is easy enough for
    assessors to do this by monitoring sales of land that is vacant or has only
    structures
    that are about to be demolished. However, if
  the rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax is very high, then the influence of
  inherent value of land will be overwhelmed in prices by idiosyncratic features
  of transactions
  between particular buyers and sellers. Assessors would need to rely on processes
  in which sale prices were
  linked directly to taxes. These could be either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">auctions</span>, where participants knew that the
  auction result would be used to set the
  tax for a specified period, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">options</span>,
  where potential uses of land offered specified payments for any site meeting
  certain standards.
  Because <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on land have no distorting effects, they
  neither retard nor advance the timing of land development in a world of perfect
  information.
  This has been denied by Shoup (1970, p. 38-39), Bentick (1979, pp. 861-63;
  1982) and a variety of other writers who have followed them. The tax that Shoup
  and
  Bentick
  analyze, however, is not an <em>ad valorem</em> tax, but rather a tax whose
  base is the present value of the future net income that is expected to result
  from
  the plans for a site. Thus a change in the plan produces a change in the tax
  bill, generating an incentive for
  inefficient changes in plans (Tideman, 1982). ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read

    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
    the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
    oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5 to
    1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9 And in view of the fact
    that assessments in New York localities have historically been very infrequent,
    one can understand how the land values are in reality a far higher proportion
    of parcel value than assessments would suggest.10 This means that in a period
    of seven years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
    by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to be illustrative.
    Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their rates of change during
    this time span; upstate New York was largely stable, but downstate localities
    experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
  <p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
    view&#8221; of property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the
    burden of the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital in the
    form of a lower net return instead of being shifted to users of property
    in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11 Proponents point out that &#8220;the
    tax on improvements is essentially a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and
    therefore] its incidence will depend on the characteristics of supply and
    demand for capital nationally rather than on a single market.&#8221;12 The
    effect of this is to make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;13 Nonetheless,
    in a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old
    view&#8221; in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that
    the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific
    state (underlining in original). Thus, the old or traditional view was adhered
    to in the analysis. . ; that is, the excise effect of the tax was considered
    dominant.&#8221;14 The ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has
    over 1,300 local assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their
    notice. ...</p>
  <p><br>
    Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
      sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or
      two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to
      the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in
      land.<strong> American cities today typically record aggregate assessed
      land values &#8211; at
      least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of
      total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings taken together</strong>.31 Skyscrapers
      reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
      because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market
      price from the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive
      market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a
      penalty on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their
      maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden
      would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for
      their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
      challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
      particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes,
      evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated
      with administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve
      disputes over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.<strong> The
    technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    </strong>Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
    for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This paper describes systems for assigning rental value to land through markets
    for the use of land that are created and managed by government officials. The
    central idea of the paper is that the full rent of land can be collected while
    achieving an efficient allocation of land if the rent for improved sites is
    revised annually, based on offers for the use of similar unimproved sites for
    the current year. The efficient allocation of land requires neither the sale
    of land
  nor leases of long duration at fixed rents.</p>
  <p>Two systems for assigning rental value to land are presented. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One system employs a market in which land is actually
      turned over to bidders for their use, while the other employs a market in
      options to use land. </span>While these systems are applicable in many settings,
      they are particularly applicable to current conditions in the Soviet Union,
      where land is being transferred from public to private management. The new
      manager of each site will receive the profit or bear the loss from production
      on that site. The main question under consideration concerns the process
      to be used to determine how much must be paid for the use of each site.</p>
  <p>A standard response of economists to such questions is, "Sell everything to
    the highest bidder." In the context of land in the Soviet Union, this would
    mean selling, for a lump-sum amount, the right to use each site into the
    indefinite future. However, for a number of reasons, such an approach is
    less attractive
    than selling the right to use sites for rent to be paid annually. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, the person who can make best use of the site may be unable to
      match a purchase bid from someone else, because of unequal access to lending
      markets
          (due to inequalities in wealth, for example). Selling land-use rights
      for annual rent makes sites more available to users with relatively little
      in
          assets. </li>
    <li>Second, uncertainty about future political conditions would tend to depress
          purchase offers. Selling land-use rights for annual rent requires the
      state to accept the risk of future unfavorable public policies, and thereby
      tends
          to promote favorable future conditions. </li>
    <li>Third, the high degree of general uncertainty about future economic conditions
          can lead to offers of less than the expected value of opportunities,
      simply because people have no idea how to guess what the opportunities
      are worth.
          Selling land-use rights on an annual basis permits many of the future
      uncertainties to be resolved before bids must be made. </li>
    <li>Finally, the returns from future use of a site can more justly be claimed
          by future generations than by the present generation. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Selling land-use rights for annual rent allows each year's population to
    claim that year's rent. While the proceeds of sales can be invested for the
    benefit
    of future generations, not collecting the money in advance helps preserve
    the heritage of the future against political predations. For all of these
    reasons,
    I assume that what is desired is not a purchase price but a rental price
    to be assigned to each site for each year. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read
