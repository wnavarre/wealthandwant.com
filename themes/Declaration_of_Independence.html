      <p>It isn't news that the process of living up to the
        truths America's founding fathers held to be self-evident is not yet
        complete. But some people appear to think we're getting pretty close,
        and seek to <a href="Conservatism.html">conserve</a> the system we've
        got, unwilling to consider the possibility that we are falling short

      <p>Our founding fathers were all large landowners, and it would not have
        occurred to them to limit the rights of landholders in any way. But at
        a time when there was still an open &#8212; seemingly limitless&#8212;        frontier, their perceptions might have been affected by that. But they

      <p>Only 100 years later, with changes in technology and the closing of
        the frontier, Henry George saw significant poverty in America's

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Evidently this regard for the general good is the true principle of taxation.
    The more it is examined the more clearly it will be seen that there is no
    valid reason why we should, in any case, attempt to tax all property. That
    equality should be the rule and aim of taxation is true, and this for the
    reason given in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created
    equal. But equality does not require that all men should be taxed alike,
    or that all things should be taxed alike. It merely requires that whatever
    taxes are imposed shall be equally imposed upon the persons or things in
    like conditions or situations; it merely requires that no citizen shall be
    given an advantage, or put at a disadvantage, as compared with other citizens.</p>
  <p> The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the
    Constitution of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence.
    To insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to
    each individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit
    of happiness &#8212; these are the proper ends of government, and are therefore
    the ends which in every scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.<br />
    <br />
  As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
  limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if the
  increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could not
  be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
  Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
  and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained in
  this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York a more
  desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and light could
  be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied to each house
  at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual effort,
  or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to give every
  one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average resident,
  the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be increased
  burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York would become
  a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn taxation as bad
  merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional provision,
  as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our States has
  been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction upon
  the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is the far-reaching
  statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his proposition that
  all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain brief term &#8212; a
  proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth that the earth belongs
  in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have no control over it, and can
  give no title to any part of it. But restriction upon public debts is a very
  different thing from restriction upon the power of taxation, and reasons which
  urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor is increased taxation necessarily
  proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in taxation is in the order of
  social development, for the reason that social development tends to the doing
  of things collectively that in a ruder state are done individually, to the
  giving to government of new functions and the imposing of new duties. Our public
  schools and libraries and parks, our signal service and fish commissions and
  agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations, are evidences of this.</p>
  <p> But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt.<br />
    <br />
  Now discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to equally
  tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the true rule, that
  taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion of the general prosperity,
  the securing of substantial equality, and the recognition of inalienable rights,
  let us consider upon what species of property it may be best laid. ...</p>
  <p>... The possession of wealth is the
  inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance of wealth.
  Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things their work
  will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion is to lessen
  the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to the possessor,
  which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth, there is a benefit
  to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be, it is utterly impossible
  for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit of any desirable thing
  he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized give value to land,
  and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing the incentive to production.</p>
  <p> To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p> See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p> Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p> So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p> Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the

    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. <strong>Equality of political
      rights will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty
      of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages.</strong> This is the truth that we have ignored. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. </strong>This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe
        forbid it.</strong> Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that
        is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something grander
        than Benevolence, something more
      august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
      to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
      come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays on
      Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. ...</p>
  <p> Between democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there
      is an irreconcilable conflict. Here in the United States, as there in Europe,
      it may be seen arising.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying
          the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read

  <p>I begin the publication of this paper in response to many urgent requests,
      and because I believe that there is a field for a journal that shall serve
      as a focus for news and opinions relating to the great movement, now beginning,
      for the emancipation of labor by the restoration of natural rights.</p>
  <p>The generation that abolished chattel slavery is passing away, and the political
      distinctions that grew out of that contest are becoming meaningless. The work
      now before us is the abolition of industrial slavery.</p>
  <p>What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of
      all; what is produced by the individual belongs rightfully to the individual.
      The neglect of these simple principles has brought upon us the curse of widespread
      poverty and all the evils that flow from it. Their recognition will abolish
      poverty, will secure to the humblest independence and leisure, and will lay
      abroad and strong foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure
      the full recognition of these principles is the most important task to which
      any man can address himself today. It is in the hope of aiding in this work
      that I establish this paper.</p>
  <p>I believe that the Declaration of Independence is not a mere string of glittering
      generalities. I believe that all men are really created equal, and that the
      securing of those equal natural rights is the true purpose and test of government.
      And against whatever law, custom or device that restrains men in the exercise

  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build schools and

Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity of private property in
land, increased education can effect nothing for mere laborers, for as
education is diffused the wages of education sink!</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Establish hospitals?&nbsp;</span>
Why, already it seems to laborers that there are too many seeking work,
and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure!</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build model tenements?</span>&nbsp;

he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodation he brings more
to seek employment, and cheapens wages!</small></li>

He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as
between the upper and the nether millstone!</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Promote emigration from
places where wages are low to places where they are somewhat higher?</span>&nbsp;
If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate will soon
turn on him and demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
reducing their wages!</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give away what land he
may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let it at lower rents than
the market price?&nbsp;</span>
He will simply make new landowners or partial landowners; he may make
some individuals the richer, but he will do nothing to improve the
general condition of labor.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Or, bethinking himself of
those
public-spirited citizens of classic times who spent great sums in
improving their native cities, shall he try to beautify the city of his
birth or adoption?</span>&nbsp; Let him widen and straighten narrow and
crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let him open
tramways and bring in railways, or in any way make beautiful and
attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not be
that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Will it not
be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of his
benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to
landowners?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why, even the
mere announcement that he is going to do such things will start
speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What, then, can the rich man do
to improve the condition of labor?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He can do nothing at
all
except to use his strength for the abolition of the great primary wrong
that robs men of their birthright.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The justice of God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute
anything else for it!</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In speaking of measures for
improving social conditions, it
seems to us that in the teachings of morality is to be found the
highest practicality, and that the question, What is wise may always
safely be subordinated to the question, what is right?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But expressed moral truths are
deprived of all practical
meaning when accompanied by unjust sanctions as when the American
people, while they legalised chattel slavery, were accustomed to read

and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What did this truth mean on the
lips of men who asserted that
one man was the rightful property of another man who had bought him,
who asserted that the slave was robbing the master in running away, and
that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive to escape, or even
gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was an accessory to
theft, on whose head the penalties of the State should be visited?

    and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">I'm here today as a &quot;Single Taxer&quot;. If you don't
      recall quite what that is, let me first say that it&#8217;s NOT Steve Forbes&#8217;s &#8220;flat
      tax!&#8221; No. The Single Tax is actually a comprehensive program for
      economic justice and environmental sustainability. It was stated most memorably
      by
      the American economist Henry George in his 1879 book <em><a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress
      and Poverty</a></em> &#8212; and affirmed by a great many important thinkers,
      before and since. The idea is for society to collect the rental value of
      land for public revenue &#8212; and to abolish all other taxes on the production
      and exchange of wealth. It came to be known at the &#8220;Single Tax&#8221; because
      of this proposal that the rent of land should be the sole source of public
      revenue. </div>
  <p> Single Taxers have been ridiculed somewhat, over the years, for peddling
    a panacea, offering a cure for poverty, depressions, urban blight, potholes,
    the common cold and the heartbreak of psoriasis. Well, I don&#8217;t claim
    to have a cure for every bad thing. But I do want to talk to you making the
    necessary economic arrangements to create a just society, in which there would
    be equal opportunity for all, and in which we could confidently look ahead
    to all our children&#8217;s futures. </p>
  <p> Single taxers have also caught some grief for always saying &#8220;It&#8217;s
    all about the land!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But I&#8217;m not going to apologize for that! I want to explain to you
    why the issues of economic justice and sustainability actually ARE all about
    the
      land.</p>
  <p>The theme of this week&#8217;s program is Land and Justice. Those are two
      words that we use so often that we tend to take their meanings for granted.
      It might be helpful to stop and think about what they truly mean.</p>
  <p> Justice is often seen as the fair retribution for something done wrong,
    as in &quot;justice was done&quot; when a criminal is sent to jail. George
    W. Bush vowed, for example, to bring the 9-11 terrorists to justice.</p>
  <p> However, that conception of justice &#8212; in which one does good, in order
    to avoid the consequences of not doing good &#8212; is actually an immature
    one. In the stages of moral development identified by psychologist Lawrence
    Kohlberg, this is called the &quot;conventional&quot; stage. Maturity comes
    in the &quot;post-conventional&quot; stage, when we come to value doing good
    so as to contribute to our community, or, even, doing good for its own sake.</p>
  <p> Jesus was hip to that, in his scorn for the loudly-praying pharisees on
    the street corners. They already have their reward, he said. He set much
    greater
    store by good deeds done without thought of reward: &quot;whatever you do to
    the least of my brothers and sisters, you to do me also.&quot; And, even more
    to the point, the prophet Micah enjoins us to &quot;Do justice and love mercy.&quot;</p>
  <p> So, what is &quot;doing justice,&quot; in this positive sense? If I do
    something nice for the least of my brothers and sisters, have I done justice?
    If I send
    them a handmade quilt?</p>
  <p> Not really. I think the least of my brothers and sisters, cold though they
    might be, would resent my presuming to know exactly how to handle their problem;
    perhaps they'd rather make their own quilt, or build a fireplace, or move to
    a warmer place.</p>
  <p> Justice must have to do with freedom. To do justice, then, is to secure,
    in Thomas Jefferson's words, people's inalienable rights: life, liberty and
    the pursuit of happiness.</p>
  <p> The most basic of those rights is life. (In this day and age, though, even
      that is controversial... There's a great deal of passionate contention
    about the troubling special cases of the very beginning, or the very end
    of life &#8212; but
      it seems to me that we ought to pay more attention to every single human
    being's right to live!)</p>
  <p> Be that as it may: we all pretty much understand basically what human life
    is, and what its basic requirements are: food, clothing and shelter. <strong>... </strong></p>
  <p>Now it is interesting to note that the economic vision presented in the
    bible is not a precursor of communism. Two of the ten commandments explicitly
    support
    the institution of private property, and the prophets consistently railed
    against landlords and rulers who robbed the people of the fruits of their
    labor. The
    laws of Leviticus, which Jesus said he &quot;came not to destroy but to fulfill,&quot; envisioned
    a community in which everyone was secure in his own home and property, &quot;beneath
  his vine and fig tree&quot;. </p>
  <p> (Incidentally, the quote on the American Liberty Bell, from Leviticus,
    chapter 25, was a direct reference to these principles : &quot;Proclaim liberty throughout
    the land and to all the people thereof.&quot; It was a reference to the Jubilee,
    and the freedom it provided was from debt and servitude.)</p>
  <p> The division is clear: there is to be a sacred right of private property
    in the things that are made by people. But people were not to own the things
    that were made by God. The 7th commandment sums up both principles in 4 words: <em>Thou
    shalt not steal</em>.</p>
  <p> Modern society has looked away from these principles, calling them quaint,
    naive, inapplicable to the complexities of our time &#8212; yet, modern society
    finds itself mired in chronic economic and social problems for which it can
    find no solutions &#8212; and which threaten to pull down all the advances
    of civilization into a dark age &#8212; occasioned by some combination of
    war, financial implosion or ecological collapse. </p>
  <p> If there is any way out of this dark future, it can only come by way of solving
    the problem of land and justice. </p>
  <p> Fortunately, there exists a plan for that. </p>
  <p> This plan takes the shape of a &quot;fiscal reform&quot;, because it applies
    a definition of the relationship between the individual and the society that
    is consistent with both economic efficiency and moral law. It calls for us
    to respect the right of labor to create and to save wealth, and we acknowledge
    that the value of land is created not by its &#8220;owners&#8221;, but by
    the entire community. </p>
  <p>Therefore, we will abolish all taxes on income, products and sales &#8212; and
      collect the full rental value of land and other natural resources for public
      revenue.<strong> ...</strong> </p>
  <p>Eventually, I believe that human society will adopt the biblical and georgist
    wisdom, and organize itself as it must, to achieve justice, efficiency and
  sustainability. </p>
  <p> Eventually we will have tried everything else. That's how Clarence Darrow &#8212; one
    of the reform's many prominent supporters &#8212; saw things. He said this: &#8220;The &#8220;single
    tax&#8221; is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to carry into effect
    that I have no doubt that it will be about the last reform the world will
    ever get.
    People in this world are not often logical.&#8221;</p>
  <p> True enough. Yet I have to believe that eventually the obvious truth will
    start to dawn on us. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
 Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I want to impress upon those who
    may read this book is this:</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The land question is nowhere a mere local question; it is a universal
      question. It involves the great problem of the distribution of wealth,
      which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by measures which in their nature can have but
    local application. It can be settled only by measures which in their nature
    will apply everywhere.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by half-way measures. It can be settled only
    by the acknowledgment of equal rights to land. Upon this basis it can be
    settled easily and permanently.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If the Irish reformers take this ground, they will make their fight
    the common fight of all the peoples; they will concentrate strength and divide
    opposition. They will turn the flank of the system that oppresses them, and
    awake the struggle in its very intrenchments. They will rouse against it
    a force that is like the force of rising tides.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the men of Ireland to do is to proclaim, without limitation
    or evasion, that the land, of natural right, is the common property of the
    whole people, and to propose practical measures which will recognize this
    right in all countries as well as in Ireland.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the Land Leagues of the United States to do is to announce
    this great principle as of universal application; to give their movement
    a reference to America as well as to Ireland; to broaden and deepen and strengthen
    it by making it a movement for the regeneration of the world &#8211; a movement
    which shall concentrate and give shape to aspirations that are stirring among
    all nations.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Ask not for Ireland mere charity or sympathy. Let her call be the
    call of <strong>fraternity</strong>: "For yourselves, O brothers, as well
    as for us!" Let her rallying cry awake all who slumber, and rouse to a common
    struggle all who are oppressed. Let it breathe not old hates; let it ring
    and echo with the new hope!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>In many lands her sons are true to her; under many skies her daughters
    burn with the love of her. Lo! the ages bring their opportunity. Let those
    who would honor her bear her banner to the front!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The harp and the shamrock, the golden sunburst on the field of living
    green! emblems of a country without nationality; standard of a people downtrodden
    and oppressed! The hour has come when they may lead the van of the great
    world-struggle. Types of harmony and of ever-springing hope, of light and
    of life! The hour has come when they may stand for something higher than
    local patriotism; something grander than national independence. The hour
    has come when they may stand forth to speak the world's hope, to lead the
    world's advance!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Torn away by pirates, tending in a strange land a heathen master's
    swine, the slave boy, with the spirit of Christ in his heart, praying in
    the snow for those who had enslaved him, and returning to bring to his oppressors
    the message of the gospel, returning with good to give where evil had been
    received, to kindle in the darkness a great light&#8211;this is Ireland's
    patron saint. In his spirit let Ireland's struggle be. Not merely through
    Irish vales and hamlets, but into England, into Scotland, into Wales, wherever
    our common tongue is spoken, let the torch be carried and the word be preached.
    And beyond! The brotherhood of man stops not with differences of speech any
    more than with seas or mountain-chains. A century ago it was ours to speak
    the ringing word. Then it was France's. Now it may be Ireland's, if her sons
    be true.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But wherever, or by whom, the word must be spoken, the standard will
    be raised. No matter what the Irish leaders do or do not do, it is too late
    to settle permanently the question on any basis short of the recognition
    of equal natural right. And, whether the Land Leagues move forward or slink
    back, the agitation must spread to this side of the Atlantic. The Republic,
    the true Republic, is not yet here. But her birth-struggle must soon begin.
    Already, with the hope of her, men's thoughts are stirring.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Not a republic of landlords and peasants; not a republic of millionaires
    and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and some serve. But
    a republic of equal citizens, where competition becomes cooperation, and
    the interdependence of all gives true independence to each; where moral progress
    goes hand in hand with intellectual progress, and material progress elevates
    and enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>And the gospel of deliverance, let us not forget it: it is the gospel
    of love, not of hate. He whom it emancipates will know neither Jew nor Gentile,
    nor Irishman nor Englishman, nor German nor Frenchman, nor European nor American,
    nor difference of color or of race, nor animosities of class or condition.
    Let us set our feet on old prejudices, let us bury the old hates. There have
    been "Holy Alliances" of kings. Let us strive for the Holy Alliance of the
    people.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberty, equality, fraternity! Write
    them on the banners. Let them be for sign and countersign. Without equality,
    liberty cannot be; without fraternity, neither equality nor liberty can be
    achieved.</span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Liberty&#8211;the full freedom of each bounded only by the equal
      freedom of every other!</small></li>
  <li><small>Equality&#8211;the equal right of each to the use and enjoyment
      of all natural opportunities, to all the essentials of happy, healthful,
      human life!</small></li>
  <li><small>Fraternity&#8211;that sympathy which links together those who struggle
      in a noble cause; that would live and let live; that would help as well
      as be helped; that, in seeking the good of all, finds the highest good
      of each!</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"By this sign shall ye conquer!"</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>"We hold these truths to be self-evident&#8211;that all men are

      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>It is over a century since these words rang out. It is time
          to give them their full, true meaning. Let the standard be lifted that
          all may see it; let the advance be sounded that all may hear it. Let
          those who would fall back, fall back. Let those who would oppose, oppose.

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Idea of Birthrights</p>
  <p>John Locke&#8217;s response to royalty&#8217;s claim of divine right was
    the idea of everyone&#8217;s inherent right to life, liberty, and property.
    Thomas Jefferson, in drafting America&#8217;s Declaration of Independence,
    changed Locke&#8217;s trinity to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
    These, Jefferson and his collaborators agreed, are gifts from the creator
    that can&#8217;t be taken away. Put slightly differently, they&#8217;re universal
    birthrights.</p>
  <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant bones. They
    guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process, habeas corpus, speedy
    public trials, and secure homes and property. Wisely, the Ninth Amendment
    affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
    shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#8221; In
    that spirit, others have since been added.</p>
  <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
    see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against the state.
    The second included rights against unequal treatment based on race, nationality,
    gender, or sexual orientation. The third wave &#8212; which, historically
    speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists of rights not against things,
    but for things &#8212; free public education, collective bargaining for wages,
    security in old age. They can be thought of as rights necessary for the pursuit
    of happiness.</p>
  <p>What makes this latest wave of birthrights strengthen community is their
    universality. If some Americans could enjoy free public education while others
    couldn&#8217;t, the resulting inequities would divide rather than unite us
    as a nation. The universality of these rights puts everyone in the same boat.
    It spreads risk, responsibility, opportunity, and reward across race, gender,
    economic classes, and generations. It makes us a nation rather than a collection
    of isolated individuals.</p>
  <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from the corporate
    sector. The starting condition for the corporate sector, as we&#8217;ve seen,
    is that the top 5 percent owns more shares than everyone else. The starting
    condition for the commons sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property.</p>
  <p>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers, distinguished
    between pre distribution of property and re distribution of income. Under
    income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and transferred
    to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t popular with winners,
    who tend to control government and the media. Under property pre distribution,
    by contrast, the playing field is leveled by spreading property ownership
    before income is generated. After that, there&#8217;s no need for income
    redistribution; property itself distributes income to all. According to Rawls,
    while income re distribution creates dependency, property predistribution
    empowers.</p>
  <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property from some
    and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth that
    already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing) some of
    that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons, we need
    to propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth now. This twenty-first
    century necessity means we have a chance to save the planet, and as a bonus,
    add a universal birthright. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
