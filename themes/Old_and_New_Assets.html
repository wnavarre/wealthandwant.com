<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old
    Land and New Assets</span>  </div>
  <p>When we fail to make the critical distinction between land and capital, we
    get into all sorts of problems and fallacies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The Partiality of
    Indexing Capital Gains</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We surely agree with Roberts et
al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. <strong><em>Here, however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</em></strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To handle this matter we need two
semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth (although it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>]</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To
signalize these differences I use the present participle "investing,"
rather than the ambiguous noun "investment."&nbsp;<b> </b><i
 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span><b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every Keynesian also knew in 1961
that investment means net,
positive-sum investing. It does not include buying and selling
existing assets like land: these are zero-sum transactions,
macro-economically non-functional and barren. [Keynes, although
careless of consistency, generally took care to distinguish old and new
assets. " ... the competition of a high interest-rate on mortgages may
well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of wealth from
current investment in newly produced capital-assets as high interest
rates on long-term debts ... " <small>[<i>General Theory, 1936, p.
241.] The old macro-economists generally refer to investing in newly
produced assets as "income- creating expenditure," which is clear and
correct, but too much of a mouthful.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I use "investing" only
in the sense of net, income-creating, job-making spending.<small> [<i>Note
the difference between real turnover and mere ownership turnover.
Ownership turnover generates no income (except for brokers and M&amp;A
personnel) and creates no capital. Real turnover also creates no
capital, but does forward supplies of goods to consume, and flows of
investing to produce replacement goods. Most of gross investing is
reinvesting funds received or anticipated from sales of old capital
(including inventories, which turn fast, and "fixed" capital which
turns slowly as it depreciates and the funds are reinvested).</i>]<b>
</b></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Heller and his contemporaries also
knew that the incentive
driving job-making investing is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRORAT,
the Marginal Rate of Return
after Taxes. </span><small>[<i>Economists of the 1960s, following
Keynes, called it the MEC, or "Marginal Efficiency of Capital," an
awkward phrase now little used. Awkward or not, and intended or not, it
had great historical consequence by putting the emphasis where it
belongs, on marginal rates of return, excluding rents.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The marginal idea is pivotal. The
Average ROR includes
rents; the Marginal ROR is the pure return to new investment, Keynes'
"inducement to invest," which is activating and functional.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These Heller ideas were invoked
again by supply-siders in
early Reagan times. However, policy over the course of the 80s lost
the substance of that policy, keeping only the guise. Domestic
leaders forgot the usage of "investment" in macro-economics. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They
gradually slipped into an illusion that buying and holding and
bidding up old assets like non-reproduceable lands and stocks would
make jobs and produce goods. They forgot to distinguish old from new
assets, and marginal from average returns on investment (average
returns, recall, include rents). Both critics and supporters of
"supply-side" policies now darken counsel by debating current
policies in supply-side terms, when the terms no longer describe the
policy at issue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Along with normal confusion,
there is intelligence behind
such error. The case for downtaxing gains depends in part on
exploiting confusion, in order to pass off rent-raising as an
incentive for saving and investing, and so to disguise its
non-functionality and eminent taxability. The policy is called
"supply side," but isn't. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The litmus test of the sincerity
of capital-formation champions is
their treatment of irreproduceable land. Raising rents and land
prices, and protecting the gains from taxation, is purely
distributive, with no power to foster saving and investing. On the
contrary, a higher share for rent and/or land purchase must mean a
lower share for the investor in new capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ignoring land and its distinctive
attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.[<i>Brookings' major contribution to
our subject is Henry Aaron (ed), 1976, Inflation and the Income Tax,
with chapters by 15 eminent economists. Land is treated by none and is
not in the index. [It is mentioned in passing only by one, George Lent.]</i>]&nbsp;
