and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If we just look at the &quot;ecological footprint,&quot; it's easy to be scared
    of the seemingly unavoidable damage we are doing to the earth. But seeing &quot;the
    footprint&quot; in terms of its components &#8212; subsistence, wealth, and
    illth &#8212; makes it clear that the fact of persistent and growing global
    poverty is not the inevitable result of population growth. I believe it&#8217;s
    true that the world cannot long support current levels of pollution, waste
    and habitat destruction &#8212; but these problems spring not from production
    itself &#8212; and certainly not from trade, itself &#8212; but from privileges,
    granted to individuals and corporations &#8212; things that we can correct,
  if we choose to.</p>
  <p> To solve the problem of land and justice is to remove unjust privilege, by
    instituting an economic system that rewards production and prohibits extortion. </p>
  <p><strong>It&#8217;s all about the land: not only is land necessary for all life &#8212; land
      is also necessary for all production. So, as human population increases, and
      as the production of wealth gets more and more efficient, the demand for land
      goes up, and, of course, the land factories start cranking out more land!</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Wait! They can't DO that, can they? </strong></p>
  <p><strong> Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by
      human beings. If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers
      will make
    more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot be
    increased. If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen: its
    price will go up. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
    no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an immediate
    need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait, because they
    expect the land's value to increase with time.</strong></p>
  <p> That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem
    of poverty. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

  Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a Distinctive
  Factor of Production</a><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The initial distribution of land
- the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land. What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles (e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, radio, landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money.</span>
Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.&nbsp;</span><big style="font-weight: bold;"> </big><a

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Landownership
imparts superior
bargaining power</span></small><br>
<small>Labor starves, in contests of endurance; land endures. </small><br>
<br>
<small>A landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she
can earn
income like any worker.&nbsp; Landownership gives income above that,
which
gives discretionary spending or waiting power.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In contests with capital, land
has the
greater waiting power because
over time capital depreciates, while land appreciates.&nbsp; Thus
landowners
(when free of heavy taxation) are noted for their patience.&nbsp;
Patience
is the essence of bargaining power.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Because land is fixed, more ownership by one person or group
means less
ownership by others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt, unavoidably.&nbsp;
Thus, the
expanding agent necessarily weakens others by the same stroke that
strengthens himself.&nbsp; Landownership often gives market power in
the
sale of specific commodities and services.&nbsp;</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<small>Now consider the market for land titles.&nbsp; This is the more
relevant market as to building, transferring land between uses, and
changing parcel sizes.&nbsp; If the market for land services is slow,
the market for land titles is viscous.&nbsp; There is no flow of
supply, none at all.&nbsp; There is no real turnover in the sense of
producing and using up.&nbsp; There is only ownership turnover: the
market only transfers existing titles.&nbsp; (There is a supplemental
market in long leases, not addressed here.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are few highly motivated sellers, as there are motivated
sellers of spoiling produce and obsolescing computers and
vehicles.&nbsp; Median home-owners are motivated, when transferred to
another region.&nbsp; Few other land sellers come close to that degree
of motivation (and the median home represents more capital than
land).&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital depreciates;
goods spoil and obsolesce; idle labor starves; but land silently rises
in value.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The aggregate of all land changes hands slowly, with one or two
percent turnover of ownership annually (measuring the stock by value,
not number of parcels - smaller, cheaper parcels turn faster).&nbsp;
But buyers often need adjacent land, or land in particular districts or
with particular qualities, and find little or no land on the market, or
land controlled by one seller.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The slow ownership turnover cited above applies to total real
estate, i.e. land including any buildings on it.&nbsp; Ownership
turnover is even slower for bare land.&nbsp; If the average building
lasts 50 years, only 2% of the land is available for re-use in any
given year.&nbsp; Only a fraction of that 2% is for sale; the rest is
renewed by the same owner.&nbsp; Whoever wants to buy available land in
any particular area is unlikely to be faced with the "many sellers"
premised by the competitive model.... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Pseudo-Socialism is what
happens when resources in the
public domain are leased below a market rental, giving away part of
the public interest. </i></b>That has the effect of installing the
lessee as though he were the owner. The BLM, leasing grazing
privileges on Federal lands in the west, has fallen into this pattern
conspicuously and notoriously, subject to pressure from western
Senators who have the power of many votes in the U.S. Senate relative
to their state populations. The dollar values are small, but the
object lesson is visible, depressing, and cautionary. </small>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Some other bad examples are <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">school
section lands</span> in the middle
states. These originated as Federal land grants intended to support
local schools. Some of them are corruptly let to insiders in
"sweetheart deals" for token rents. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Another bad example is the County
of Los Angeles, which owns lands in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Marina del Rey district</span>. One
parcel lay idle for 25 years in the control of a politically
well-connected developer who finally went bankrupt and walked away
from it, leaving unpaid even the token rent charged. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A third bad
example is ironic: Fairhope, AL, founded and chartered specifically
as a "single-tax colony," to exemplify the principles of Henry
George. The Fairhope Corporation owns the land and collects the
ground rent for public purposes. However, when a new generation arose
"that knew not Joseph" it proved politically impossible to keep
colony ground rents up to market. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another
aspect of Pseudo-Socialism,
practised by Interior
Secretary James Watt, is to offer for immediate sale, for spot cash,
much more than the current market can absorb.</span> For example, in
April,
1982, Interior leased out coal reserves in the Powder River Basin of
Wyoming and Montana. The sale comprised 1.6 billion tons, at 3.5
cents/ton. Leases were for 50 years, with few development
requirements. The industry already had a 200 year supply under lease,
with the result that few bid, and they bid low. The winning bidders
were a tiny number of huge corporations, those with slack money to
buy reserves for the far future. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Meantime, on the <b
 style="font-weight: bold;">Outer Continental Shelf (OCS</b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">)</span>, a billion
acres (ten times the area of California) was to be leased before
1984. Before that, major oil firms had about 1/5 of that area under
lease, looking many years or several decades ahead of need. This
helps explain why a recent Alaska sale, an old Naval Petroleum
Reserve (NPR 4), fetched only 14% of the anticipated amount. </small></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Who buys to hold these vast
reserves for distant future use? They
are of investment grade only for those with waiting power.</span>
Unripe
lands and resources are probably the most closely held assets there
are. Poor people and small businessmen need busy capital right now.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Only a few of the wealthiest people
have the deep pockets and slack
money to buy far ahead, to maintain high reserve/output ratios. These
markets in far future values are their special preserve.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is being bought? Are these
not "leases," contracts to pay
rent? No, these leases are not that. Here is the heart of
Pseudo-Socialism. The U.S. Government leases mineral-prone lands
under the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Bid System</span>,"
whereby most of the payment is required
up front in spot cash. This makes a "lease" more like a sale, a sale
in which buyers are screened by their banking connections rather than
by their ability to find and produce hydrocarbons.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Irvine Company</span>. In Orange County
    the remaining developable land is in a very few "strong,
  patient" hands. Smallholdings were sold and developed early. The largest holder
  is the Irvine Company, which is now led by Donald Bren of Newport Beach, the
  30th richest American on Forbes' list. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The holding is variously
  listed at 68,000 acres to 80,000 acres, about 1/6
  of all the land in Orange County.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> Most
  of it is still undeveloped.<br>
  <br>
  It was a Spanish land grant that got its Scotch name when James Irvine married
  into the family. It was tied up for years by the trustees of the Irvine Estate,
  according to various lawsuits and public statements of heiress Joan Irvine Smith
  of Middleburg, Virginia. Control passed to a Michigan group led by Henry Ford
  II and William Taubman and Max
  Fisher of Michigan, and more recently to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Donald Bren</span> of Newport Beach. Bren is a major
  contributor to Republican Party campaigns, as O'Neill (of Mission Viejo) is to
  Democratic campaigns. (James Minor, recently deceased potato baron of Riverside
  County, contributed to both, and showed special interest in electing the County
  Sheriff.)<br>
  <br>
  All holders have devoted major efforts to contesting their property tax assessments.
  Property taxes on undeveloped land drain cash from an owner, getting his attention,
  and are for many owners their primary
  motive to dispose of surplus land. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Until quite recently
  the Irvine
  policy was never to sell, only to lease land.</span> Confrontations with lessees
  over escalating ground rents have been highly visible, and probably contributed
  to the recent Assessor's decision to upvalue the assessment considerably in excess
  of Bren's 1983 purchase price [L.A. Times, 1/29/84]. The Assessor has an unlikely
  ally also in Joan Irvine, who claims her shares have been undervalued in various
  settlements. Bren took the Assessor to court, but the resulting figure was nearer
  the Assessor's than Bren's.<br>
  <br>
  Bren is not accelerating development and sales. In 1988 he cut the staff by 20%.
  The policy is to skim the cream of the market, but very slowly, by limiting development
  to highest quality. California's Proposition 13 of 1978, capping property taxes
  at 1% of market value, keeps the burden low and tolerable when prices are rising
  at 20% a year.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rancho Mission Viejo</span> is second in size
  at 38,000 acres. It is held by Richard O'Neill and his sister, Alice O'Neill
  Avery, 317th and 318th richest Americans on Forbes' list. Richard O'Neill is
  prominent in California Democratic Party politics. Irvine and O'Neill representatives
  are from time to time on various citizens' advisory committees to the NAGS campus
  at UCR.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mission Viejo Company</span>, with 9,100
  acres, comes in third. It is held by Philip Reilly. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">read the whole article</a><br>
