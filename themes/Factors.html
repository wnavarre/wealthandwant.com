    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Suppose there should arise from the
        English Channel or the German Ocean a no man's land on which common labor
        to an unlimited amount should
            be able to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated
            and of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large
        a part of English soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon
            increase to thirty shillings a day.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on
            rents?&quot; he would at a moment's reflection say that rents must
            necessarily fall; and if he thought out the next step he would tell
            you that all this
            would happen without any very large part of English labor being diverted
            to the new natural opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry
            being much changed; only that kind of production being abandoned
            which now yields to labor and to landlord together less than labor
            could secure
            on the new opportunities. The great rise in wages would be at the
            expense of rent.</div>

        <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man,
              who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here
              is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in
              ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach,
              the electric
              light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and
              improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of
              labor. Will, in

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be

        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of
          common labor will not be any higher; on the contrary, all the chances
          are that they will be lower; it
              will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent

          the Object &#8212; Taxation the Means</a> (1890)            </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, look at it here today, in
      this new country, where there are
      as yet only 65 millions of us scattered over a territory that in the
      present stage of the arts is sufficient to support in comfort a
      thousand millions; yet we are actually thinking and talking as if
      there were too many people in the country. We want more wealth. Why
      don't we get it? Is any factor of production short? What are the
      factors of production? Labour, capital, and land; but to put them in
      the order of their importance: land, labour, capital. We want more
      wealth; what is the difficulty? Is it in labour; is there not enough
      labour? No. From all parts of the United States we hear of what seems
      like a surplus of labour. We have actually got to thinking that the
      man who gives another employment is giving him a boon. Is there any
      scarcity of capital? Why, so abundant is capital today that United
      States bonds, bought at the current rate, will only yield a fraction
      over 2% per annum. So abundant is capital that there can be no doubt
      that a government loan could be floated today at 2% and little doubt
      but that it would soon command a premium. So abundant is capital that
      all over the country it is pressing for remunerative employment. </small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the limitation is not in
      labour and not in capital, it must be
      in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
      Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
      even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
      Francisco? Go to that great city of New York, where people are
      crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
      physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
      Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
      gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
      houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
      crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
      on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. Yet, why are there
      not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
      build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
      which to build more houses. </small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Today one half of the area of
              New York City is unbuilt
      upon &#8212; is absolutely unused. When there is such a pressure, why
      don't people go to these vacant lots and build there? Because though
      unused, the land is owned; because, speculating upon the future
      growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
      of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.
      What you see in New York, you may see everywhere. Come into the
      coalfields of Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands
      and thousands of miners unable to work, either locked out by their
      employers, or striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages
      being cut down a little more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

          <blockquote>
            <p>At this point we find all essential differences distinguished.
              Every factor of industry and every material object of desire that
              can be imagined falls into one or another of the four classes of
              the chart. 48 And from mere inspection of the chart we may see,
              what was promised when we began its construction, that in searching
              for the source of one of the objects that satisfy human wants we
              have discovered the source of all. For it is self-evident that
              the material wants of men are satisfied in no other way than by
              the consumption of finished artificial objects, technically called
              Wealth; and the chart shows that such objects have their source
              in a combination of the three &quot;factors,&quot; namely: (1)
              the activities of man, technically termed &quot;Labor;&quot; (2)
              natural objects external to man, technically termed Land; and (3)
            unfinished artificial objects, technically termed Capital.</p>
            <p>48. For example: Flour, which is unfinished bread, and therefore
              unfinished wealth &#8212; Capital, appears upon analysis to be
              a compound of grain, a mill site, and a miller. The mill site and
              the miller are respectively land and labor; but the grain and the
              mill are unfinished wealth &#8212; Capital, and may be further
              analyzed. Passing the mill for the moment to analyze the grain,
              we find it composed of a farmer, a farm site, and farming improvements
              and implements. The farm site, like the mill site, is land; and
              the farmer, like the miller, is labor; but the improvements and
              implements, like the mill and the grain, are unfinished wealth &#8212; Capital,
              and may be still further analyzed. And so on.</p>
            <p>If analyzed to the last, every constituent of bread, and every
              constituent of that constituent, would resolve into labor and land.
              To follow them step by step would be tedious work and require much
              special knowledge. It would involve consideration of factories
              and factory sites, stores and store sites, railroads and railroad
              sites, mining and mines, lumbering and forests, rivers, docks,
              oceans, and ships. But analysis in full detail is not necessary.
              The conclusion is self-evident the moment it is understood.</p>
            <p>But while these three factors combined produce all the material
              objects that tend to satisfy human wants, they do not constitute
              the ultimate source of those objects. Our analysis is not yet ended;
              our chart is still incomplete.</p>
            <p>Reflection assures us that all artificial objects, finished and
              unfinished, resolve upon final analysis into the two factors, the
              activities of man and natural external objects; or, in technical
              language, all Wealth, finished and unfinished, resolves upon final
              analysis into Labor and Land. Therefore, Capital is in final analysis
              eliminated as a factor of production. It expresses nothing which
              the two remaining factors do not imply; for it is by the conjunction
              of those two factors that Capital itself is produced. 49 Unfinished
              artificial objects and their technical term, Capital, should, therefore,
              be erased from the chart. Following is the result: ...</p>
            <p>This is the final analysis. In the union of Labor, which includes
              all human effort,52 with Land, which includes the whole material
              universe outside of man,53 we discover the ultimate source of Wealth,
              which includes all the material things that satisfy want.54 And
              that is the first great truth upon which the single tax philosophy
              is built.</p>

      <small>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the public

    Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
    Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
      In a
      market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
      four factors of production: </small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
        <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
        <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
        <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
      investments and organizing production). </small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
      must
      either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
      entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
      that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
      <p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
      so at
      the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
      to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
      that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
      reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
      springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
      Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
      attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
      city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
      entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
      that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
      interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
      market forces.</small></p>
      <p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
      earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
      away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
      interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
      have the option of moving away. </small></p>
      <p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
      rent
      of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
      sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
      opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
      for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
      <p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
      revenue
      to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
      entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
      collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
      <p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
      urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
      rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
      and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
      <small><strong>... </strong>Every activity that is
      continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
      Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
      rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
      pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
      </small>
      <p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
      financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
      <p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
      public
      revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
      equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
      on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
      
</small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
      of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
      of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
      of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
      be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
      than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
      it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
      spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
      rental value of land comes from the provision
      of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
      services
      can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
      results from their activities.</small></li>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
      rental value of any particular site arises
      from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
      site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
      land is
      particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
      private activities according to how much they increase the rental
      value of land.</small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
      land
      has two parts. </small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
      of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
      does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
      according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
      and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
      on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
      invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
      investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
      when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
      amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
      Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
      productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
      revenue do.</small></li>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
      efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
      to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
      not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
      ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
      use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
      are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
      rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
      ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
      someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
      land,
      it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
      just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
      The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
      that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
      should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
      can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
      their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
      <p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
      privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
      according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
      it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
      passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
      <p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
      generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
      And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
      land.</small></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
      efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
      finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
      revenue as well:</small></p>
      <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
      as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
      radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
        <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
      payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
      revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
      pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
      estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
      on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
      cost.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
      value of surrounding land.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
      crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
      others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
      is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
      handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
      that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
      which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
      electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
      make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
      is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
      he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
      increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
      covered by user charges.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
      at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
      tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
      to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
      pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
      may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
      it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
      identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
      purposes.</small></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
      of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
      collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
      excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
      basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
      finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
      additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
      all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
      paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
      tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
      disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
      most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
      <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
      the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
      moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
      of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
      corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
      higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
      higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
      complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
      to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
      partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
      provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
      receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
      for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
      investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
      a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
      change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
      all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
      corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
      either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
      be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
      Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
      attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
      government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
      collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
      <p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
      features. 
      </small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
      that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
      competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
      of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
      this feature. <br>
          </small></li>
        <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
      is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
      person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
      pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
      surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
      other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
      publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
      reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
      development. 
          </small></li>
      </ul>
      <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
      attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
      raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
      its land.</small> ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

    Kris Feder: <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html">Progress and Poverty
    Today </a><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists will recognize his
      analysis as a precursor to the
      modern marginal productivity theory of functional distribution. His
      story is framed in the language of what is today called classical
      political economy, though George was careful to avoid inconsistencies
      of definition and reasoning which, he showed, had led other
      economists astray.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central feature of the British
      classical school was the
      classification of productive resources into three "factors of
      production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
      conceived of these in terms of three great social classes (the
      workers, the landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the
      other hand, identified them as functional categories, distinguished
      by the conditions under which the factors are made available for
      production.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
      earnings of the factors of
      production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
      product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
      land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
      terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
      persistently low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of
      increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
      give but a bare living?"</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds
      systematically. First, George explores the
      prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
      principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
      combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
      Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
      depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
      An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
      per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
      subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
      children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
      therefore, wages - to recede again.</small> ... <a

    <small>    </small> A.J.O. [probably Mark Twain]: <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      Suppose I am the owner of an estate and 100 slaves, all the land
      about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
      myself.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <small>
      Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
      unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
      free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <small>
      Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
      work it for themselves, and be their own masters.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <small> "But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your
      proposals
      about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
      but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
      give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
      reasonable, would it?"&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <small>
      Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
      as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
      agree."&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <small>
      So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
      old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
      whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
      from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
      of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
      themselves. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep my
      men in brutish ignorance, I
      find public schools established at other people's expense to
      stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
      advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
      service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
      is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
      in many ways.</small></p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <small>REJOICE! I AM CAPITAL AND I
      EMPLOY PEOPLE!</small>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
      pecuniary benefit. I have lost
      the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
      character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
      benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
      country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
      say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
      capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
      far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
      for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
      them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
      country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <small>
      But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an overseer
      to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
      doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
      called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
      for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
      yearly pay.&nbsp; <strong>.... </strong></small><br>
      <small>
      For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
      equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
      toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
      for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
      and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
      no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
      debts. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
      I that do it; it is that greedy
      and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
      and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
      considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
      not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">I only want my rent --
      and
      get it. </span><b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither
      do I
      spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
      comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
      privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
      comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
      indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
      is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
      would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      This sketch illustrates the fact that chattel slavery is not the
      only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
      pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
      economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
      the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
      in the USA, the UK and Australia
      understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
      filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
      on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
      been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of
      privilege and power &#8212; captives of the current hegemony &#8212;

      Beneath all ideologies, there are basic factors and relationships that
      underlie economic behavior. To understand the (otherwise inexplicable)
      omission of attention to land's economic importance, it is useful to go
      back to these basics.</small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The term "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land</span>" refers to the whole
      material universe, exclusive of people and their products. </span>Not
      the creation of human labor, yet essential to labor, it is the raw
      material from which all wealth is fashioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It includes not only soil and minerals, but
      water, air, natural vegetation and wildlife, and all natural
      opportunities -- even those yet to be discovered.</span> It is a
      passive factor of production, yielding wealth only when labor is
      applied to it.</small></li>
        <li><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Labor </span>includes
      all human powers, mental and physical, used
      directly or indirectly to produce goods or to render service in
      exchange. Labor is often thought of as work that is done for hire, at
      fixed wages, mainly excluded from the risk-taking and decision-making
      that is normally classed under the heading of "entrepreneurship". Yet
      labor, properly understood, includes all human exertion in production
      -- including mental exertion. The payment to labor is called <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Wages</span>. And
      it is important to remember that the payment, or return, to labor does
      not include any returns that are the result of monopoly.</small></li>
        <li><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Capital </span>is
      the economic term that is most profoundly misunderstood
      and confused. For the term to make sense in any systematic analysis of
      wealth distribution, we must define capital in its classical sense as
"wealth which is used to aid in further production, instead of being
      directly consumed." Since production is not completed until the product
      is in the hands of the consumer, products on their way to market, or
"wealth in the course of exchange," are also considered capital.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now,
      the objective of all economic
      behavior is the satisfaction of human desires. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Human beings always seek to
      satisfy their desires with the least exertion</span>: this self-evident
      proposition lies at the heart of our concepts of economic value and
      exchange. </span>The primary thing needed for satisfaction is, of
      course, the tangible things, made from natural resources, that satisfy
      human desires and have exchange value. Things that meet these four
      fundamental criteria are termed "wealth". But money, bonds, and
      mortgages are but claims upon and measures of this value; they are not
      the wealth they symbolize.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>A clear understanding of these basic definitions points
      immediately to
      the primacy of land as an economic factor. Human beings have
      inescapable material needs of food, clothing and shelter. Regardless of
      how long a chain of exchanges they may pass through in a modern
      economy, these things ultimately have their source in the land; they
      can come from nowhere else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Human
      beings need land in order to live. But if we must pay rent to a private
      land "owner" for access to the gifts of nature, it amounts to being
      charged a fee for our very right to live.</span>&nbsp; <a

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
      classical economic thought still
      regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
      From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
      with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a
      function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John
      Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve optimal economic
      productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from each of
      those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of capital
      was interest; and the price of land, particularly following the
      thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. Rent in its classical sense
      means payment for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more
      generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
      Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted
      if the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we
      shall see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not
      seeing any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent
      economics profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to
      regard land as a separate factor and to redefine the terms of
      production instead in two- factor theory. This was concurrent with
      the inclusion of land as property, since called "real property." ... <a

      <p>THE term labor includes all human exertion in the production of wealth,
        and wages, being that part of the produce which goes to labor, includes
        all reward for such exertion. There is, therefore, in the politico-economic
        sense of the term wages no distinction as to the kind of labor, or as
        to whether its reward is received through an employer or not, but wages
        means the return received for the exertion of labor, as distinguished
        from the return received for the use of capital, and the return received
        by the landholder for the use of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book
        I, Chapter 2: Wages and Capital: The Meaning of the Terms</a><br>
          <br>
I AM aware that the theorem that wages are drawn from capital is one of the most
fundamental and apparently best settled of current political economy, and that
it has been accepted as axiomatic by all the great thinkers who have devoted
their powers to the elucidation of the science. Nevertheless, I think it can
be demonstrated to be a fundamental error &#8212; the fruitful parent of a long
series of errors, which vitiate most important practical conclusions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book
I, Chapter 3: Wages and Capital: Wages not drawn from capital, but produced by
the labor</a><br>
          <br>
THE fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly grasped
and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed form is but an
elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and that principles obvious
in the simpler relations of men are merely disguised and not abrogated or reversed
by the more intricate relations that result from the division of labor and the
use of complex tools and methods. . . . And so, if we reduce to their lowest
terms all the complex operations of modern production, we see that each individual
who takes part in this infinitely subdivided and intricate network of production
and exchange is really doing what the primeval man did when he climbed the trees
for fruit or followed the receding tide for shellfish &#8212; endeavoring to
obtain from nature by the exertion of his powers the satisfaction of his desires.
If we keep this firmly in mind, if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as
the co-operation of all embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various
desires of each, we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions
comes as truly and as directly from nature as the result of that exertion, as
did that of the first man. <br>
          <br>
To illustrate: In the simplest state of which we can conceive, each man digs
his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantage of the division of labor
soon becomes apparent, and one digs bait while the others fish. Yet evidently
the one who digs bait is in reality doing as much toward the catching of fish
as any of those who actually take the fish. So when the advantages of canoes
are discovered, and instead of all going a-fishing, one stays behind and makes
and repairs canoes, the canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor to the taking
of fish as much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he eats at night
when the fishermen come home, are as truly the product of his labor as of theirs.
And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated, and instead of each
attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct resort to nature, one fishes,
another hunts, a third picks berries, a fourth gathers fruit, a fifth makes tools,
a sixth builds huts, and a seventh prepares clothing &#8212; each one is, to
the extent he exchanges the direct product of his own labor for the direct product
of the labor of others, really applying his own labor to the production of the
things he uses &#8212; is in effect satisfying his particular desires by the
exertion of his particular powers; that is to say, what he receives he in reality
produces. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html"> &#8212; Book
