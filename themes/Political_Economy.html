      Increasing Importance of Social Questions </a>(Chapter 1 of <em><a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
      Problems</a></em>, 1883)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[18] The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
      of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
      of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science
      strides forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the
      arts which produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable
      distribution. Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have
      been revolutionized; but whether free trade or protection is best for a
      nation we are not yet agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection
      that, fifty years ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence
      of political corruption, we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River
      bridge is a crowning triumph of mechanical skill; but to get it built a
      leading citizen of Brooklyn had to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars
      in a carpet bag to bribe New York aldermen. The human soul that thought
      out the great bridge is prisoned in a crazed and broken body that lies
      bedfast, and could watch it grow only by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless,
      the weight of the immense mass is estimated and adjusted for every inch.
      But the skill of the engineer could not prevent condemned wire being smuggled
      into the cable.</p>
    <p>[19] The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
      be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few,
      but that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or
      political economy to college professors. The people themselves must think,
      because the people alone can act.</p>
    <p>[21] The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not
      a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
      and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond
      self-interest, whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many.
      It must seek justice. For at the bottom of every social problem we will
      find a social wrong. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We see in these social and

      <div style="text-align: right;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social, and political
            difficulties that perplex the world, and with which statesmanship and philanthropy

        <div style="text-align: left;">It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization, and
            which not to answer is to be destroyed.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><B>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but
        to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast
        between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and
        cannot be permanent.</B> The reaction must come. The tower leans from its
        foundations, and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate
        men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base
        on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions under
        which men are not fully equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every quarter painfully
      upon attention, it has not yet received a solution which accounts for all the
      facts and points to any clear and simple remedy. This is shown by the widely
      varying attempts to account for the prevailing depression. They exhibit not
      merely a divergence between vulgar notions and scientific theories, but also
      show that the concurrence which should exist between those who avow the same
      general theories breaks up upon practical questions into an anarchy of opinion.</div>

      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">are rapidly making way among the great body of the people, who keenly feel
      a hurt and are sharply conscious of a wrong. Such ideas, which bring great
      masses of men, the repositories of ultimate political power, under the leadership
      of charlatans and demagogues, are fraught with danger; but they cannot be successfully
      combated until political economy shall give some answer to the great question
      which shall be consistent with all her teachings, and which shall commend itself
      to the perceptions of the great masses of men.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p><B>It must be within the province of political economy to give such an answer</B>.
        For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of a certain
        set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of certain phenomena,
        seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the
        physical sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations
        upon firm ground. <B>The premises from which it makes its deductions are truths
        which have the highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which
        we safely base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
        reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion seeks
        the line of least resistance--<I>viz</I>., </B><FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><B><I>that
        men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion</I></B></FONT><B>.</B> Proceeding
        from a basis thus assured, its processes, which consist simply in identification
        and separation, have the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science
        as geometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its conclusions
        by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should be as self-apparent.
        And although in the domain of political economy we cannot test our theories
        by artificially produced combinations or conditions, as may be done in some
        of the other sciences, yet we can apply tests no less conclusive, by comparing
        societies in which different conditions exist, or by, in imagination, separating,
        combining, adding or eliminating forces or factors of known direction.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of political
      economy the great problem I have outlined. <B>I propose to seek the law which
      associates poverty with progress, and increases want with advancing wealth;
      and I believe that in the explanation of this paradox we shall find the explanation
      of those recurring seasons of industrial and commercial paralysis which, viewed
      independent of their relations to more general phenomena, seem so inexplicable.</B> Properly
      commenced and carefully pursued, such an investigation must yield a conclusion
      that will stand every test, and as truth will correlate with all other truth.
      For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause,
      and every fact implies a preceding fact.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">That political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the persistence
      of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which accords with the deep-seated

        <div style="text-align: left;">that, on the contrary, after a century of cultivation, during which it
            has engrossed the attention some of the most subtle and powerful intellects,

            the opinion of many educated and thinking men to the rank of a pseudo-science
            in which nothing fixed or can be fixed--must, it seems to me, be due not
            to any inability of the science when properly pursued, but some false step
            in its premises, or overlooked factor in its estimates. And as such mistakes
            are generally concealed the respect paid to authority, I propose in this
            inquiry take nothing for granted, but to bring even accepted theories to
            the test of first principles, and should they not stand the test, to freshly
            interrogate facts in the endeavor to discover their law.</div>

I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that honored, not
with the lips but with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion
to worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There
is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad struggle, we trample
in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all; trample it in the
mire while we tear and rend each other. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The

WHOSE fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make that
terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and the necessity
of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that it is the fault
of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring cholera to this country,
or the man who, having the power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort
to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty
kills more people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at the death
statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come quickest; see where it is
that the little children die like flies &#8212; it is in the poorer quarters.
And the man who looks with careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence;
the man who does not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty
of a crime. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime of Poverty</a></em><br>

SOCIAL progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business of each;
it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can escape.
He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes
no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden
underfoot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true Christian. Nor is

THAT thought on social questions is so confused and perplexed, that the aspirations
of great bodies of men, deeply though vaguely conscious of injustice, are in
all civilized countries being diverted to futile and dangerous remedies, is largely
due to the fact that those who assume and are credited with superior knowledge
of social and economic laws have devoted their powers, not to showing where the
injustice lies but to hiding it; not to clearing common thought but to confusing
it. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm">A Perplexed Philosopher</a></em><a href="APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm"> (Conclusion)<br>

POLITICAL economy is the simplest of the sciences. It is but the intellectual
recognition, as related to social life, of laws which in their moral aspect men
instinctively recognize, and which are embodied in the simple teachings of him
whom the common people heard gladly. But, like Christianity, political economy
has been warped by institutions which, denying the equality and brotherhood of
man, have enlisted authority, silenced objection, and ingrained themselves in
custom and habit of thought. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter

          <p>HE term Land in political economy means the natural or passive element
            in production, and includes the whole external world accessible to
            man, with all its powers, qualities, and products, except perhaps
            those portions of it which are for the time included in man's body
            or in his products, and which therefore temporarily belong to the
            categories, man and wealth, passing again in their reabsorption by
            nature into the category, land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

THAT land is only a passive factor in production must be carefully kept in mind.
. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who
own land. . . . <br>
  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production
as landowners, and by virtue of that ownership, is as ridiculously impossible
as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

          <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the
            Bay of New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite
            the point where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers,
            board incoming steamers to ask strangers to take their first American
            swear, and where, if false oaths really colored the atmosphere the
            air would be bluer than is the sky on this gracious day. I turn from
            my writing-machine to the window, and drink in, with a pleasure that
            never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

          </span> TAKE now some hard-headed businessman, who has no theories,
          but knows how to make money. Say to him: "Here is a little village;
          in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad
          will have taken the place of the stagecoach, the electric light of
          the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements
          that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in
          ten years, interest be any higher?" <br>
        <br>
He will tell you, "No!" <br>
<br>
"Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a man who
has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?" <br>
        <br>
He will tell you, "No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher; on the
contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not be easier
for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are that it will
be harder." <br>
        <br>
"What, then, will be higher?" " Rent; the value of land. Go; get yourself a piece
of ground, and hold possession." <br>
        <br>
And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more.
You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni of
Naples or the leperos of Mexico: you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole in
the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota to
the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you
may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an almshouse. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

that is to say, whether our knowledge of the natural economic laws is as yet

THE domain of law is not confined to physical nature. It just as certainly embraces
the mental and moral universe, and social growth and social life have their laws
as fixed as those of matter and of motion. Would we make social life healthy
and happy, we must discover those laws, and seek our ends in accordance with
them. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp22.html">Social

22: Conclusion</a></p>
          <p>POLITICAL economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of a certain
  set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of certain phenomena,
  seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the
  physical sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations
  upon firm ground. The premises from which it makes its deductions are truths
  which have the highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which
  we safely base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
  reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion seeks
  the line of least resistance &#8212; viz. that men seek to gratify their desires
  with the least exertion. Proceeding from a basis thus assured, its processes,
  which consist simply in identification, and separation, have the same certainty.
  In this sense it is as exact a science as geometry, which, from similar truths
  relative to space, obtains its conclusions by similar means, and its conclusions
  when valid should be as self-apparent. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html"> &#8212; Book

WHETHER it proceed from experience of the irksomeness of labor and the desire
to avoid it, or, further back than that, have its source in some innate principle
of the human constitution, this disposition of men to seek the satisfaction of
their desires with the minimum of exertion is so universal and unfailing, that
it constitutes one of those invariable sequences that we denominate laws of nature,
and from which we may safely reason. It is this law of nature that is the fundamental
law of political economy &#8212; the central law from which its deductions and
explanations may with certainty be drawn, and, indeed, by which alone they become
possible. It holds the same place in the sphere of political economy that the
law of gravitation does in physics. Without it there could be no recognition
of order, and all would be chaos. . . . It is no more affected by the selfishness
or unselfishness of our desires than is the law of gravitation. It is simply
a fact. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212;<a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe112.html"> unabridged:

          </a>IN the economic meaning of the term production, the transporter
          or exchanger, or anyone engaged in any subdivision of those functions,
          is as truly engaged in production as is the primary extractor or maker.
          A newspaper-carrier or the keeper of a news-stand would, for instance,
          in common speech be styled a distributor. But in economic terminology
          he is not a distributor of wealth, but a producer of wealth. Although
          his part in the process of producing the newspaper to the final receiver
          comes last, not first, he is as much a producer as the paper-maker
          or type-founder, the editor, or compositor, or press-man. For the object
          of production is the satisfaction of human desires, that is to say,
          it is consumption; and this object is not made capable of attainment,
          that is to say, production is not really complete, until wealth is
          brought to the place where it is to be consumed and put at the disposal
          of him whose desire it is to satisfy.&nbsp; &#8212; <em>The Science

PRODUCTION and distribution are not separate things, but two mentally distinguishable
parts of one thing &#8212; the exertion of human labor in the satisfaction of
human desire. Though materially distinguishable, they are as closely related
as the two arms of the syphon. And as it is the outflow of water at the longer
end of the syphon that is the cause of the inflow of water at the shorter end,
so it is that distribution is really the cause of production, not production
the cause of distribution. In the ordinary course, things are not distributed
because they have been produced, but are produced in order that they may be distributed.
Thus interference with the distribution of wealth is interference with the production
of wealth, and shows its effect in lessened production. &#8212; <em>The Science

OUR inquiry into the laws of the distribution of wealth is not an inquiry into
the municipal laws or human enactments which either here and now, or in any other
time and place, prescribe or have prescribed how wealth shall be divided among
men. With them we have no concern, unless it may be for purposes of illustration.
What we have to seek are those laws of the distribution of wealth which belong
to the natural order &#8212; laws which are a part of that system or arrangement
which constitutes the social organism or body economic, as distinguished from
the body politic or state, the Greater Leviathan which makes its appearance with
civilization and develops with its advance. These natural laws are in all times
and places the same, and though they may be crossed by human enactment, can never
be annulled or swerved by it. It is more needful to call this to mind, because,
in what have passed for systematic treatises on political economy, the fact that
it is with natural laws, not human laws, that the science of political economy
is concerned, has, in treating of the distribution of wealth, been utterly ignored,
and even flatly denied. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe401.html">unabridged:

THE distinction between the laws of production and the laws of distribution is
not, as is erroneously taught in the scholastic political economy, that the one
set of laws are natural laws and the other human laws. Both sets of laws are
laws of nature. The real distinction is that the natural laws of pro<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>duction
are physical laws and the natural laws of distribution are moral laws. . . .
The moment we turn from a consideration of the laws of the production of wealth
to a consideration of the laws of the distribution of wealth, the idea of ought
or duty becomes primary. All consideration of distribution involves the ethical
principle, is necessarily a consideration of ought or duty &#8212; a consideration
in which the idea of right or justice is from the very first involved. &#8212; <em>The

            <br>
MANY if not most of the writers on political economy have treated exchange as
a part of distribution. On the contrary, it belongs to production. It is by exchange,
and through exchange, that man obtains, and is able to exert, the power of co-operation
which, with the advance of civilization, so enormously increases his ability
to produce wealth. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

THEY who, seeing how men are forced by competition to the extreme of human wretchedness,
jump to the conclusion that competition should be abolished, are like those who,
seeing a house burn down, would prohibit the use of fire. <br>
          <br>
The air we breathe exerts upon every square inch of our bodies a pressure of
fifteen pounds. Were this pressure exerted only on one side, it would pin us
to the ground and crush us to a jelly. But being exerted on all sides, we move
under it with perfect freedom. It not only does not inconvenience us, but it
serves such indispensable purposes that, relieved of its pressure, we should
die. <br>
          <br>
So it is with competition. Where there exists a class denied all right to the
element necessary to life arid labor, competition is one-sided, and as population
increases must press the lowest class into virtual slavery, and even starvation.
But where the natural rights of all are secured, then competition, acting on
every hand &#8212; between employers as between employed, between buyers as between
sellers &#8212; can injure no one. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
On the contrary it becomes the most simple, most extensive, most elastic, and
most refined system of co-operation that, in the present stage of social development,
and in the domain where it will freely act, we can rely on for the co-ordination
of industry and the economizing of social forces. <br>
          <br>
In short, competition plays just such a part in the social organism as those
vital impulses which are beneath consciousness do in the bodily organism. With
it, as with them, it is only necessary that it should be free. The line at which
the state should come in is that where free competition becomes impossible &#8212; a
line analogous to that which in the individual organism separates the conscious
from the unconscious functions. There is such a line, though extreme socialists
and extreme individualists both ignore it. The extreme individualist is like
the man who would have his hunger provide him food; the extreme socialist is
like the man who would have his conscious will direct his stomach how to digest
it. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, chapter 28 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT28.html#Chapter%2028">econlib</a></p>

          <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to
            the form that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural
            purposes is integral to the production of the means of our subsistence.
            Its use in an urban context is crucial in shaping how effectively
            cities function and who gets the principal benefits from urban economic
            growth. Its ownership is a major determinant of the degree of economic
            inequality: surges of land prices, such as have occurred in Australian
            cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions of wealth.
            In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and nature

          <p><strong>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political
            economic analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis
            of land was central in an earlier era of political economic analysis.</strong>            The role of land in relation to economic production, income distribution
            and economic growth was a major concern for <strong>classical political
            economists</strong>,
            such as Smith, Ricardo and Malthus. But the intervening years have
            seen land slide into a more peripheral status within economic analysis.
            Political economists working in the Marxian tradition have tended
            to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as the key to understanding
            the capitalist economy.1<strong> Neo-classical economists</strong> typically treat
            land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of production&#8217; equivalent
            to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its distinctive features
            and differences. <strong>Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists </strong>have also
            given little attention to land because typically their analyses focus
            more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.</p>
          <p>However, there is an alternative current of political economic thought
            for which &#8216;the land question&#8217; is central. This is the
            tradition based on the ideas of Henry George. This article seeks
            a balanced assessment of the usefulness of George&#8217;s ideas in
            the modern context. It outlines how insights derived from Georgist
            thinking can help in dealing with contemporary economic, social and
            environmental problems, while noting deficiencies and additional
            concerns. Following a general summary of Georgist ideas and policy
            proposals, six themes are addressed:</p>

                  <p><strong>The Moral Issue</strong></p>
                  <p>Georgism has a distinctive ethical basis. So a review of
                    the contemporary relevance of Georgist political economy
                    can usefully begin by making this explicit. The key moral
                    issue is the private appropriation of public wealth. As George
                    recognised, land is a &#8216;gift from nature&#8217; and,
                    as such, is rightfully a community resource. Hence, those
                    deriving benefits from the private ownership of land should
                    recompense the community for the privilege. This principle
                    has strong echoes of the idea of &#8216;usufruct&#8217;,
                    a pre-capitalist term denoting a person&#8217;s legal right
                    to use and accrue benefits from property that does not belong
                    to them. In return, the user is obliged to keep the property
                    in good repair and pay all costs as a &#8216;ground rent&#8217; (&#8216;Lectric
                    Law Library, n.d). The concept of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; has
                    fallen out of common usage, so one hesitates to try to revive
                    it. Moreover, as Richards (2002) notes, &#8216;it is difficult
                    to image how this word could be employed, or brought back
                    into circulation, in the modern world, since we live in a
                    world in which people tend to be remarkably unsympathetic
                    to the property rights or claims of others&#8217;.</p>
                  <p>However, the principle of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; goes to
                    the heart of the question of how best to balance collective
                    and individual rights and interests. George&#8217;s solution
                    of a tax on the value of land squarely addresses this issue.
                    By returning a proportion of the land value to the community
                    in the form of taxation revenue, restitution would be paid
                    for the use of a community resource. This is an ethical justification
                    for land taxation. </p>
                  <p>                    Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is
                    a misnomer because what is really involved is value created
                    by the community being retained by the community rather than
                    being appropriated by private landholders. For example, under
                    current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
                    when the market value of their land rises as a result of
                    publicly provided infrastructure being built nearby, or when
                    local government zoning decisions reclassify their land as
                    appropriate for further development. In this way, individual
                    landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of
                    community-generated processes. Such arrangements create an
                    odd incentive: allowing landholders to appropriate the unearned
                    wealth generated by rising land values, thereby rewarding
                    this unproductive activity, while taxing productive endeavour.
                    The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast,
                    would eliminate such perverse incentives and thereby more
                    effectively align private and public interests in the use
                  of society&#8217;s resources.</p>
                  <p>However, the Georgist position cannot claim to provide a
                    fully comprehensive solution to the moral issue of balancing
                    individual and collective rights. While land tax addresses
                    the private appropriation of wealth from land, it does not
                    address the appropriation of wealth from other sources. The
                    characteristically Georgist focus on land as the source of
                    the maldistribution of wealth is limiting in this respect.
                    Political economists have long argued that the accumulation
                    of capital also arises from the exploitation of labour, for
                    example. Whether the exploitation of labour is systemic,
                    as Marx argued, or exceptional is properly a matter of debate.
                    Either way, the point is that an ethical basis for the economic
                    system, and for the tax system in particular, needs to take
                    account of both land-related and other sources of unjustifiable
                    wealth appropriation. The moral issue thereby links with
                    a second concern of more explicitly economic character &#8211; the
                    sources of inequality in the distribution of wealth.</p>
                  <p>Wealth Inequality</p>
                  <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a
                    principal source of inequality. Because land is a strictly
                    limited resource, its private ownership necessarily excludes
                    large sections of the community from its benefits. A landowning
                    class thereby gains political economic power. In George&#8217;s
                    own time the social identity and power of this landowning
                    class was distinctive. Those who could not afford to buy
                    land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier few who could.
                    By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
                    created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners
                    and redistributed throughout the community more equitably
                  in order to address social goals. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
                  <p>Conclusion</p>
                  <p>Enthusiastic proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas have
                    often presented them as a panacea for the economic, social
                    and environmental problems that beset contemporary society.
                    Indeed, the Georgist analysis does have much to offer. By
                    more adequately addressing land as a unique economic, social
                    and ecological resource, it can help to reveal underlying
                    causes of currently pressing issues such as declining housing
                    affordability, growing economic inequality, and environmental
                    decay.</p>
                  <p>The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217; can also play
                    an important role in the redress of these problems. However,
                    there are limitations to the modern application of George&#8217;s
                    ideas, as outlined in this article. While a uniform land
                    tax is a necessary component in addressing contemporary political
                    economic problems, it is not sufficient. It needs to be set
                    in the context of a broader political economic analysis and
                    policy program, also addressing public housing, urban and
                    regional policies, environmental taxes and regulations, &#8216;floors
                    and ceilings&#8217; to limit income inequalities and macroeconomic
                    stabilisation.</p>
                  <p>While the Georgist analysis redresses the general neglect
                    of land in modern economic orthodoxy, it is important not
                    to go too far to the other extreme. In other words, the important
                    emphasis on land should not come at the expense of attention
                    to problems associated with labour and capital and to the
                    complex forms of government policy necessary for the balancing
                    of contemporary economic, social and ecological concerns.
                    The Georgist analysis needs to be integrated into a comprehensive
                    political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism.</p>
                  <p>So what does &#8216;putting Henry George in his place&#8217; entail?
                    It means recognising the political economic importance of
                    land and the potential social gains from the extension of
                    land taxation. Equally, it means recognising the necessity
                    of relating Georgist ideas and policy prescriptions to a
                    broader canvas of modern political economy, including the
                    analytical traditions associated with Karl Marx, J. M. Keynes,
                    and J. K. Galbraith, and modern environmental economics.
                    Henry George&#8217;s place is in good company. <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read

        </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
        that
        death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
        than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
        and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
      all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
      <p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
        commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
        and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
        commandment is that we love our neighbor as
        ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
        asked who our
        neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
        implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
        <font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
        ethic in which
        there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
      </span></span></small></p>
      <p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
        against
        me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
        unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
        other words, we are to
      forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
      <p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
        need to
        survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
        our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
      survive: <strong>... </strong></small></p>
      <p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
        material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
        the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
      fishes.</small></p>
      <p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
        scarcity
        is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
        Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
        <font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
      </i></b></small></font></small></p>
      <p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
        construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
        economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
        there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
      efforts.</small></p>
      <p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
        expected
        to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
        hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
        parable is
        followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
        of what constitutes accomplishment:
      <font size="-1"><small><b><i>...</i></b></small></font></small></p>
      <p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
      anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
      <small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
        will
        ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
        required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
        be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
        against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
      not be judged:&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <small></small>
      <p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
        problem
        of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
        the organization of the production of goods and their
      distribution.</small></p>
      <p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
        concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
        is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
        are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
        production, without being anxious about our own material
        requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
        so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
        satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
        conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
      provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
      <p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
        and
        markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
        them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
        us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
      us. <strong>... </strong></small>  <small></small></p>
      <p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
        political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
        use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
        the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
        refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
        otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
        participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
        capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
      ourselves.</small></p>
      <p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
        questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
        price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
        opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
        agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
        to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
        the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
        than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
      pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
      <small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
        prescribe
        its terms is supported by a passage from
      Luke:<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <small></small><br>
      <small>Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
      relations between traders. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <small>The problem of worker management is not a problem either. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <small></small>
      <p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
        Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
        permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
        firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
        are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
        leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
        for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
        ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
        in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
        our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
        from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
      </small></p>
      <p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
        whether
        capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
        economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
        Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
        under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
        should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
        we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
        different principles of political economy have their share of land
      and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
      <p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
        economy
        based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
        in love; but perfect love casteth out
        fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
        construct a
        political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
        fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
        contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
        who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
        low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
        something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
        fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
        of the Gospels.</small> <small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html"><span

      Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_landlord.html">For Want
        of a Landlord</a><br>
      <small>In 1620 the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock with its intrepid
        band, and supplies and provisions for the first winter. These
        Pilgrims were of the working poor, ready and able to turn their hands
        to labor. They had carpenters, masons, joiners, bakers, farmers,
        chandlers, boatsmen, fishers, hunters, and other useful types. <strong>...</strong><br>
      </small>
      <p><small>Yet all their hard work and frugality and mutual aid and
        shrewd
        trading availed them nought, God did not prosper their ventures.
        Poverty and distress prevailed; crops withered; timbers rotted;
        stores spoiled; women sued for divorce; discontent ran riot. The
        Elders pondered. As luck would have it, one bachelor had packed along
        a book on Political Economy for the lonely evenings. Studying one
      night he suddenly cried "Eureka! Political Economy will save us!"</small></p>
      <p><small>"What! What could it be?" cried the Elders all together.
"Tell us,
      prithee, before the vision leaveth!"<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a
