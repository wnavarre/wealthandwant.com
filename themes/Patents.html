      <p>Many of the patents in the private sector
        rely on research funded by the public sector, often at our colleges and
        universities.&nbsp; Should all the
          benefits a patent confers go to the private sector, where a relatively small
          fraction
          of the
          public
          owns
          the
          vast majority
          of the corporate shares?&nbsp; Should individuals who need pharmaceuticals
          be forced to pay high prices for them because a single company holds a patent,
          even if much of the underlying research was paid for by the public sector?&nbsp; How
          long should patents last? What is a fair return on individual and corporate
          effort when it is underpinned by publicly-funded research and development?</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Relatedly, it is interesting to consider that one of the sources of population
        growth is the prolonging of peoples' lives through improvements in medicine
        and technology. The presence of more people drives up land value, and, under
        our current system of land monopoly capitalism, helps to line the pockets
        of those who own our best-located land, be they individuals, corporations,
        family trusts or real estate investment trusts. The alternative, of course,
        is to recognize that the economic value of the land belongs to all of us,
        and start collecting it for the commons. </div>

              Wealth Harm America</small></a><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/debate_hyndman_1889.html"><small> (excerpt
    from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp; </small></a><small>(1883)</small>  </small> </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great Wealth</b></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
          recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
          England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate
          than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not
          get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced
          it than did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for
          the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land
          in the early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable.
          His wealth represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of
          this bit of the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings
      of others.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
          leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
          skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
          he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
          a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper
          labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a sixty-per-cent, tariff. To
          the day of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade
          would ruin our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was
          enabled to lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did
          not represent what he had added to production. It was the advantage given
      him by the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
      of wealth."</small>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
          and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to
      account for all great fortunes....</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
          first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved
          it. But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an
          enormous fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
          enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran
          off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he
          went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune
          no more comes from working and saving than did the fortune that Captain
      Kidd buried.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr.
          Gould might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior
          self-denial. But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred
          millions. It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
          getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values
      and transportation rates. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes
          which the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying
          through profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
          of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing
          and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard
          Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer
          Match Ring, and the various rings for the "protection of the American workman
      from the pauper labor of Europe." </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Or take the fortunes made out of successful
          patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
          value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though
          I am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
          in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
      out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </strong></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
          through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed
          fortunes, these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The
          head of one of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said
          to me recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
      it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
      <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
      of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
      monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
      its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
      land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
      city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
      by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
      have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
      labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
      the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
      much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
      and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
      rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
      destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
      public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
      have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
      the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
      that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
      little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
      class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
    of the other. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
          their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
          ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
          of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
          pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
      was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
          by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would
          get a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact
          that it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages
          which we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned
          by law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously
          rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note
          the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building
          up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous
          are those who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations
          and that the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the
          inequalities of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are
          those who talk as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans
          for arbitrarily restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital
          is a good; the capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist.
          We can safely let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil
      others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present
          constitution of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution
          of man nor in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator
          as are the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting
          from bad adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
          state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in
          which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general stock.
          And in such a social state there would not be less incentive to exertion
          than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be more industrious
          and more moral, better workmen and better citizens, if each takes his earnings
          and carries them home to his family, than where they put their earnings
          in a "pot" and gamble for them until some have far more than they could
          have earned, and others have little or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

      Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_GRaCoM.html">Geoism, Recession
          and Control of Monopolies</a>    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>It seems that a great deal of
      anti-trust legislation from the
      Progressive Era had been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had
      started with Thomas A. Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation
      bully as he was a pure inventor. Much of this legislation became
      unravelled under President - guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry,
      and political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and monopolization
      then ran wild. Disney
      under Eisner, of course, has played a role in this. Disney as real
      estate developer throws its heavy weight around brutally.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and
      what it
      would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
      think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
      promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers,
      monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after
      all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive Movements. </small></p>
      <p>      <small>"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform.
        Some
        of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
        of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
        program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
        free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
        and workers.</small><br>
        <small>&nbsp;</small><br>
        <small>Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
        Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
        which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs in
        the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
        which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the
        device of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive
        privilege, it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting
        abuses of power.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
