<blockquote>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We're
        going to look at some
        of our worst social problems and reflect on the extent to which they
        might arise from our economic and social systems.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        <small>Many good, caring parents bring up children who turn out to be a
        real
        mess. There must be something wrong, somewhere, with a society where so
        many people become depressed, cynical, disenchanted, hopeless,
        alienated etc. as to resort to drugs, vandalism, suicide (the
        escalating youth suicide figures are deliberately under-reported) or
        just end up apathetic or anti-social. And it could be argued that
        rampant, mindless and expensive consumerism is a low-intensity but
        widespread indicator of underlying discontent.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT'S MISSING?</span></small><br>
        <small>One can see some pretty obvious causes, but it still doesn't add
        up.
        Institutionalised religions (or, at least, its purveyors) have clearly
        failed to supply an adequate explanation of our current dilemma, let
        alone offer just solutions, as people continue to turn away from it in
        droves. Our cynicism of politicians is somewhat justified, as even a
        few of the best seem to sell out once they get into power. The
        bombardment of advertising and trash culture, with all its emphasis on
        glamour and image, must screw up a lot of impressionable kids. I like
        the graffiti sprayed on a Melbourne wall stating: " Obedient sheep love
        to shop".</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>No, it still doesn't add up, but here's a partial explanation
        why. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All
        the aforementioned problems take place in an economic environment which
        simply is not and cannot be understood, and for that reason can never
        be respected. In particular, taxation - which hits us in the hip pocket
        more than anything else - springs from a mass of legislation completely
        beyond the capacity of any individual to understand.</span> In
        addition,
        there's disrespect for our tax (and governance) system because there's
        no clear rationale or validation for its principles. Compared to the
        elegant beauty of Pay for what you take, not what you make, the present
        tax system is seen as a necessary nuisance at best, but more commonly
        as an arbitrary means of milking us. Furthermore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the economic and tax
        systems make cynics and cheats of us all.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Cynics - the
        wage-earning
        workforce, both blue and white collar - stand in disgust as they
        witness the rich getting richer as they confiscate the economic rent.
        </span>Cheats, because everyone else is a cheat when it comes to
        filling tax
        returns, so why should I be a mug and be honest?</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE INVESTMENT SHOULD GO</span></small><br>
        <small>Lastly, social alienation is partly a result of an economic
        system that
        cannot afford to invest in community-building amenities and
        infrastructure. We have seen how such spending effectively disappears
        into the black hole of landowners' pockets instead of being recycled
        back to the community through LVT, and we have also imagined A Day in
        the Life which illustrates what affordable community amenities could
        bring people together. But the whole area of the personal and social
        benefits conferred by a stronger community network is a vast and
        debatable subject in itself, and is beyond the basics of Geonomics in
        these kits.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

      Is There a Conspiracy in the Teaching of Economics and History
      within the American Education System?</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="font-style: italic;"><small><b>TPR</b> - If Earth's ecosystem
    and
    poorest people will
    be the largest beneficiaries of the reform you advocate, how will it
    ever gain public acceptance in America's increasingly money-driven
    political system? If the press will never acknowledge it and the
    education system is so lost and blind, how can this reform ever
    happen? Are Georgists like the character in 1984?</small></p>
  <p><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Every system must purify itself from time
    to
    time, or be destroyed. How long that takes depends on how strong a
    base you started from, and how strong your rivals are. The USA
    started from a strong base, built in part by the Progressives
    (including many Georgists) and the New Dealers (in spite of some of
    their destructive moves). Now, our leaders think we are riding high,
    just because the stock market is rising, even though real wage rates
    have fallen for 25 years, our debts are staggering, our liabilities
    and contingent liabilities exceed our assets, our biggest growth
    industry is building jails, our population is losing its literacy,
    our major cities have decayed, and so on. Marx was right about one
    thing, at least: the system carries the seeds of its own
    destruction.</small></p>
  <p><small>Our leaders have done a good job of subverting our rivals, in
    part
    by forcing on them the ideas of neo-classical economics, the ideas
    that originated as part of the anti-Georgist campaigns. Japan gave us
    a good run for a while, but got suckered into aping our worst habits,
    and hence a good old-fashioned American-style land boom and bust that
    has knocked them out of the race for a while. Most of S.E. Asia has
    now followed suit.</small></p>
  <p><small>It's a delicate balance. The haves can brainwash the
    have-nots
    just so long, until reality breaks through, as in 1929. When it does,
    you want to be ready with a plan tailored to the times, which
    Georgists at that time were not. Meantime, we keep the idea alive by
    recording and publicizing important facts, such as that the
    prosperity of Hong Kong was a product of Georgist policies; likewise
    that of Taipei, Sydney, Johannesburg, and other great cities. </small></p>
  <ul>
    <li><small>We support object lessons like those in Allentown, Pa.,
      and go
      for a really visible one like Philadelphia. </small></li>
    <li><small>We combat moves to raise sales and income and payroll
      taxes, and
      awaken people to the benefits of lowering them. </small></li>
    <li><small>We awaken people to the possibilities of including more
      land
      income, and less payroll income, in the base of the income tax. </small></li>
    <li><small>We support efforts to democratize the media. </small></li>
    <li><small>We alert people to the corruption of academia and the kept
      think-tanks, and provide alternative venues by mobilizing the resources
      of the few Georgist-oriented foundations. </small></li>
    <li><small>We get on social action committees of various churches,
      and try
      to give their well-meant but often foggy-minded efforts some clearer
      focus, with more punch and less platitude. </small></li>
    <li><small>We remind people of their common rights, and the history
      of
      common property in land. </small></li>
    <li><small>We expose and ridicule the inconsistencies and hypocrisies
      of
      kept economists, hoping that embarrassment will convert those whom
      truth will not.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <p><small>We avoid the temptation to play Jeremiah, but seek to join
    the
    system and make it work better, even as Henry George and his friends
    did.&nbsp; ... <a

  <p>... Our problem today, as yesterday, and the days before, back to the earliest
      recorded times, is POVERTY.</p>
  <p>There are times when this problem is lesser. We call these "booms." There
      are also times when the problem is greatly exacerbated. These are called "busts." But,
      as the Bible says, "the poor have ye always with ye."</p>
  <p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the core of the problem. It is not
      the position that there is only one single error afoot in our social organizations.
      There may be several, there may be only a few things to remedy. The position
      is, as stated earlier, that there is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore,
      the removal of this one basic error is the first, the primary step, for  the
      simple reason
    that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
    will avail. ... <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">read the whole essay</a></p>
