<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.</p>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
    not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
    Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is
    the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this.</p>
  <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt.</p>
  <p>Now discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to equally
    tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the true rule, that
    taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion of the general prosperity,
    the securing of substantial equality, and the recognition of inalienable
    rights, let us consider upon what species of property it may be best laid.</p>
  <p>To consider what is included in the category of property is to see the absurdity
    of saying that all property should be equally taxed. For not to speak of
    minor differences that arise from application and use, there are commonly
    included under this term things of essentially different nature. Whatever
    is recognized by municipal law as subject to ownership is property. But between
    things thus classed together are wide differences. In the first place, there
    are certain of them which have in themselves no value, but are merely the
    representatives or doubles of property in itself valuable. Such are stocks,
    bonds, mortgages, promissory notes of all kinds, whether made by individuals
    or issued by governments to serve as money, solvent debts, book-accounts,
    etc. These things may be to the individual valuable property, and are correctly
    included in any estimate of his wealth. But they are no part of the wealth
    of the community. Their increase does not make the community a whit the richer;
    and they may be utterly destroyed without the community becoming a whit the
    poorer. If I buy a horse, giving my note for the amount, the result of the
    transaction (supposing me to be solvent) is that the seller gets property
    to the value of the horse, while I get the horse. But there has been no increase
    in wealth. To the seller, my note may be quite as good as the horse, and
    in estimating his wealth it may be as properly included as the horse; but
    if the note be destroyed, the community is nothing the poorer, while if the
    horse break his neck, there is a lessening of the general wealth by one horse.
    And so, the issuance of bonds by a government, or the watering of stock by
    a corporation, can in no wise increase the general sum of wealth, nor will
    any diminution either in the amount or in the selling price of such bonds
    or stock reduce it. If all the governments of the world were to repudiate
    their debts tomorrow, an immense amount of property, now carefully guarded,
    would become waste paper, and thousands of people now rich would be made
    poor, but the wealth of the human race would not be diminished one iota.</p>
  <p>These are truisms. Yet so widespread and persistent is the notion that all
    property should be taxed, that they are generally ignored. Nothing is clearer
    than that when a farmer who wants more capital puts a mortgage on his farm,
    no new value is thereby created. Yet, in most of our States, both the farm
    and the mortgage are taxed; though so obvious is the double taxation that
    in some of them the clumsy expedient of making an exemption to the debtor
    is resorted to.</p>
  <p>But it is manifest that property of this kind is not a fit subject for taxation,
    and ought not to be considered in making up the assessment rolls. It has,
    in itself, no value. It is merely the representative, or token, of value &#8212; the
    certificate of ownership, or the obligation to pay value. It either represents
    other property, or property yet to be brought into existence. And, as nothing
    real can be drawn from that which is not real, taxation upon property of
    this kind must ultimately fall, either upon the property represented, in
    which case there is double taxation, or upon those whose obligations it expresses,
    in which case men are taxed, not upon what they own, but upon what they owe;
    and all cumbrous devices to prevent the unjust effects of such taxation,
    like other complications of the revenue system, simply give to the stronger
    and more unscrupulous opportunities of throwing the burden upon the weaker
    and more conscientious. Property of this kind ought not to be taxed at all.
    Property in itself valuable is clearly that with which any wise scheme of
    taxation should alone deal.</p>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. <strong>We
    may tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree
    lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. </strong>But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. <strong>We might take the
    whole value of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth
    nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. </strong>The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p>And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

      <p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
        have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought
        about under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth.
        It is the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes
        a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth.
        Let us work by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against
        it, it is hard pulling and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take some
rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.*</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar
            with economic terminology may assume, the whole amount paid for the
            use of real estate. It is only that part of such amount which is
            paid for the use of the bare land or site employed, exclusive of
            the payment for the use of any buildings or other improvements on
            it. H. G. B.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of
        land need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the
        amount of land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State
        in taxes, land, no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels
        it was held, would be really common property, and every member of the
        community would participate in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
      <p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily
        be increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition
        into practical form by proposing --</p>
      <p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land
            values.</em></strong></p>
      <p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
        but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance
        of the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country,
        even the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient
        to bear the entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries
        it is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to
        place all taxes upon the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent
        exceeds the present governmental revenues, commensurately to increase
        the amount demanded in taxation, and to continue this increase as society
        progresses and rent advances. But this is so natural and easy a matter,
        that it may be considered as involved, or at least understood, in the
        proposition to put all taxes on the value of land. That is the first
        step upon which the practical struggle must be made. When the hare is
        once caught and killed, cooking him will follow as a matter of course.
        When the common right to land is so far appreciated that all taxes are
        abolished save those which fall upon rent, there is no danger of much
        more than is necessary to induce them to collect the public revenues
        being left to individual landholders.</p>
      <p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds
        lodgment sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way,
        but there are few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first,
        or even for a long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is
          a real antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
        <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over
          the idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly
          to tax them.</li>
        <li> It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
          capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
          poorer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
        there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature,
        education, and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great
        wrong which in every civilized country condemns the masses of men to
        poverty and want, will not die without a bitter struggle. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/07_Simplicity_Introducing.htm">read the

<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p>    <strong>7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
    wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country.</strong> (51.)</p>
  <p>The idea, as expressed by Arthur Young, that &#8220;the magic of property
    turns barren sands to gold&#8221; springs from the confusion of ownership
    with possession, of which I have before spoken, that attributes to private
    property in land what is due to security of the products of labor. <strong>It
    is needless for me again to point out that the change we propose, the taxation
    for public uses of land values, or economic rent, and the abolition of other
    taxes, would give to the user of land far greater security for the fruits
    of his labor than the present system and far greater permanence of possession. </strong>Nor is it necessary further to show how it would give homes to those who
    are now homeless and bind men to their country. <strong>For under it every
    one who wanted a piece of land for a home or for productive use could get
    it without
    purchase price and hold it even without tax, since the tax we propose would
    not fall on all land, nor even on all land in use, but only on land better
    than the poorest land in use, and is in reality not a tax at all, but merely
    a return to the state for the use of a valuable privilege.</strong> And even those
    who from circumstances or occupation did not wish to make permanent use of
    land would still have an equal interest with all others in the land of their
    country and in the general prosperity.</p>
  <p>But I should like your Holiness to consider how utterly unnatural is the
    condition of the masses in the richest and most progressive of Christian
    countries; how large bodies of them live in habitations in which a rich man
    would not ask his dog to dwell; how the great majority have no homes from
    which they are not liable on the slightest misfortune to be evicted; how
    numbers have no homes at all, but must seek what shelter chance or charity
    offers. I should like to ask your Holiness to consider how the great majority
    of men in such countries have no interest whatever in what they are taught
    to call their native land, for which they are told that on occasions it is
    their duty to fight or to die. What right, for instance, have the majority
    of your countrymen in the land of their birth? Can they live in Italy outside
    of a prison or a poorhouse except as they buy the privilege from some of
    the exclusive owners of Italy? Cannot an Englishman, an American, an Arab
    or a Japanese do as much? May not what was said centuries ago by Tiberius
    Gracchus be said today: &#8220;Men of Rome! you are called the lords of the
    world, yet have no right to a square foot of its soil! The wild beasts have
    their dens, but the soldiers of Italy have only water and air!&#8221;</p>
  <p>What is true of Italy is true of the civilized world &#8212; is becoming
    increasingly true. It is the inevitable effect as civilization progresses
    of private property in land. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>      AND while in the nature of things any change from wrong-doing to right-doing
      must entail loss upon those who profit by the wrong-doing, and this can
        no more be prevented than can parallel lines be made to meet; yet it
        must also
      be remembered that in the nature of things the loss is merely relative,
        the gain absolute. Whoever will examine the subject will see that in
        the abandonment
      of the present unnatural and unjust method of raising public revenues and
      the adoption of the natural and just method even those who relatively lose
      will be enormous gainers. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

          MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would
            be hard to find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while
            the general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the
            capitalist. So
  true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to
            put all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely
            reduce all great
  fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
  who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest
            landowner in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation
            would largely reduce his
  enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income
            from them, and doubtless much personal property in various other
            shapes. He would
  still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
  society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><strong><font size="-1">I. THE SINGLE TAX DEFINED</font></strong></p>
  <p>The practical form in which Henry George puts the idea of appropriating
    economic rent to common use is &quot;To abolish all taxation save that upon
    land values.&quot;</p>
  <p>This is now generally known as &quot;The Single Tax.&quot;2 Under its operation
    all classes of workers, whether manufacturers, merchants, bankers, professional
    men, clerks, mechanics, farmers, farm-hands, or other working classes, would,
    as such, be wholly exempt. It is only as men own land that they would be
    taxed, the tax of each being in proportion, not to the area, but to value
    of his land. And no one would be compelled to pay a higher tax than others
    if his land were improved or used while theirs was not, nor if his were better
    improved or better used than theirs.3 The value of its improvements would
    not be considered in estimating the value of a holding; site value alone
    would govern.4 If a site rose in the market the tax would proportionately
    increase; if that fell, the tax would proportionately diminish.</p>
  <p>The single tax may be concisely described as a tax upon land alone, in the
    ratio of value, irrespective of improvements or use. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Land,&#8221; in the language of economics, includes all natural resources:
      the three-dimensional space on the surface of the Earth (including space
    in and on water); material land such as minerals, water, and oil; the electromagnetic
      spectrum; wildlife (including wild animals and forests); and satellite
    orbits.</p>
  <p>The most important potential source of public revenue from land is real
    estate sites. The income from land has been called &#8220;ground rent,&#8221; &#8220;economic
      rent,&#8221; or just &#8220;rent.&#8221; The term &#8220;rent&#8221; here will
      refer to the income only from the land, excluding what is paid for the use
      of the improvements. The &#8220;economic rent&#8221; with respect to land refers
      to the maximum that a tenant would bid for the use of the site. I have called
      this &#8220;geo-rent&#8221; to differentiate it from &#8220;rent&#8221; as
      a payment for any resource or from the actual amount a tenant may pay,
      which could be less than what the market could bear.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation taps the geo-rent. Like today&#8217;s real property
    tax, a land value tax would have some tax rate that would tap some percentage
    of
      the land value or rent. I suggest 80 percent of the geo-rent be used for
    public revenue. The landowner would pay it from the rental he collects from
    the tenant,
      or if owner-occupied, from the implicit rental value he obtains from the
    site. The 80 percent rate would leave some of the land rent with the landowner
    to
      have a margin for assessment error and also to maintain a positive price
    for the land to facilitate its sale. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>PART 5: Land Value Taxation in Theory and Practice</p>
  <p>Significant land value taxation was adopted in several countries. ...</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
    Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
    and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of
    local public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
    don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
    to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not taxed
    if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation reduces
    the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
    funds in an enterprise.</p>
  <p>When public finance is based on land value taxation, government revenues
    flow up, instead of trickling down from the federal government to the states
    and then to local governments. Real estate taxes today are assessed and collected
    primarily by county governments; under a system of land value taxation, funds
    raised would flow up from the counties to the states, and only then to the
    federal government.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would create a decentralizing force, shifting or &#8220;devolving&#8221; power
    down to local government in accord with the principle of subsidiarity: that
    which can be most efficiently done by individuals or smaller jurisdictions
    should not be done by larger or higher-level jurisdictions. Government functions
    would then come under more observation and control by the voters, who can
    monitor and alter local governments much more easily than remote federal
    agencies.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Summary and Concluding Remarks</p>
  <p>An ideal public revenue policy respects a person&#8217;s right to privacy,
    does not discourage work or savings, and does not induce dishonesty. While
    income, sales, and value-added taxes fall woefully short of this ideal, land
    value taxation meets each requirement.</p>
  <p>Imagine the increased prosperity and opportunities for advancement that
    would exist if people could keep all of the money they earn; if billions
    of dollars wasted on efforts to avoid high income taxes were suddenly turned
    to productive endeavors; and if the growth of government were constrained
    by a tax system that would raise only enough to pay for services actually
    provided.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation is central to the political philosophy of the founding
    fathers of the United States. Far from being a new idea, or the idea of a
    small group of thinkers, it is a concept embraced by many of the most important
    figures from our history: John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson,
    and today, Milton Friedman. Land value taxation is part of America&#8217;s
    proud and distinguished tradition of political philosophy. Surely it belongs
    in the national debate over how best to reform the nation&#8217;s tax system.</p>
  <p>The shift from taxing productive human action to collecting the economic
    rent generated by nature and communities is more than a fiscal reform. There
    is a philosophical and even spiritual side to this reform.</p>
  <p>One of the ongoing problems of social philosophy is the relationship of
    the individual to society. In conventional tax policy, there is an inherent
    conflict between the individual and government as the agent of society. Individuals
    want to benefit from the collective services provided by government, but
    the mechanisms for financing those services typically have used force against
    individuals and invaded their private lives.</p>
  <p>The collection of land rent for public revenue reconciles the individual
    and the community. The community and its government no longer intrude into
    the individual&#8217;s private life and stifle his or her pursuit of economic
    well being. The tax on land value is not a tax in substance, but only in
    the form of payments to government. In substance, the payment is a sharing
    of the benefits provided by community and nature, and a payment for the services
    that generate the value of the land. If this payment is not made by the landholder,
    the services become a subsidy, producing a value not returned to the community.</p>
  <p>The public collection of land rent can induce an efficient use of land.
    Land value taxation gives land a &#8220;carrying cost,&#8221; inducing title
    holders to put their land to its most productive current use, rather than
    hold it awaiting higher prices. With the price of land thus kept low, banks
    would lend for productive investments rather than to buy land.</p>
  <p>Public revenue from land rent is a necessary element of true free trade
    and a genuinely free market. Even a small and flat income tax, sales tax,
    or tariff grants government the power to intrude into transactions, adding
    friction that reduces the flexibility of an economy. The elimination of this
    friction and deadweight loss is made possible by land value taxation.</p>
  <p>The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system benefits
    certain vested interests that will resist reform. But since the public at
    large will benefit from a shift to land value taxation, and since they greatly
    outnumber those obtaining privileges from the current system, the greater
    reason why this tax reform has not taken place is that the public has not
    been informed. Once citizens, taxpayers, consumers, and voters understand
    the option of obtaining public revenue from land value or rent, then the
    logic of getting both greater efficiency and greater justice may well prevail.

<p>Al Hartheimer: <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Hartheimer_AHatLVTP.html">Affordable
    Housing and the Land Value Tax Perspective: a letter to Asheville, North
Carolina</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To make housing more affordable we advocate
      the reduction of the tax on buildings and a simultaneous rise of the tax
      on land to yield the same or more revenue. This is called Land Value Taxation.
      It is also called the two-rate tax, incentive taxation and the split-rate
      tax.</span> </p>
  <p>We know, from studies of the twenty Pennsylvania taxing jurisdictions that
    use LVT, that every time the tax on buildings is reduced, and simultaneously
    the tax on land is increased, that there is a spurt of construction. According
    to Plassmann and Tideman (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effects
    of Two-Rate Property Taxes in Pennsylvania</span>, Florenz Plassmann and
    T. Nicholas Tideman, September 1997, p19), "This means that, for an average
    municipality, an increase in the adjusted tax differential of 1 mil will
    yield an expected increase in the total value of construction of 1.58%".
    Much of this increase in construction comes from people improving their homes
    with the knowledge that the penalty for making improvements is being reduced. </p>
  <p>Does this provide more affordable housing? Pittsburgh has used the two-rate
    tax since 1915, 85 years. Recently, Lew Sichelman (The Housing Scene, by
    Lew Sichelman, the Los Angeles Times, Sunday, June 4, 2000) said "According
    to the federal government's latest tabulation, the average of both new and
    existing houses sold in 31 key markets nationwide reached $200,300 during
    the first three months of this year&#8230;. The San Francisco Bay Area&#8230;remains
    the most expensive place in the country in which to buy a house. The average
    price there is now $384,700. &#8230;At the other end of the price spectrum,
    the average remains under $150,000 in only two places: Pittsburgh at $143,300&#8230;.and
    St. Louis at $145,100." So Pittsburgh, the only sizeable city in the United
    States to use the two-rate tax, has the lowest cost housing in the country.
    A coincidence? Perhaps not. </p>
  <p>An interesting and amazing thing about the Pittsburgh experience is that
    the two-rate tax in Pittsburgh applies only to the city tax, not to the school
    tax and not to the county tax. It's impressive to say that for the city tax
    the tax rate on land is six times higher than the tax rate on buildings,
    but because of the much higher value of buildings, only about 57% of the
    city tax is from land. When you add the school tax and the county tax, less
    than 40% of the tax yield is from land. </p>
  <p>So a modest land tax applied over a long time (85 years) results in the
    lowest average cost of housing in the country. Imagine what would happen
    if the tax on buildings were eliminated and all of the city revenue came
    from the land tax. It boggles the mind to think about it. ... <a href="../docs/Hartheimer_AHatLVTP.html">read

<p>Ted Gwartney: <a href="docs/Gwartney_Sprawl.html">A Free Market Strategy to
    Reduce Sprawl </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What is needed is a continuously self-renewing city and a public policy that
    can work effectively. Buildings have a limited useful life. Continuous maintenance
    and frequent retrofitting sometimes extends this life span. Other buildings
    reach a point where they should be replaced. Some buildings sit vacant for
    decades even in the city's central business district. Valuable parcels of land
    are left undeveloped or paved over and used as surface parking lots. The result
  is a lower tax base and an eyesore.</p>
  <p>As urban buildings deteriorate, owners often don't renovate, remodel or make
    repairs because their property tax may rise. Thus the typical property tax
    creates suburban sprawl and urban decay. Shifting the property tax off buildings
    and onto land reverses these processes. Taxing land more than buildings usually
    reduces taxes for homeowners.</p>
  <p>One means that has long been available but not brought into general use is
    to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin to impose an annual
    tax on land sites that makes holding land off the market for speculation a
    costly proposition. An annual fee on land should be set near what the land
    site alone would yield if rented by the owner to the highest bidder. Think
    of how this would change the behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of
    land with a rental value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged
    me as my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
    greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would either develop
    the land myself or put it on the market so that someone else would develop
    it. At the same time, if my tax rate on the building I constructed on the land
    was zero, my incentive is to construct a building that maximizes my cash flow
    (i.e., to develop the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At
    minimum, land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto
    the market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to builders
    would tend to begin to fall over time.</p>
  <p>This is where the anti-sprawl component appears. As the city begins to renew
    itself -- as property owners are no longer penalized when they renovate or
    build new structures -- businesses and people will increasingly see the city
    as a more desirable place and not just in a few neighborhoods that now benefit
    by abatement programs and public subsidies.</p>
  <p>Exempting property improvements from taxation and collecting all of the property
    tax from land values (which are created by the community as a whole and not
    by individuals) is the cornerstone to continuous self-renewal and the reduction
    of urban sprawl. Community leaders, residents and business owners can discuss
    how this renewal will take place, to ensure that neighborhoods retain existing
    amenities and create new ones that will make every neighborhood vital and attractive.
    By correcting this serious structural flaw in tax policy that has existed for
    so long, people will gradually return to city, contributing to its self-renewal.</p>
  <p>By utilizing land within cities efficiently and in response to the demand
    for its use, open space and natural habitats outside the city will be conserved.
    If urban land is used to its highest and best use, farm land and environmentally
    sensitive land will not be required for inappropriate uses. Builders and developers
    would not have to bypass serviced but vacant land to construct housing at a
    further distance from where it is needed or wanted. ... <a href="docs/Gwartney_Sprawl.html">read

    Land Value Taxation to Problems of Environmental Protection, Congestion,
    Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation generalizes into the principle that people should pay
    for all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to the
    opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting revenue should
  be shared equally. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxing land has an additional effect that increases the stock of capital.
    A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults to the young and
    unborn, who will now be born with rights to land. Unless there is a perfectly
    offsetting reduction in the desire to accumulate assets to transfer to the
    next generation, this redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer
    assets, to accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
  is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</p>
  <p>Taxing land also increases the efficiency with which land is used. This occurs
    through three paths.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land speculation, and therefore
          reduces the quantity of land speculation. </li>
    <li>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling price of land,
          the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the annual tax)
      for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land relatively more
      attractive
          to bidders with high discount rates and relatively less attractive
      to bidders with low discount rates. To the extent that the former are more
      entrepreneurial
          and the latter more passive investors, land will tend to flow into
      the hands of persons who will choose to use it more intensively. </li>
    <li>The third path by which a tax on land increases the efficiency with which
          land is used is that, for those who are using land inefficiently, it
      substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an implicit one (the income
      foregone by inefficient
          use). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Psychologically, explicit costs tend to be more effective in motivating efficient
    behavior than implicit ones. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>There are undoubtedly many other problems to be resolved before the ills

Weld Carter: <a
 href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">An
Introduction to Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Taxation </b><br>
  It was but a short step from the ethics of property to the ethics of taxation.
      George's position here was that as labor and capital rightfully and unconditionally
      own what they produce, no one can rightfully appropriate any of their earnings;
      nor can the State. On the other hand, land value is always a socially created
      value, never the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this
      is a value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
      the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs. Furthermore,
      to charge the owner for this value, in the form of taxation, is only to
      collect from him the precise value of the benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on products,
    George spoke of "...all taxes now levied on the products and processes of
    industry -- which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold
    to be infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of the
      justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith speaks of incomes
      as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and this is the ground
      upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly insisted
      upon -- that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of this idea
      is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by the state
      -- that there is a value created and maintained by the community, which
      is justly called upon to meet community expenses. Now of what values is
      this true? Only of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise
      until a community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with
      the growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists. Scatter
      again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
      at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises; with
      every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is, therefore,
    the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive
    from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion
    to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use
    of the community, that value which is the creation of the community. It is
    the application the common property to common uses."&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
      state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
      with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. <em><strong>Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party.</strong></em> The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation.</p>
  <p>One must be careful not to confuse land-value with the price of land. The
      price of land is the sum demanded for the transference from one individual
      to another of the privilege to collect and retain land-value and thus to divert
      public earnings to private pockets.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Under the normal system which this article advocates, the user
          of land would pay substantially the same economic rent as now, for the
          reason that economic
      rent is fixed by the payer and not by the payee; but it would be paid to the
      credit of the community instead of for the benefit of the individual landowner.
      And the economic rent is all the land user would have to pay; no taxes on industry
      or personal product and no other forced contribution for governmental purposes.</em></strong> ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read

    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
    sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained largely
    as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or two have
    buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of
    major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in land. American
    cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least
    when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
    value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers reflect
    enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted because of
    the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from
    the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive market
    presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty
    on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their maintenance.
    Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise
    be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and
    best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges
    of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly
    since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated
    for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with
    administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes
    over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
