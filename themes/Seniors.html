  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seniors<br>

  <p>When &quot;property tax reform&quot; is proposed, one of the beneficiaries
    is supposed to be the senior citizen homeowner who gets some protection from
    rising property
    taxes. The municipality's need for revenue doesn't go down; someone else
    must pay, either through higher millage rates on their land and buildings,
    or through
    parcel taxes, or through sales taxes or wage taxes. </p>
  <p>California has taken this to an extreme, with Proposition 13, enacted in
    1978, and while it has done a magnificent job of &quot;protecting&quot; homeowning seniors
    from rising property taxes (while California has one of the lowest homeownership
    rates in the entire US &#8212; well under 60%, compared to nearly 70% nationwide
    (and probably about 72% for the other 49 states) &#8212; California's
    seniors actually have a higher homeownership rate than seniors in the rest
    of the US!), the results have been disastrous from nearly every other point
    of view. California's housing affordability is among the lowest in the country,
    and the runup in housing prices, traceable largely to Proposition 13, has
    been stunning.</p>
  <p>As the articles below point out, there are better ways to protect seniors,
    without burdening our young people and prolonging the adolescence of our children. </p>
  <p>He probably wasn't the first, but Winston Churchill pointed out the extent
    to which things which serve wealthy or privileged special interests are usually
    presented as being in the interests of widows. As he put it, let's give the
    widow a
    rest!

        Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
      Capacity of Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The question I am
assigned is
whether the taxable capacity of land without buildings is up to the job
of financing cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough?
The answer is "yes."</small><br>
<br>
<small>The universal state and local revenue problem today is
whether
we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is exemplified
by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of California. He keeps
repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes and public services, or
drive out business and jobs. (When a public figure gives you two
choices you know they're both bad, and he wants one of them.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>The unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based on
land
ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of driving
away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You certainly
will not drive away the land. However high the tax rate, not one square
foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of town. The only bad
thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is that it stimulates
revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people think that is bad, maybe
this attitude is the problem. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>There is the answer to Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope
here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Most California land, on
the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" &#8212; there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">State law allows the SID to
contract with the landowner as follows.</span><small
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small><small>You don't have to pay your annual charge
in cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></small></small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Objectively, it looks like
a good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way. <a

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Might the PTS fall heavily on low-income land
holders and elderly homeowners? The land-rich, money-poor old widow
could suffer if society were to levy sites. Eventho' the vast majority
of poor people would come out ahead, there probably will be the rare
exception. To deal with "the widow on a valuable lot", the new policy
could include <span style="font-weight: bold;">deferments</span>.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Wyn Achenbaum: <a

Domain and Government Giveaways<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am sympathetic to those who
want to occupy their homes forever, but
if those homes are located on land that is valuable (because of its
views or water access or transportation services, for example) or
becomes valuable because of surrounding development, it seems fair that
they compensate the rest of us for holding up progress, for continuing
to occupy as single-family residences, land which it is now time to
develop into something that produces good results for the entire
community.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or
something else
that was a highly appropriate use for its site -- and typical of the
neighborhood -- 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial
buildings. The home or diner is something everyone else has to walk
around, drive around. If that site were well developed, it could
prevent the premature development of far less desirable sites on the
fringe of town -- an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
acres on the fringe.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Should we protect the right of elderly people to stay in their
homes,
at the expense of the rest of the community? Should we protect the
right of a young person who shares that home to stay there for an
entire lifetime, at the expense of the community? I'm comfortable with
the idea of allowing the elderly person to defer payment of the
property taxes, with interest-bearing debt accruing against the
property until it is sold or transferred. It seems to me to be an
acceptable tradeoff, even if it creates potholes in the redevelopment.
But his heirs should not inherit it until the lien is satisfied, which
will usually mean that at last it will be developed consistent with the
neighborhood.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed,
land
first and buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which
tell us when it might be time to move on. ... <a
