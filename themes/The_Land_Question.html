    a bit more obvious in Ireland. Some years later, he retitled it simply <em>The

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small> Do you know that I do not think that the average man realises what
      land is? I know a little girl who has been going to school for some time,
      studying geography, and all that sort of thing; and one day she said to
      me: "Here is something about the surface of the earth. I wonder what the
      surface of the earth looks like?" "Well," I said, "look out into the yard
      there. That is the surface of the earth." She said, "That the surface of
      the earth? Our yard the surface of the earth? Why, I never thought of it!" That
      is very much the case not only with grown men, but with such wise beings
      as newspaper editors. They seem to think, when you talk of land, that you
      always refer to farms; to think that the land question is a question that
      relates entirely to farmers, as though land had no other use than growing
      crops. Now, I should like to know how a man could even edit a newspaper
      without having the use of some land. He might swing himself by straps and
      go up in a balloon, but he could not even then get along without land.
      What supports the balloon in the air? Land; the surface of the earth. Let
      the earth drop, and what would become of the balloon? The air that supports
      the balloon is supported in turn by land. So it is with everything else
      men can do. Whether a man is working away three thousand feet under the
      surface of the earth or whether he is working up in the top of one of those
      immense buildings that they have in New York; whether he is ploughing the
      soil or sailing across the ocean, he is still using </small><small>land.</small> </p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Land! Why, in owning a piece of ground,
    what do you own? The lawyers will tell you that you own from the centre
    of the earth right up to heaven; and, so far as all human purposes go, you
    do. In New York they are building houses thirteen and fourteen stories high.
    What are men, living in those upper stories, paying for? There is a friend
    of mine who has an office in one of them, and he estimates that he pays by
    the cubic foot for air. Well, the man who owns the surface of the land has
    the renting of the air up there, and would have if the buildings were carried
    up for miles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This land question is the bottom question.
    Man is a land animal. Suppose you want to build a house; can you build it
    without a place to put it? What is it built of? Stone, or mortar, or wood,
    or iron &#8212; they all come from the earth. <b>Think of any article of
    wealth you choose, any of those things which men struggle for, where do they
    come from? From the land. It is the bottom question. The land question is
    simply the labour question; and when some men own that element from which
    all wealth must be drawn, and upon which all must live, then they have the
    power of living ose who do work get less of the products of work. ... </b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>... Men are compelled to compete with each other for the wages of
      an employer, because they have been robbed of the natural opportunities
      of employing themselves; because they cannot find a piece of God's world
      on which to work without paying some other human creature for the privilege. </small></p>
  <p><small> I do not mean to say that even after you had set right this fundamental
      injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this I do mean to
      say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of all social questions.
      This I do mean to say, that, do what you please, reform as you may, <b>you
      never can get rid of wide-spread poverty so long as the element on which
      and from which all men must live is made the private property of some men.
      It is utterly impossible. Reform government &#8212; get taxes down to the
      minimum &#8212; build railroads; institute co-operative stores; divide
      profits, if you choose, between employers and employed-and what will be
      the result? The result will be that the land will increase in value &#8212; that
      will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else. Experience shows this.
      Do not all improvements simply increase the value of land &#8212; the price
      that some must pay others for the privilege of living? ...</b> <a

    it is best that the truth be fully stated and clearly recognized.
    He who sees the truth, let him proclaim it, without asking who is for
    it or who is against it. This is not radicalism in the bad sense
    which so many attach to the word. This is conservatism in the true
    sense. </p>
  <p>What gives to the Irish Land Question its supreme significance is
    that it brings into attention and discussion &#8211; nay, that it forces
    into attention and discussion, not a mere Irish question, but a
    question of world-wide importance. <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p>I HAVE dwelt so long upon this question of compensating
    landowners, not merely because it is of great practical importance,
    but because its discussion brings clearly into view the principles
    upon which the land question, in any country, can alone be justly and
    finally settled. In the light of these principles we see that
    landowners have no rightful claim either to the land or to
    compensation for its resumption by the people, and, further than
    that, we see that no such rightful claim can ever be created. <b>It
    would be wrong to pay the present landowners for "their" land at the
    expense of the people; it would likewise be wrong to sell it again to
    smaller holders. It would be wrong to abolish the payment of rent,
    and to give the land to its present cultivators</b>. In the very
    nature of things, land cannot rightfully be made individual property.
    This principle is absolute. The title of a peasant proprietor
    deserves no more respect than the title of a great territorial noble.
    No sovereign political power, no compact or agreement, even though
    consented to by the whole population of the globe, can give to an
    individual a valid title to the exclusive ownership of a square inch
    of soil. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The earth is an entailed
    estate &#8211; entailed upon all the
    generations of the children of men, by a deed written in the
    constitution of Nature, a deed that no human proceedings can bar, and
    no proscription determine. </span>Each succeeding generation has but a
    tenancy for life. Admitting that any set of men may barter away their
    own natural rights (and this logically involves an admission of the
    right of suicide), they can no more barter away the rights of their
    successors than they can barter away the rights of the inhabitants of
    other worlds. ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

  <p>Note 2: In &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iv, Henry George
    speaks of &quot;the effect of substituting for the manifold taxes now imposed,
    a single tax on the value of land&quot;; but the term did not become a distinctive
    name until 1888.</p>
  <p>The first general movement along the lines of &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; began
    New York City election of 1886, when Henry George polled 68,110 votes as
    an independent candidate for mayor, and was defeated by the Democratic candidate,
    Abram S. Hewitt, by a plurality of only 22,442, the Republican, Theodore
    Roosevelt, polling but 60,435. Following that election the United Labor Party
    was formed, the Syracuse Convention in August, 1887, by the exclusion of
    the Socialists, came to present the central idea of &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; as
    distinguished from the Socialistic propaganda which until then was identified
    with it. Coincident with the organization of the United Labor Party the Anti-Poverty
    Society was formed; and the two bodies, one representing the political and
    the other the religious phase of the idea, worked together until President
    Cleveland's tariff message of 1887 appeared. In this message Mr. George saw
    the timid beginnings of that open struggle between protection and free trade
    to which he had for years looked forward as the political movement that must
    culminate in the abolition of all taxes save those upon land values, and
    he responded at once to the sentiments of the message. But many protectionists,
    who had followed him because they supposed he was a land nationalizer, now
    broke away from his leadership, and the United Labor Party and the Anti-Poverty
    Society were soon practically dissolved. <strong>Those who understood Mr.
    George's real position regarding the land question readily acquiesced in
    his views
    as to political policy,</strong> and a considerable movement resulted, which,
    however, for some time lacked an identifying name. This was the situation
    when Thomas
    G. Shearman, Esq., wrote for the Standard an article on taxation in which
    he illustrated and advocated the land value tax as a fiscal measure. The
    article had been submitted without a caption, and Mr. George, then the editor
    of the Standard, entitled it &quot;The Single Tax.&quot; This title was at
    once adopted by the &quot;George men,&quot; as they were often called, and
    has ever since served as the name of the movement it describes. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q43. Is there any land question in places where land is cheap? In Texas,
      for example, you can get land as cheap as two dollars an acre. Is there
      a land question there?</em><br>
A. There is no place where land is cheap in the sense implied by the question.
Land commands a low price in many places, but it is poor land; it is not cheap
land. It is true that in Texas there is land that can be had for two dollars
an acre, but it would yield less profit to each unit of labor and capital expended
upon it than land in New York City which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars
an acre. The valuable New York land is the cheaper of the two. The land question
is the question in every place where land costs more than it is worth for immediate
use. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
      Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. <strong>Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing
    affordability and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the
    land question.&#8217;</strong></p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. The role of land
    in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic growth
    was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo
    and Malthus. But the intervening years have seen land slide into a more peripheral
    status within economic analysis. Political economists working in the Marxian
    tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as
    the key to understanding the capitalist economy. Neo-classical economists
    typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of
    production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists
    have also given little attention to land because typically their analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.<br>
    <br>
    However, there is an alternative current of political economic thought for
      which &#8216;the land question&#8217; is central. This is the tradition
      based on the ideas of Henry George. This article seeks a balanced assessment
      of the usefulness of George&#8217;s ideas in the modern context. It outlines
      how insights derived from Georgist thinking can help in dealing with contemporary
      economic, social and environmental problems, while noting deficiencies
      and additional concerns. Following a general summary of Georgist ideas
      and policy proposals, six themes are addressed:</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> the moral issue,</li>
      <li> wealth inequality,</li>
      <li> housing affordability,</li>
      <li> environmental concerns,</li>
      <li> urban development and</li>
      <li> economic cycles.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
    <p>In each case it is argued that Georgist insights provide a valuable but
        incomplete basis for analysis and policy. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
