<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Even a relatively flat income tax imposes what economists call a &#8220;deadweight
      loss&#8221; or &#8220;excess burden&#8221; on society. Taxes on productive
      activity increase the price of labor or goods beyond economic costs, and
      so reduce the quantity provided. This reduction in production, income,
      and investment
      is a misallocation of resources. Resources are wasted because they do not
      go to where they are most wanted. We can reduce this excess burden by reducing
      taxes, but changing the type of tax can also reduce this deadweight loss.
      Economists
      recognize that if we tap for public revenue a resource whose quantity is
      fixed, the excess burden disappears. The tax does not reduce the supply
      and does not
      increase prices. ... </p>
  <p>In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and
    Poverty</span> (1879), his most important book, Henry George contended the ideal
    tax would most closely conform to the following conditions, similar to those
    of Smith:</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. That the tax bears as lightly as possible
      upon production, minimizing the excess burden or deadweight loss.<br>
      2. That the revenues be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly
      as may be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as
      little as possible in addition to what it yields the government.<br>
      3. That it be certain and visible, so as to give the least opportunity for
      tyranny or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to
      lawbreaking and evasion on the part of the taxpayers.<br>
      4. That it be equitable, giving no citizen an arbitrary advantage or privilege,
      and in being consistent with moral principles.<small> ...</small></div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Impact on
    production<br>
    <br>
    </span>It is widely understood that when something is taxed, we get less
    of it. As discussed above, this reduction in labor, production, and investment
    is called
    the &#8220;excess burden&#8221; or &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; of taxation.
    Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes discourage
    consumption, capital gains taxes discourage investment, and real property
    taxes discourage
    building and improving property. Those taxes make the asset or activity more
    costly, which then reduces the
    quantity bought of the thing being taxed. <br>
    <br>
    What makes land different is that its supply is fixed, and it is independent
    of human action. When land value or rent is tapped for public revenue, the land
    does not shrink, flee, or hide. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The use of rent for public
revenues therefore has no excess burden, no
burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
land rather than raise it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal
source of
general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.
Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
other forms of land. There could also be user fees for services
specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
enterprises.</small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from
minerals,

of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
circumstances.</span></small>

for Taxing Land</a><br>

and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>When there is more than one tax in an economy, one must take
account of
the fact that the second tax will generally reduce the excess burden of
the first tax.&nbsp; This is because when you tax a good, say apples,
people buy other things instead, say bananas.&nbsp; If you then tax
bananas, some of the expenditure that no longer goes to bananas will go
back to apples, thereby reducing the magnitude of the tax-induced
shrinkage of the market for apples.&nbsp; If it were possible to tax
&#8216;everything&#8217; at the same rate, then people would pay the same total
amount in taxes no matter what they did, and there would be no excess
burden of taxes. </small><br>
<br>
<small>What makes it impossible to tax everything at the same rate is
that one
of the things that would need to be taxed is leisure.&nbsp; Taxing
authorities have not yet devised ways to maintain people&#8217;s tax
obligations when they decide to earn and spend less money.&nbsp; Thus
all systems that tax people according to what they receive (from
working or saving), or spend, generate excess burdens.&nbsp; They do
this by making the incentive to work less than the value of what people
produce and the incentive to save less than the productivity of
investments financed by saving.&nbsp; Still, systems of &#8216;broad-based&#8217;
taxes (e.g., sales taxes, income taxes and value added taxes) generally
have lower excess burdens than tax systems in which a variety of
individual goods and services are taxed at different rates.&nbsp;
Actual broad-based taxes generally have exceptions and
non-uniformities, and these generally increase the excess burdens that
the taxes cause.&nbsp; Still, one way in which a departure from
uniformity in taxation can promote efficiency is that, if there are
some goods and services that are particularly likely to be purchased in
greater quantity when people consume more leisure, then a somewhat
higher tax on these can serve as a partial substitute for taxing
leisure.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In addition to discouraging work, most tax systems discourage
saving by
taxing the proceeds of people&#8217;s savings.&nbsp; This results in less
saving and investment.&nbsp; With the passage of time, this can cause a
very large reduction in the amount of capital in an economy.&nbsp; And
a reduced stock of capital generally means that labor will be less
productive and wages will be lower.&nbsp; A tax system that taxed only
consumption and not saving would not have this com&shy;ponent of excess
burden. However, raising a given amount of revenue in a tax system that
did not tax saving would require a greater distor&shy;tion of the
labor/leisure decision than in a tax system that did tax saving</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Consider how the above analysis of excess burden changes when
land is
taxed.&nbsp; Elemen&shy;tary economics texts often offer the analysis
shown in Figure 2.&nbsp; The supply of land is said to be perfectly
inelastic, vertical.&nbsp; Thus when a tax introduces a wedge between
the price paid by buyers of land services and the price received by
seller, the quantity remains unchanged.&nbsp; The triangle
disappears.&nbsp; Thus there is no excess burden of a tax on
land.&nbsp; A tax on land is &#8216;neutral&#8217;. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>To summarize: If land is subject to a tax or combination of
taxes with
a present value that is independent of how the land is used, and if
potential investors are confident that the magnitude of the tax will
not exceed the value of using the land over the life of potential
invest&shy;ments, then a tax on land has no excess burden; it is
neutral. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
  <p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
    course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax.
    Most basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form,
    and they constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of
    any particular tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such
    principles but little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless
    of ideology or government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency,
    equity, administrability, simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax
    theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or all of
    these criteria: ... </p>
  <p><strong>Tax efficiency</strong> is much like tax neutrality, and is the
    measure of how much shifting of behavior it imposes, resulting in what is
    called &quot;excess burden,&quot; or &quot;deadweight loss&quot; on the economy.
    Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes are those that are shifted
    little if at all. Because the elasticities (a technical word for the slope
    of supply and demand curves) of each are very different, a tax on land values
    and a tax on improvement values have very contrastive effects on economic
    choices. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity is the best
    way of assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is another way
    of saying fixed supply. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The current trend toward returning

step in the right direction. But it encounters understandable

have the right definition of which states are rich and which are
poor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The level of well-being in a

they impose a drag on the economy.<span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This means that taxing away land
rent more relieves it from circulating
through labor and capital, allowing those factors in turn to be more
productive. Significantly, perhaps most importantly, the collection of
land rent, on account of its inelasticity, incurs no deadweight loss
like tax levies on labor and capital. The economy thus functions more
efficiently -- i.e. with less drag and friction.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Lest one believe that this excess burden, or so-called
deadweight loss,
is a negligible drag on the economy, studies show just the opposite.
One study calculates that it was equal to about 20 percent of the total
US economy in the mid-1990s, annually at least one trillion dollars in
lost output.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(23)</span></small>
Put another way, a well designed efficient revenue structure would
allow productivity to rise by that amount and effectively make our
income that much higher. For Great Britain, the comparable figure was
shown to be &pound;400 billion annually.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Deadweight loss is a concept understood by economists but not by
the
general public. But this is likely to change as discussion about the
merit of various taxation approaches is presented to the public.
Nations in the European Community are now required to publish their
calculations about the deadweight loss of the various tax schemes being
reviewed, precisely because of the recognition of its importance as a
factor of production.<small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those elements have a market
price, and can be -- indeed are -- often
subject to taxation.&nbsp; It is important to note, however, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">taxes on such Land are capitalized in the
market value of their worth; they cannot be passed forward or backward
because their supply is essentially inelastic.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This
is
important, as will be noted below, because imposing such taxes incurs
no excess burden on their use or upon the general economy.</span>&nbsp;
Taxing such bases is totally neutral and completely efficient.&nbsp;
Indeed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">failure </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">to tax Land as stated that leads to
economic distortions and causes an economy to function at a sub-optimal
level.</span>&nbsp; Land, whatever its form, has a market value only to
the extent that a human presence exists to make use of it, and it
acquires that value due to the accretion of economic rent, the return
that comes to rest on such factors. &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes on
Labor and Capital, in contrast, are always shifted.&nbsp;</span>
Studies of so-called tax incidence seldom trace the flow of tax burdens
beyond the first or second step of the shift.&nbsp; Textbooks and
research studies will note that particular burdens -- for instance, a
tax on the sale of goods -- will be partly borne by the vendor and
partly also by the consumer.&nbsp; The vendor in turn sees that tax
incorporated into the price he pays for the product at the wholesale
level; the consumer sees his burden reflected in the relative cost of
living of his tax jurisdiction -- which in turn affects the price of
his home and his wages.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
shift in taxes, as economic theory makes clear, are ultimately
converted to rent, and that rent, as capitalized in land prices, is its
final resting place.&nbsp;</span> It is a truism of classical economics
as carried through in the present day tradition of Georgist economics
that <span style="font-weight: bold;">all taxes come out of rent -- an
adage that has come to be abbreviated as <a href="ATCOR.html">ATCOR</a>.<small><small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What this insight
means is that all taxes not first imposed on Land and collected from
the rent that rests thereon are instead passed through the economy from
one party to another until they ultimately come to rest on Land, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">thereby
increasing the price of real estate</span></span>.&nbsp; The passing
along of tax burdens not only creates distortions in economic
transactions; it also constitutes an excess burden and an inefficiency
that handicaps economic performance.&nbsp; </small></div>

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Contemporary economists and
conventional tax theorists well recognize
that taxing Labor and Capital is detrimental to economic vitality --
politicians thrive on repeating this <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
nauseam</span>.&nbsp; Currently the Republican party candidates seem
best able to exploit resentment about the negative impact of
taxes.&nbsp; But they are not alone in failing to appreciate the nature
of tax shifting.&nbsp; What all fail to realize is that there are
notable exceptions to the rule that taxes are oppressive: any tax
imposed on an inelastic base -- that is, any form of Land --
constitutes no distortion or excess burden whatsoever.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Far from
spreading the burden of distribution over a wide array of&nbsp; tax
bases, the ideal tax, then, should be imposed solely on those factors
of production that form an inelastic base, i.e., that constitute forms
of Land -- whether they be locational sites, natural resources, the
spectrum, time slots, or others as they may arise in the future.&nbsp;</span>
Land, in any of its forms, is totally inelastic.&nbsp; Will Rogers in
his pithy way said it well, "Buy land.&nbsp; They ain't making any more
of the stuff."&nbsp; Mark Twain said it too. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax efficiency</span>
is much like tax neutrality, and is the measure of how much shifting of
behavior it imposes, resulting in what is called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"excess burden," or "deadweight loss" on
the economy</span>. Tax economists usually hold that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the best taxes are those that are
shifted little if at all</span>. Because the elasticities (a technical
word for the slope of supply and demand curves) of each are very
different, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a tax on land values and a
tax on improvement values have very contrastive effects on economic
choices</span>. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity is
the best way of assuring that taxes are not shifted.&nbsp; Zero
elasticity is another way of saying fixed supply. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>A tax that is neutral is
one that in no way alters the behavior
of the markets by its imposition; that is people perform and make
choices in the same way as if there was no tax at all.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small>
Because a tax on &#8220;land&#8221; broadly defined is inelastic, i.e., has a fixed
supply, any tax on this base is completely capitalized in the market
price of the land itself. It is, in effect, a tax on the land rent, or
a recapture of the land rent by government in the name of society, just
as the rent is a creation of that society.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">39"The striking result is
that a
tax on rent will lead to no
distortions or economic inefficiencies. Why not?&nbsp; Because a tax on
pure
economic rent does not change anyone's economic behavior. Demanders are
unaffected because their price is unchanged. The behavior of suppliers
is unaffected because the supply of land is fixed and cannot react.
Hence, the economy operates after the tax exactly as it did before the
tax--with no distortions or inefficiencies arising as a result of the
land tax." P. Samuelson and W. D. Nordhaus, Economics, 16th ed., p. 250.</font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>A land tax is efficient because there is no economic distortion
of
market choices as a consequence of its neutrality. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This means that
there is no wasted economic behavior in the form of excess burden or
deadweight loss typically associated with other tax designs.</span> As
an
example of the inefficiencies of other taxes, for example, one might
consider the altered behavior that occurs in consequence of the
presence of the income tax or the sales tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This deadweight loss in
American and British economies has been estimated to be roughly 20% of
the national domestic product in each nation. Put differently, were
there no deadweight loss as a result of the tax structure, the society
would essentially be 20% more productive &#8212; and 20% richer in the
aggregate.</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span

Burden of Taxation in the United States,&#8221; Journal of Accounting,
Auditing, and Finance, fall, 1991. Harrison, et al. calculate that the
deadweight loss of the current tax system of United States is a
trillion dollars annually. Nicolaus Tideman et al. have modeled &#8220;The
Avoidable Excess Burden of U.S. Broadbased Taxes,&#8221; in Public Finance
Review (September, 2002), showing a &#8220;net gain of about $10,000 per
worker (16% of NDP) in the first year, rising to $17,800 (23.7% of NDP)
after 20 years for the most productive tax reform, which involves
collecting 90% of the rent of land and using the income tax as a
residual tax. When the sales tax is used as the residual tax, the gain
per worker is about $3,300 less.&#8221; This and other work is summarized in
&#8220;The Gains from Taxing Land,&#8221; in Geophilos, No.03(1) (Spring, 2003),

personal income tax alone] takes Americans 5 billion hours each year.

law. Cheating is widespread; roughly one-fifth of income goes

Economy, Improve the Environment, and Get the Tax Man Off Our Backs,

further corroborated in Donald L. Barlett &amp; James B. Steele, The
Great American Tax Dodge (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 2000), where
the authors note (p. 23) that the proportion of U.S. taxpayers
deliberately engaged in cheating on their income taxes now approaches
&#8220;between one -third and one-half of the tax-paying population.&#8221;</small>...
