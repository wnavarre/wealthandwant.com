    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>,
    Chapter 8: Why a Land-Value Tax is Better than an Equal Tax on All Property</a> (in
    the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Book
    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
    is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This
    is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land,
    are in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will
      the equality ordained by Nature be attained. <strong>No citizen will have an
      advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and
      intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns. </strong>Then, but not till then,
      will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<big>Ronald Dworkin has made the contractarian

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dworkin's acknowledges that his

their personal circumstances would want to maximize their expected
utility, then, even in the absence of adjustments for incentive
effects, Dworkin's suggestion leads not to equal utilities, but
rather to equal marginal utilities of money, which generally implies
unequal utilities when people have different capacities to get
utility from money.</small></p>

Case for Taxing Land</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; This argument represents a refusal to make a distinction
that begs to be made.&nbsp; <strong>The first principle of economic justice is
that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; While some scholars have
asserted that people have rights to themselves but not to their
talents, this is nonsensical.&nbsp; Without talents, there is no
self.&nbsp; Talents are fundamentally different from land.&nbsp; The
equal rights of all to land can consistently be asserted while still
asserting that every person has right to the use of his or her talents.</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html">Read

<p>Winston Churchill: <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">The
People's Land</a>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
  differs from all
  other forms of property.</span>&nbsp; It is quite true that the land
  monopoly is not the only monopoly which
  exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies -- is a perpetual
  monopoly, and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. It is
  quite true that unearned increments in land are not the only form of
  unearned or undeserved profit which individuals are able to secure; but
  it is the principal form of unearned increment which is derived from
  processes which are not merely not beneficial, but which are positively
  detrimental to the general public. Land, which is a necessity of human
  existence, which is the original source of all wealth, which is
  strictly limited in extent, which is fixed in geographical position --
  land, I say, differs from all other forms of property in these primary
  and fundamental conditions. Nothing is more amusing than to watch the
  efforts of our monopolist opponents to prove that other forms of
  property and increment are exactly the same and are similar in all
  respects to the unearned increment in land. They talk to us of the
  increased profits of a doctor or a lawyer from the growth of population
  in the towns in which they live. They talk to us of the profits of a
  railway through a greater degree of wealth and activity in the
  districts through which it runs. They tell us of the profits which are
  derived from a rise in stocks and shares, and even of those which are
  sometimes derived from the sale of pictures and works of art, and they
  ask us, as if it were the only complaint, 'Ought not all these other
  forms to be taxed too?'</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misleading
  analogies. </span>But see how misleading and false all these analogies
  are. The windfalls
  which people with artistic gifts are able from time to time to derive
  from the sale of a picture -- from a Vandyke or a Holbein -- may here
  and there be very considerable. But Pictures do not get in anybody's
  way. They do not lay a toll on anybody's labour; they do not touch
  enterprise and production at any point; they do not affect any of the
  creative processes upon which the material well-being of millions
  depends; and if a rise in stocks and shares confers profits on the
  fortunate holders far beyond what they expected, or indeed, deserved,
  nevertheless, that profit has not been reaped by withholding from the
  community the land which it needs, but, on the contrary, apart from
  mere gambling, it has been reaped by supplying industry with the
  capital without which it could not be carried on. If the railway makes
  greater profits, it is usually because it carries more goods and more
  passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a better practice, it is
  because the doctor attends more patients and more exacting patients,
  and because the lawyer pleads more suits in the courts and more
  important suits. At every stage the doctor or the lawyer is giving
  service in return for his fees, and if the service is too poor or the
  fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can come freely into
  competition. There is constant service, there is constant competition;
  there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the public interest, there
  is no impediment to the general progress.</small></p>
  <p><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned
    increment </span>Fancy comparing these healthy processes with the
    enrichment which comes
    to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or
    at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy
    population around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient,
    more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway
    services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric
    trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a
    hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all the while the landlord
    sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour
    and at the cost of other people.</span> Many of the most important are
    effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To not one of those improvements does the
    land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
    of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</span> He renders
    no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
    welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
    enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
    dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
    in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
    undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
    -- ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
    the unearned increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be
    diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
    office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
    tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
    developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
    its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
    place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
    ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
    competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
    world -- both in time and money. And all the while the land monopolist
    has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
    in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
    his part; and that is justice! ... <a
