and Women's Employment</span></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The hours of paid work per family per year has risen significantly in recent
    decades as married women entered the workplace in large numbers. As Elizabeth
  Warren and Amelia Tyagi have noted in <em>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class
    Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke</em> (2003), a typical two-income
    couple today has
    less disposable income, after paying their fixed costs, than a single-income
  couple a generation ago!  </p>
  <p>Just as "population pressure is bound
    to increase the value of urban land," so is the additional income
  generated by the large-scale entry of women into the workplace.&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>But if we had had an adequate system of land taxation, we could have
    prevented the steep rise in urban land <em>prices</em> which robs families who need
    places to live and enriches those rich enough and foresighted enough to own
    well-located
    land.&nbsp;  And had we had LVT in place, the families of those women would
    have reaped far more of the economic benefit of the hours of paid work they
    undertake.</p>
  <p>What sort of economy do we want to leave for our children and grandchildren?
    One in which the landholders reap the benefits, or those who labor get the
    benefits? One in which affordable housing is available, or one in which young
    people must pay others a huge amount in order to have a place to live? One
    in which one pays the landlord or seller and then also pays taxes, or one
    in which the locational  portion of what one pays to the landlord is passed
    along to the commons as the basis for our common spending? One in which people
    must borrow to the hilt to afford a home within commuting distance of well-paid
    work, or one in which a single salary is enough to support a family while
    children are young so that couples have a real choice about whether both
    partners work full-time?<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every
      form of enterprise only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed
      the cream off for himself&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does not matter where you
      look or what examples you select, you will see that every form of enterprise,
      every step in material progress, is only undertaken after the land monopolist
      has skimmed the cream off for himself, and everywhere today the man or
      the public body who wishes to put land to its highest use is forced to
      pay a preliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an
      inferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. All comes back to the
      land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his toll upon
      all other forms of wealth and upon every form of industry. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A portion, in some cases the whole, of every benefit
      which is laboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land
      value, and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket.</span> <strong><em>If
      there is a rise in wages, rents are able to move forward, because the workers
      can afford to pay a little more.</em></strong> If the opening of a new railway or a new
      tramway or the institution of an improved service of workmen's trains or
      a lowering of fares or a new invention or any other public convenience
      affords a benefit to the workers in any particular district, <em><strong>it
      becomes easier for them to live, and therefore the landlord and the ground
      landlord, one on top of the other, are able to charge them more for the
      privilege
      of living there.</strong></em> <strong>...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now let the Manchester Ship Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
  a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its story about
  Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the first thing that had
  to be done was to buy the land. Before the resolution to build the Canal was
  taken, the land on which the Canal flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands'
  -- was, in the main, agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from
  30s. to L2 an acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within
  that description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether. Immediately
  after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000 sterling -- or an
  average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or six times the agricultural
  value of the land and the value on which it had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now what had the landowner done for
  the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he rendered;
  what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this enormous multiplication
  of the value of his property! I will tell you in one word what he had done.
  Can you guess it! Nothing.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for making
  the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land either
  having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose rapidly, and splendidly,
  in value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By the stroke of a fairy wand, without
  toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many landowners in Salford,
  Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn, etc., found themselves in possession
  of property which had trebled, quadrupled, quintupled in value.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy bill for
  compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no land
  was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not taken many times
  in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost of construction. All
  this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and capital created this great
  public work. Much of this land today is still rated at ordinary agricultural
  value, and in order to make sure that no injustice is done, in order to make
  quite certain that these landowners are not injured by our system of government,
  half their rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them.
  The balance is made up by you. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The land is
  still rising in value, and with every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood
  does and with every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement
  of this great city, the land is further enhanced in value. </span>... <a

  Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a> (circa 1964)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let
us now turn to that part of the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage. <small><small><big><big><a
