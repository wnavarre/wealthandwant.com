Tax</span>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The property tax is actually two taxes with very different effects and
  incentives.&nbsp; The tax on land values has very positive incentives:
  raise it, and good things start to happen.&nbsp; The tax on building
  values has very negative incentives: raise it, and bad things start to
  happen.&nbsp; Most municipalities have the same millage rate on land
  and buildings, so an increase in the property tax has very mixed
  incentives -- no wonder it is often considered the most hated
  tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alternative is to uncouple the two pieces of the
  property tax.&nbsp; Let the millage rate on buildings fall.&nbsp; Let
  the millage rate on land rise.&nbsp; This reduces the perverse
  incentives and increases the desirable incentives. (It isn't the whole
  story; there are still other perverse tax incentives to be considered,
  such as taxes on work and taxes on sales.)</p>

Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on
the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The property tax,
rather than "shoot anything that
moves," is a charge on inactivity.</span></b> It taxes both lands and
buildings on their market value, regardless of how they are used.
"Hold on," you might say, "how about the very activity of
constructing those buildings?" Yes, touch&eacute;, the property tax
does shoot at that, and shoot hard. However,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> that is why we are here
today, to consider modifying the tax to exempt buildings. </span>The
proposal is to make it a tax mainly, or even purely, on "land ex
buildings," a tax on inactivity, a tax just for sitting on a piece
carved from the world's fixed, limited land supply.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Biases and
Reforms</a></small></small><b><br>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><small>Priority #1.
Safeguarding the property tax</small></b></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We need to uphold and safeguard
the property tax as the mainstay
of state and local finance. Remember, it is partly a tax on land
value. It is the institutional basis for much of the Georgist goal.
We speak of reforming the property tax, but first there must be a
property tax. Because it exists, we can modify it to tap land rent
for public uses in a non-catastrophic way, using traditional laws,
administrative agencies, and land tenures. Capping the property tax
rate, as in California, ties the hands of reformers.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There has been much ado about
Hawaii's phased-in shift to a
two-rate property tax plan. However, Hawaii raises only 16% of its
state and local revenues from the property tax, so the rate is very
low. You can focus the Hawaiian property tax on land values 100%, and
still have an 84%-messed-up tax system. Studies would then show
little visible result from the reform. Critics would say "Ho-hum, we
told you so."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>New Hampshire is another story. It
raises 64% of its state and
local revenues from the property tax, double the U.S. mean of 32%.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Hampshire is called a "low-tax"
state, but its property tax is
highest in the nation, per capita, at $1344. The U.S. mean is $699 pc
(per capita), and it goes down to $174 pc in Alabama.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Politicians whose priority is
raising sales taxes for property tax
relief might study Alabama's economy overall, and ask if that is the
model they aspire to. Its per capita income ranks 41st in the U.S.
Meantime,
New Hampshire's marshy peneplains, barren granites, icy winters, and
impassable mountains are producing the 7th highest per capita income in
the
nation.</small></p>

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CG-E.html">California's
Governor-Elect</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For better or worse, California
has recalled its governor and
elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His choice of advisors, however,
tells us A.S. will repeat Pete
Wilson's performance from the early 1990s. Chief of Staff Patricia
Clarey is a good soldier from Wilson's old staff; Auditor Donna
Arduin is from Jeb Bush's Florida. The gurus who set the doctrinal
tone give the clearest hints: they are neo-classical economists of
deepest dye. These are advisors George Shultz and Michael Boskin
from the Hoover Institution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economics,
to them, is a set of dismal
choices. California's choice is to cut public services, or lose
business and jobs. That is what they told Wilson in 1994. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">All taxes
are the same, always "burdens," always driving away "business."</span></span>&nbsp;
...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Boskin and Shultz, posing their
dismal choice for California,
dismissed by silence that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
can raise needed revenues while also
spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is also alleged that land
values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turnover of costlier homes is
lower than that of ordinary homes. (For example, turnover of existing
homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2million = $1.5 trillions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are not large buildings:
they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone
is over $1m. They are not new buildings: only 9% are new. It's the
land that makes them worth so much.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax of 1% on that value would
yield $15 billions a year.</span> </b>
That's from only 2.7% of the urban homes in Calif. The data exclude
many sales, country manors, for example. Some well-known lands thus
excluded are </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the Lucas compound and the Pritzker family compound in
Marin; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>San Simeon; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Reagan Ranch and similar holdings in the
northern half of Sta. Barbara Cnty; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>fashionable winery properties in
choice valleys statewide; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Chandler family's Tejon Ranch; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the
200,000 acres of James Boswell in the Tulare Lake Basin; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is also the other 97.3%
of urban owner-occupied
residential real estate.</b> A lot of it is just under $1 million a
pop. In Marin County, the <span style="font-style: italic;">median </span>sales
price of owner-occupied
single-family homes was $700,000 when last seen, and rising. The
mean is always higher than the median. Some L.A. County cities with
median values just under $1 million include San Marino, Bel Air,
Westwood, Brentwood, La Canada, Calabasas, and others. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is also
all the other land: commercial, industrial, farm, forest, etc., which
is 60% of the assessed property value in California, and a much
higher fraction of the real value because it is so egregiously
underassessed. ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A high fraction of California real estate is absentee owned.
</b> The Sultan of Brunei, for example, owns several houses and sites
in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. California's official Legislative
Analyst, the highly respected William Hamm, estimated <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">in 1978 that
over fifty per cent of the value of taxable property in California
was absentee-owned.</span> ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Some half of any reduction in California property taxes leaks
to out-of-state owners. </b> Nor is this the only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">leakage</span>. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Yet no one has seized on this
obvious case to show that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">local property taxes, substituted
for
absentee rent payments, creates multiple increases in local income.</span>
The whole intellectual apparatus is dominated by absentee investors
and used for their benefit.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span

license, rather than
title, and escape the property tax almost entirely. ... </span><a

slashes its property tax?</small>
</a><br>
</small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Michiganders are saying they must
wait and see, but there is no
need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To
read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened
since California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The private sector is doing badly, too.</b> Raising income
taxes, business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an
economy; they are all a drag on work and enterprise. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about
it, the expectable result of what the voters did.</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They turned property from a functional concept into a
sacred one; from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce
goods, and pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small></li>
  <li><small>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in
favor of the rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The predictable result is to
inhibit economic activity, and
encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</small><br>
<br>
<small>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of
Prop.
13 as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the
social compact." <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in
L.A., 1945-50. </b>These were small, creative, flexible, and too
varied to classify. No Linnaeus could sort them in conventional
categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here and started
producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
and others never seen before.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why is that not happening
today, 1995?</b> An invisible,
pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible to
hold land at negligible tax cost. In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every
year, building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. Today
that same tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of
Thumb</b> (see below under B,1), it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1%
applied to 1/8 of the true value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landowners are only taxed now
if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they meet the drag of our
high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated by the
fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us
segue from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a
third-world economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little
relief in sight. ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing
growth up to 1978, and the resilience
to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945 and still grow
"explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we have a string of
reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis, plus
various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The regressive property tax"
has become a common block phrase
among economists and in the popular press. President Nixon's support
for revenue-sharing is increasingly based on the need to protect the
poor from heavy property taxes. Some prominent tax economists are
favoring even sales taxes to make the tax system more progressive, by
lowering the property tax. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(1)</i></b></small></font>
Even local income taxes, which are mainly payroll taxes, are being
advanced to relieve property and the poor.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I find this implausible. To own
property is to be rich, in the
measure that one owns, and to tax the quality of richness should not
be presumed to burden the poor more than the rich. As to the
elderly, it is only traditional for interest groups to hide behind
selected widows, and one should rarely take such appeals at face
value. And so I propose critically to examine the bases for alleging
the property tax to be regressive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Founding Fathers regarded
property taxes as redistributive and
equalitarian. James Madison wrote:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In England, at this day,
if elections were open to all
classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be unsure.

these invaluable interests, . . . . They ought to be so constituted as
to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.<font

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Madison also wrote ". . . the
most common and durable source of

to reduce the incentives for

which promotes a "leap frog" development out of the city and into the
surrounding countryside, would decrease. The proposed shift from
traditional property tax to a "land value tax" would penalize land
speculation and encourage urban redevelopment. Removing the tax on
buildings makes them cheaper to construct, renovate and operate, and
more affordable to buy or rent. Urban construction creates urban
jobs. Capital and labor both benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <a
