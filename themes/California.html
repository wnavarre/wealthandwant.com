<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">What
    the Railroad Will Bring Us</a> [Californians, and particularly San
    Franciscans]&nbsp; (1868)<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">  </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>UPON the plains this season
railroad building is progressing with a rapidity never before known.
The two companies, in their struggle for the enormous bounty offered by
the Government, are shortening the distance between the lines of rail
at the rate of from seven to nine miles a day -- almost as fast as the
ox teams which furnished the primitive method of conveyance across the
continent could travel. Possibly by the middle of next spring, and
certainly, we are told, before mid-summer comes again, this "greatest
work of the age" will be completed, and an unbroken track stretch from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is the railroad to do for <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span>?
-- this railroad that we have
looked for, hoped for, prayed for so long? ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>For years the high rate of interest and the high rate of wages
prevailing in California have been special subjects for the
lamentation of a certain school of local political economists, who
could not see that high wages and high interest were indications that
the natural wealth of the country was not yet monopolized, that great
opportunities were open to all -- who did not know that these were
evidences of social health, and that it were as wise to lament them
as for the maiden to wish to exchange the natural bloom on her cheek
for the interesting pallor of the invalid? </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But however this be, it is
certain that the tendency of the new era -- the more dense population
and more thorough development of the wealth of the State -- will be
to a reduction both of the rate of interest and the rate of wages,
particularly the latter. This tendency may not, probably will not, be
shown immediately; but it will be before long, and that powerfully,
unless balanced and counteracted by other influences which we are not
now considering, which do not yet appear, and which it is probable
will not appear for some time yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
truth is, that the completion of the railroad and the
consequent great increase of business and population, will not be a
benefit to all of us, but only to a portion.</span> As a general rule
(liable of course to exceptions) those who <span
 style="font-style: italic;">have</span> it will make
wealthier; for those who <span style="font-style: italic;">have not</span>,
it will make it more difficult to
get. Those who have lands, mines, established businesses, special
abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; those who have only their own labor will be
come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first, because it will
take more capital to buy land or to get into business; and second,
because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this capital will
be harder for them to obtain.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so in San Francisco the rise
in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for
rent; means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies
courts, slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">San
Francisco has one great advantage -- there is probably a
larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
lots than in any other city of the United States.</span> The product of
the
rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the
great social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship
cannot be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the
princely domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">pueblo </span>was not appropriated
to furnishing free, or almost free,
homesteads to actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into
the hands of a few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been
taken up in time and in a proper spirit, this disposition might
easily have been secured, and the great city of the future would have
had a population bound to her by the strongest ties -- a population
better, freer, more virtuous, independent and public spirited than
any great city the world has ever had.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To say that "Power is
constantly stealing from the many to the
few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends to
concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the
new era into which California is entering, its operations will be
more marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great
centralizer. It kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the
same way kills little businesses and builds up great ones. We have
had comparatively but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning
"very rich" has in these times. But the process is going on. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
great city that is to be will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts
and Spragues, and he who looks a few years ahead may even now read
their names as he passes along Montgomery, California or Front
streets.&nbsp;</span> With the protection which property gets in modern
times -- with stocks, bonds, burglar-proof safes and policemen; with
the
railroad and the telegraph, after a man gets a certain amount of money
it is plain sailing, and he need take no risks. Astor said that to
get his first thousand dollars was his toughest struggle; but when
one gets a million, if he has ordinary prudence, how much he will
have is only a question of life. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nor
can we rely on the absence of
laws of primogeniture and entail to dissipate these large fortunes so
menacing to the general weal. Any large fortune will, of course,
become dissipated in time, even in spite of laws of primogeniture and
entail; but every aggregation of wealth implies and necessitates
others, and so that the aggregations remain, it matters little in
what particular hands. </span>Stewart, in the natural course of
things, will
die before long, and being childless, his wealth will be dissipated,
or at least go out of the dry goods business. But will this avail the
smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing out? Not at all.
Some one else will step in, take his place in the trade, and run the
great money-making machine which he has organized, or some other
similar one. Stewart and other great houses have concentrated the
business, and
it will remain concentrated. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes
to the effects of this concentration of wealth. One millionaire
involves the little existence of just so many proletarians. It is the
great tree and the saplings over again. We need not look far from the
palace to find the hovel. When people can charter special steamboats
to take them to watering places, pay four thousand dollars for the
summer rental of a cottage, build marble stables for their horses,
and give dinner parties which cost by the thousand dollars a head, we
may know that there are poor girls on the streets pondering between
starvation and dishonor.&nbsp; When liveries appear, look out for
bare-footed children. A few
liveries are now to be seen on our streets; we think their appearance
coincides in date with the establishment of the almshouse. They are
few, plain and modest now; they will grow more numerous and gaudy --
and then we will not wait long for the children -- their
corollaries. ...<a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Massed control of land is the
most
natural base for monopolizing
markets because land is limited.&nbsp; Buying land always does double
duty: when A expands he <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>
preempts opportunities from B. For
example, a chain of service stations with most of the best comers in a
town has market power, the more so if it also holds a large share of
oil
sources, of refinery sites, of "offset rights" to pollute air,
transmission rights of way, harbor sites, and other such limited
lands.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Preemption is not always just a by-product of expansion; it may
be the
main point.&nbsp; For example, in 1993 Builders'
Emporium, a large chain of California hardware stores with large
parking
lots in good locations, closed down and sold out.&nbsp; The sites were
bought up by the largest grocery chain in southern California, Vons
Company.&nbsp; According to news reports, this is "a shut-out strategy
against competitors."&nbsp; Vons will convert 6-8 Emporium stores to
Vons' markets, and "hold onto the others until commercial rents rebound
-- then market them to non-rivals."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Salomon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler, far from being shocked,
praises
this as "ingenious."&nbsp; "You're controlling who's in your market
area."&nbsp; Ralphs, another grocery chain, had been looking for sites
and is now shut out.&nbsp; The stores
remain empty today; the land idle.&nbsp; <a

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_WHWASRSIPT.html"><small>What happens when a state radically
slashes its property tax?</small>
</a><br>
</small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Michiganders are saying they must
wait and see, but there is no
need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To
read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened
since California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The private sector is doing badly, too.</b> Raising income
taxes, business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an
economy; they are all a drag on work and enterprise.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about
it, the expectable result of what the voters did.</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They turned property from a functional concept into a
sacred one; from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce
goods, and pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small></li>
  <li><small>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in
favor of the rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The predictable result is to
inhibit economic activity, and
encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</small><br>
<br>
<small>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of
Prop.
13 as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the
social compact."<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in
L.A., 1945-50. </b>These were small, creative, flexible, and too
varied to classify. No Linnaeus could sort them in conventional
categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here and started
producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
and others never seen before.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why is that not happening
today, 1995?</b> An invisible,
pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible to
hold land at negligible tax cost. In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every
year, building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. Today
that same tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of
Thumb</b> (see below under B,1), it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1%
applied to 1/8 of the true value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landowners are only taxed now
if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they meet the drag of our
high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated by the
fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us
segue from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a
third-world economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little
relief in sight. ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing
growth up to 1978, and the resilience
to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945 and still grow
"explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we have a string of
reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis, plus
various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CG-E.html">California's
Governor-Elect</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For better or worse, California
has recalled its governor and
elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His choice of advisors, however,
tells us A.S. will repeat Pete
Wilson's performance from the early 1990s. Chief of Staff Patricia
Clarey is a good soldier from Wilson's old staff; Auditor Donna
Arduin is from Jeb Bush's Florida. The gurus who set the doctrinal
tone give the clearest hints: they are neo-classical economists of
deepest dye. These are advisors George Shultz and Michael Boskin
from the Hoover Institution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economics,
to them, is a set of dismal
choices. California's choice is to cut public services, or lose
business and jobs. That is what they told Wilson in 1994. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">All taxes
are the same, always "burdens," always driving away "business."</span></span>&nbsp;
...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Boskin and Shultz, posing their
dismal choice for California,
dismissed by silence that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
can raise needed revenues while also
spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings.</span>.&nbsp; <strong>....</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is also alleged that land
values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turnover of costlier homes is
lower than that of ordinary homes. (For example, turnover of existing
homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2million = $1.5 trillions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are not large buildings:
they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone
is over $1m. They are not new buildings: only 9% are new. It's the
land that makes them worth so much.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax of 1% on that value would
yield $15 billions a year.</span> </b>
That's from only 2.7% of the urban homes in Calif. The data exclude
many sales, country manors, for example. Some well-known lands thus
excluded are </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the Lucas compound and the Pritzker family compound in
Marin; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>San Simeon; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Reagan Ranch and similar holdings in the
northern half of Sta. Barbara Cnty; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>fashionable winery properties in
choice valleys statewide; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Chandler family's Tejon Ranch; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the
200,000 acres of James Boswell in the Tulare Lake Basin; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is also the other 97.3%
of urban owner-occupied
residential real estate.</b> A lot of it is just under $1 million a
pop. In Marin County, the <span style="font-style: italic;">median </span>sales
price of owner-occupied
single-family homes was $700,000 when last seen, and rising. The
mean is always higher than the median. Some L.A. County cities with
median values just under $1 million include San Marino, Bel Air,
Westwood, Brentwood, La Canada, Calabasas, and others. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is also
all the other land: commercial, industrial, farm, forest, etc., which
is 60% of the assessed property value in California, and a much
higher fraction of the real value because it is so egregiously
underassessed. ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A high fraction of California real estate is absentee owned.
</b> The Sultan of Brunei, for example, owns several houses and sites
in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. California's official Legislative
Analyst, the highly respected William Hamm, estimated <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">in 1978 that
over fifty per cent of the value of taxable property in California
was absentee-owned.</span> <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Some half of any reduction in California property taxes leaks
to out-of-state owners. </b> Nor is this the only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">leakage</span>. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Yet no one has seized on this
obvious case to show that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">local property taxes, substituted
for
absentee rent payments, creates multiple increases in local income.</span>
The whole intellectual apparatus is dominated by absentee investors
and used for their benefit.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Many valuable land resources are held by
license, rather than
title, and escape the property tax almost entirely. ... </span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What would happen in California
if we eliminated the sales tax,
and replaced it by raising the property tax?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. No catastrophe </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Five states and the Province of
Alberta already get along nicely
with no sales tax, so it must be possible. No state at all had a
retail sales tax before 1929 (GA). 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>California opened its gates in
1933 with the Riley-Stuart Act, and so did several other states. It
was sold as an "emergency measure," at a rate of 2%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>As late as 1977
it was 4.75%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Now it is 7.25% statewide, with many cities, counties
and transportation districts adding their tolls to the total, but for
most of our state's existence we got along nicely with either no
sales tax, or much lower rates than today. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Property Tax rate
would rise to a level lower than it was
before Prop. 13.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assessed Value
(A.V.)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of taxable
property. Add that to the
current 1%, and get 2.19%, compared to 2.7% before Prop. 13 - except
that the 2.7% was applied to actual value, while today's assessed
valuations are far below that. </span></small></div>
<small> </small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The A.V. value of land is probably
about 1/3 or so of market
value; buildings are closer to market.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Greater
equity:&nbsp; </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">The distribution of
the tax burden would
shift from poor counties
to richer ones. </span></small><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Thus, in the poor inland counties of Fresno, Tulare,
Imperial, and Stanislaus, sales tax revenues are about 1.5% of A.V.s. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In rich coastal and suburban counties of Sta. Barbara and
Marin,
sales tax revenues are about .75% of A.V.s. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the state sales tax
takes a lot more money from the poor counties than it would cost them
to replace the services from local taxes; the rich counties, with the
high property tax bases, are contributing less to the common pool
than they are saving in property taxes.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, by extension and
analogy, I am reasonably certain
that a careful study will show that the burden would shift from
poorer cities and districts to richer ones. Again, among individuals,
I believe we would find the same. One of these days, God willing, I
will find the time and money to conduct or sponsor such a study. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The relevance here of this equity
question is that most states and
provinces have complex and expensive systems and formulae for "power
equalization," and the like, designed to shift resources from rich
counties to poorer ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
reason such programs are needed is to
offset the effects of the very same state sales taxes used to finance
them.</span> There are great savings to be realized by quashing this
cross-hauling of public funds.&nbsp; </small><small><small

 href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html"><small>The
Partiality of Indexing Capital
Gains</small></a><big> (1990)</big></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now we are witnessing a major
effort to revive the exclusion
of part or all of capital gains from taxable income, partly on the
grounds that much of the gains are "phantom" income, an illusion of
inflation. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not
formed, like capital, by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls). <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ignoring land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses. ///</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... most of us resident in
California have been through one or more years since 1976 when the
value of our homes alone rose by more than our annual salaries. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>We are not pushing for a general wealth tax, but for
impartiality and accurate thinking about indexing capital gains, a
policy that would protect some forms of wealth, but not others. This
apparently temperate, common-sense proposal is in fact partial and
discriminatory. Worse, it protects most where the macro-social
benefits are least.</small><font><small><small><small><small><a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_2RiR.html">Two-Rate in Reverse</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
He carried a new law that let tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value.<strong> ...</strong><br>
<small><br>
</small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong><small><br>
</small></small>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100 years ago, American
Georgists made a big point that city land
outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hearst </span>palace
at San Simeon sits amid
82,000 manorial acres, including miles of prime shoreline, "improved"
with just one home per 82,000 acres. This home, jammed with imported
treasures, had become a white elephant even before Citizen Kane
uttered his final "Rosebud."<span style="font-style: italic;"> The
heirs were glad to fob it off onto
the taxpayers of California, deducting its alleged value from their
taxable incomes, while they kept the 82,000 acres.</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span

</ul>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">those
are a few of the struggling family
farmers whom use-value assessment of farmland saves from destitution.</span></small>
<p><small>The privilege of use-value assessment stretches even beyond
farmlands, vast as they are. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland
</span>in most states gets the
same preferred treatment, only better. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">About 1/3 of
the privately
owned land in the U.S. is in timber. </span>In California, owners
(mostly
huge corporations) may put the land into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"TPZ"</span> class. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
all declared "compatible" with timber,
hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.&nbsp; </span></span></small><small

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>About a 100 years ago, California adopted the
land tax for a while. The
legislature allowed irrigation districts to fund dam and canal
construction by taxing the resultant rise in land value. This
legislation was the fruit of the effort of one legislator, C. Wright,
who left teaching school to run for office, pass his bill, then
returned to teaching. As voters, farmers were beginning to have more
representation than rich ranchers. Then the idea of a Single Tax on
land values, made popular by writer <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry
George</a>, was current.
Unfortunately, once the irrigation improvements were paid for, the land
tax was allowed to languish, as speculators regained political control.
<strong>...</strong></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A century ago, many farmers and miners went
without water because cattlemen like Henry Miller owned 1,000,000 acres
in California. Miller could drive his herds from Mexico to Oregon and
spend every night on his own land. In 1886 Mill won full rights to the
water of the Kern River. To correct this aggrandizement, the state
allowed communities to create by popular vote irrigation districts to
build dams and canals and pay for them by taxing the increase in land
value. Once irrigated, land was too valuable to use for grazing, and
the tax made it too costly for hoarding. So cattlemen sold off fields
to farmers and at prices the farmers could afford. In ten years, the
land rent tax turned the Central Valley into over 7,000 independent
farms. Over the next decades, those treeless, semi-arid plains became
the garden of America.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Some states permit localities or their voters to
establish <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assessment
districts</span> to fund a particular service such as beautification.
Some
states direct their ADs to collect only the rise in ground rent; others
define assessment charges similar to property taxes, falling on the
combined value of sites and structures. In some states, assessment
charges fall within limitations upon taxes; in other states they don't.
The ideal state for setting up ADs in place of the property tax may be
California whose Prop 13 severely curtailed the property tax yet whose
Supreme Court has given ADs pretty much free reign.</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a
