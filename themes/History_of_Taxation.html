of Taxation</span><br>

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">George's
Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices
with practical resolutions and synergies</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist policy can be applied at
any level: local, state, or
national. To some extent it is even applied at a world level,
through the U.N., with its concept of "common heritage" applied to
oceanic resources of the deep seabeds. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax policy can also be
applied at any tax rate, low or
high. A low rate does a little good; a high rate does a lot of
good.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this Century, strenuous efforts
have been made to box the
property tax into the local level, where local particularism tends to
cap the rate. In England, this policy is identified with the
half-brothers, Austen and Neville Chamberlain. Neville was so
successful that in 1938 he was forced to face Adolf Hitler without
any armed support, with the disaster at Munich. In America the
Federal government last taxed land in the Georgist manner during the
Civil War. After 1913 it taxed the income from land, but in recent
years the income tax has degenerated into a payroll tax primarily. In
tandem with the other payroll tax it has become a primary cause of
our depressed labor market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1920, about half of all <b>state</b>
revenues (not counting
local) came from state property taxes. These tended to focus on
land, rather than capital, much more than now. Both the state and
Federal governments could tax land again, any time the voters send
that message.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a

<p>Mason Gaffney: <small> <small><a

e-commerce</a></small><font size="+1"><small></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
writers and reporters in this new field accept state and
local sales taxes as part of the ordained order of things.</span> The
predominant attitude is one of how to preserve and raise the state
sales tax, by taxing purchases from "foreign" (out-of-state)
sources, which are regarded as an administrative nuisance and a
leakage.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
textbooks on public finance do not treat the general retail
sales tax as the historical novelty that it is. They no longer
mention that no state taxed retail sales until 1929 (GA) and 1930
(MS), and most not until 1933 (when California joined the movement
with a rate of 2%) and the mid-thirties, by which time half the
states joined in. Few books give any weight to the fact that 5 states
and one province (Alberta) have no sales tax at all: the states are
Alaska, Oregon, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Montana. </span>The
academics
treat these states as eccentrics and laggards, and trivialize them
for their small populations, but the states in question, which have
10 U.S. Senators among them, do not see themselves that way at all.

</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of them, Oregon, in 1980
retired the powerful Chairman of the
House Committee on Ways and Means, Al Ullman, because he championed a
Federal VAT. </small><br>
<small> </small><br>
<small>Another, New Hampshire, plays a key role in screening
presidential candidates. It is rather a matter of some local pride,
not to mention commercial advantage. </small><br>
<small> </small><br>
<small>People speak casually about a
uniform Federal standard for all states (and all cities and counties
within states, over 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in all). But state
taxes are a power reserved to each state; not one they will quietly
abandon.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Few academics show much concern
about the sales tax's partiality
and non-uniformity. They enumerate a few exemptions, but then favor
it because it allegedly exempts capital formation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... I am here to explore how
e-commerce
may work as a lever to lower or quash sales taxes, and to show how
states may do that without making catastrophic quakes or waves. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The Commerce Clause has
preserved interstate tax competition.
Without it, it is likely that state sales taxes would rise to 20% or
more in short order, as the wholesome fear of interstate competition
was stifled. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It created and has
preserved our domestic market, the
greatest free trade zone in the world, an essential ingredient of
American productivity and prosperity. It is not something to be
thrown away lightly, especially not for the sake of something as
baneful as the retail sales tax.</span>&nbsp; .<strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would happen in California if we eliminated the sales tax,
and replaced it by raising the property tax?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. No
catastrophe&nbsp; </b>Five
states and the Province of Alberta already get along nicely
with no sales tax, so it must be possible. No state at all had a
retail sales tax before 1929 (GA).<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California opened its gates in
1933 with the Riley-Stuart Act, and so did several other states. 
</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>It
was sold as an "emergency measure," at a rate of 2%.</small></li>
  <li><small>As late as 1977
it was 4.75%.</small></li>
  <li><small>Now it is 7.25% statewide, with many cities, counties
and transportation districts adding their tolls to the total, but for
most of our state's existence we got along nicely with either no
sales tax, or much lower rates than today. </small></li>
</ul>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
Property Tax rate would rise to a level lower than it was
before Prop. 13.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assessed Value
(A.V.)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of taxable
property. Add that to the
current 1%, and get 2.19%, compared to 2.7% before Prop. 13 - except
that the 2.7% was applied to actual value, while today's assessed
valuations are far below that. </span></small> California sales tax
revenues are currently 1.19% of
the </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The A.V. value of land is probably
about 1/3 or so of market
value; buildings are closer to market.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Greater
equity:&nbsp; </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">The distribution of
the tax burden would
shift from poor counties
to richer ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></small><small>Thus, </small><ul>
  <li><small>in the poor inland counties of Fresno, Tulare,
Imperial, and Stanislaus, sales tax revenues are about 1.5% of A.V.s. </small></li>
  <li><small>In rich coastal and suburban counties of Sta. Barbara
and Marin,
sales tax revenues are about .75% of A.V.s. </small></li>
</ul>
</div>
<small> </small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the state sales tax
takes a lot more money from the poor counties than it would cost them
to replace the services from local taxes; the rich counties, with the
high property tax bases, are contributing less to the common pool
than they are saving in property taxes.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, by extension and
analogy, I am reasonably certain
that a careful study will show that the burden would shift from
poorer cities and districts to richer ones. Again, among individuals,
I believe we would find the same. One of these days, God willing, I
will find the time and money to conduct or sponsor such a study. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The relevance here of this
equity question is that most states and
provinces have complex and expensive systems and formulae for "power
equalization," and the like, designed to shift resources from rich
counties to poorer ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
reason such programs are needed is to
offset the effects of the very same state sales taxes used to finance
them.</span> There are great savings to be realized by quashing this
cross-hauling of public funds. </small> <small><a

"Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tax experts, especially at the
state level, ply their
trade by invoking one metaphor above all others: the three-legged
stool.&nbsp; It rests on the claim that a sound and successful tax
regime for any government needs to rely on a three tax bases: income,
property and sales.&nbsp; This is repeated so often that it passes
today without much examination.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The power with
which the three-legged stool analogy has underpinned tax policy is in
fact rather disconcerting, because a close examination of its premises
shows that they are very questionable.&nbsp;</span> These benchmark
measures of a tax regime are scrutinized here in order to cast doubt on
the claims so often made on their behalf. <span

is a Progressive Tax</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karl Williams:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Williams_ImK.html">Social Justice In
Australia: INTERMEDIATE KIT</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">There's a simple rule of
thumb which will guide us here - taxes on land (in its wider sense of
natural resources) are desirable and do not inhibit wages or
production, and taxes on labour and capital punish both. Remember this
catchy little slogan? - pay for what you take, not what you make.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE'S ROBIN HOOD WHEN YOU
NEED HIM?</span></small><br>
<small>The history of taxation reveals that taxation has increasingly
been
diverted from land to capital to today's mixture of capital and labour.
Fascinating studies have shown that the prosperity of the average
English labourer with a family of five actually peaked around 1495.
This was the age of "Merrie England" when taxes were almost entirely on
land, and land prices were low. But then the infamous enclosures of the
commons accelerated, with land taxes increasingly being replaced by
taxes on capital and labour. In 1495, the wages of the average English
labourer were around 2.9 times the cost of living, but this relatively
affluent state was rapidly turned around as taxes were shifted off
land. By the mid 1600's wages were almost down to the breadline as
common land had been almost entirely enclosed by the Crown and the
"nobility."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Other examples of the destructive power of taxation abound. In
the
Middle Ages, merchants and the emerging middle class were slugged.
Duties were levied on traded goods everywhere, stifling trade and
enterprise and giving rise to the inefficiencies of smuggling and
organised crime. Wealth taxes in France were based on the number of
windows in a person's house, resulting in houses being boarded up. The
same taxes were imposed in the Arab world on the number of palm trees
that a person owned - you can guess the result.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A MEDIEVAL MENTALITY</span></small><br>
<small>Before we modern, educated citizens start chuckling too loudly
at our
forebears, we should look at our own tax system. What does the GST do
to sales (and, by implication, production and employment)? How is a
person's motivation to work affected by income taxes? What effect do
payroll taxes have on the number of people on the payroll?</small><br>
<br>
<small>But the right taxes can have constructive results. The reason
why some
Geonomists advocate taxes on social undesirables such as tobacco and
alcohol is because they are not really arbitrary taxes, but an attempt
make people who choose to abuse their health pay for their future
health costs. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
