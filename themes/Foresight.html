  <p>What should we reward?

            to privatize the economic value our land and other natural resources
            for their own benefit, or for their own children or
            great-great

        the treatment of the land and natural resources as our common treasure?</p>
  <p>Should the great-grandchildren of the landed start life
            with more than the great-grandchildren of those who had no land? Georgists
            seek to create a level playing field on which both groups have equal
            access to all natural opportunities, and all have the incentives
            to excel. <br>
          </span><br>
          To the extent that foresight consists of being able to envision
                a city where a town is now, and having enough money to buy land
                there, foresight does not create anything useful for society.
                We shouldn't
                be rewarding land speculation. Rather, we should be rewarding
                those who create jobs, those who create housing, those who create
                from
                our natural resources, not making it possible for those with &quot;foresight&quot; to
                get there first and be permitted to charge those creators for
        access to the land!</p>

  <p>... But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
      to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about
      the law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of
      land as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it
      till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
        paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
        paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
        paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
        mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
        by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
        and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
        from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
        value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
        owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.</strong>    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    <strong>forethought</strong> may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p><strong>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach
      to things provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot
      attach to things provided by the reason and forethought of God!</strong></p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
    new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
    never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
    the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the Bishop of
    Meath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
