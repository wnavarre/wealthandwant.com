    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
    is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This
    is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land,
    are in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will
      the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage
      over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns. <strong>Then, but not till then,
      will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return. </strong>... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would
    be gained by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues
    are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and
    more important the more they are considered. ... </p>
    <p>... Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
    <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
          of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
          an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
          would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
          felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
        exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
    <ul>
        <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
        <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
          fine upon those qualities.</li>
        <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
          been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
          make
              me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
          you.</li>
        <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
        <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
          had done an injury to the state;</li>
        <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
        <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
        <li><strong>We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</strong></li>
        <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
          grain,</li>
        <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
          to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
          before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
        prices. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital does not come first.
Land
and labour are the only two absolutely necessary factors to the
production of wealth. (Hear, hear.) Capital is the child of labour
exerted upon land. (Cheers.) Give labour access to land and it will
produce capital. Give labour access to land and the power of the
capitalists to grind the masses must disappear. (Hear, hear.) What
does that power came from? Merely from the fact that men are unable
to employ themselves upon the land. It is the poverty of the
labourers, not the wealth of the capitalist, that is the evil to be
removed. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital is wealth produced by labour from
land, used again in increasing the production of wealth. And not only
will it not hurt labour to leave to capital its full reward but we
must leave to capital its full natural reward, if we would have a
progressive community &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and if we would give
each what is his due. (Hear, hear.) What the labourers have to fight
against is not competition &#8211; (hear hear and &#8220;Yes&#8221;)
&#8211; but the restriction of production to their injury. Let there
be competition all around from the highest to the lowest, fencing in
no class against competition.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abolish
monopoly everywhere, put all
men on an equal footing and then trust to freedom.</span> In that way
we
would have the most delicate system of co-operation that can possibly
be devised by the wit of man. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The fight of labour is not against
capital; it is against monopoly. Why just think of that state of
things. when all the means of production belong to the community and
all production is regulated by the State, when every individual would
have, his work, his time of work, and everything else prescribed for
him; when it would be utterly impossible for men to employ
themselves! To abolish competition you must have restriction; you
must call on the coercive powers of the State. How else are you going
to do it? Supposing you organise industry in the way our friends
dream of, if any individuals go outside of this organization and
propose to compete with it, how are you going to stop their
competition but by coming in with the strong arm of the law, and
putting an end to it? Why such a state of society, instead of being
the ideal to which the Anglo-Saxon community ought to aspire, would
be going back to a worse despotism than, that of ancient, Egypt.

    The Meaning of the Terms</a> (Book I, Chapter 2)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But it is more difficult to clear away from the idea of <strong>capital</strong> the
      ambiguities that beset it, and to fix the scientific use of the term. In general
      discourse, all sorts of things that have a value or will yield a return are
      vaguely spoken of as capital, while economic writers vary so widely that the
      term can hardly be said to have a fixed meaning. Let us compare with each other
    the definitions of a few representative writers: ... </p>
  <p>... This common sense of the term is that of wealth devoted to procuring
      more wealth. Dr. Adam Smith correctly expresses this common idea when he
    says: &quot;That
      part of a man's stock which he expects to afford him revenue is called his
    capital.&quot; ...</p>
  <p> Land, labor, and capital are the three factors of
      production. If we remember that <strong>capital</strong> is thus a term used in contradistinction
      to land and labor, we at once see that nothing properly included under either
      one of these terms can be properly classed as capital. The term <strong>land</strong> necessarily
      includes, not merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water
      and the air, but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it
      is only by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man
      can come in contact with or use nature. The term land embraces, in short, all
      natural materials, forces, and opportunities, and, therefore, nothing that
      is freely supplied by nature can be properly classed as capital. A fertile
      field, a rich vein of ore, a falling stream which supplies power, may give
      to the possessor advantages equivalent to the possession of capital, but to
      class such things as capital would be to put an end to the distinction between
      land and capital, and, so far as they relate to each other, to make the two
      terms meaningless. The term <strong>labor</strong>, in like manner, includes
      all human exertion, and hence human powers whether natural or acquired can
      never properly be classed as capital. In common parlance we often speak of
      a man's knowledge, skill, or industry as constituting his capital; but this
      is evidently a metaphorical use of language that must be eschewed in reasoning
      that aims at exactness. Superiority in such qualities may augment the income
      of an individual just as capital would, and an increase in the knowledge, skill,
      or industry of a community may have the same effect in increasing its production
      as would an increase of capital; but this effect is due to the increased power
      of labor and not to capital. Increased velocity may give to the impact of a
      cannon ball the same effect as increased weight, yet, nevertheless, weight
    is one thing and velocity another.</p>
  <p><font size="-3">[26] </font>Thus we must exclude from the category of capital
      everything that may be included either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain
      only things which are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted from
      the union of these two original factors of production. Nothing can be properly
      capital that does not consist of these that is to say, nothing can be capital
      that is not wealth. ... <a href="HG/PP/03_b1_c2_meaning_of_the_terms.htm">read the entire chapter </a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note     49: The primary error in all forms of socialism consists in ignoring
    the fact that Capital is but a product of labor and land; or what in effect
      is the same thing, in disregarding the necessary inference that land is
      the only implement of labor. Intelligent socialists insist that they do
      not ignore it; but that, while acknowledging land to be the primary implement
      of labor, they see in this only an abstract formula, having at the present
      stage of civilization no practical importance. Society, they urge, is impossible
      without Capital; and he who would live in society must have Capital, or
      be the slave of those who do have it. Therefore, they, argue, Capital is
      in the social state as indispensable as land. Their reasoning hinges upon
      the mistaken assumption that Capital is an accumulation of the past instead
      of being a product of the present. As one socialistic author puts it, &quot;Though
      labor may originally have preceded Capital, yet it is now as absurd to
      place one before the other as it is to attempt to say whether the hen originates
      the egg or the egg the hen.&quot; The explanation of division of labor
      and trade. the effect of which is overlooked by socialistic philosophies,
      affords a better opportunity than the present for considering this elementary
      error of socialism, and a brief discussion of the subject will be given
      in that connection. See post, note 81. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q49. Would the single tax abolish interest?</em><br>
A. I do not think so. Interest properly understood is a form of wages, and so
  far from abolishing it, the single tax, which would tend to increase all forms
  of wages, would tend to increase interest. But monopoly profits are often confounded
  with interest, and by force of association have given to interest a bad name;
  these would be minimized if not wholly abolished by the single tax. It is impossible
  to answer this question intelligibly to everyone who asks it, without requiring
  him to be specific; for it is seldom that two persons agree as to what they
  mean by interest. The Western farmer thinks of the high rate that he pays,
  partly for risk, partly from his ignorance of the modus operandi of banking,
  and partly because legitimate banking facilities are scarce in his Community;
  the Wall Street operator thinks of the premiums that he pays for currency in
  times of stress to tide him over from day to day; others think of &quot;interest&quot; on
  government bonds, and others of dividends of companies with valuable land rights.
  None of these payments are really interest, and the single tax would tend to
  rid society of them. But that advantage which the workmen enjoy whose implements
  and materials are already gathered, over those who have yet to devote time
  to gathering implements and materials, an advantage which is expressed in money
  and as interest upon capital, will not, I should think, be abolished by anything
  that man can do. The value of such an advantage is part of the wages of the
  labor that creates it. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it must
always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor in further
production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without it, and
there must have been production without it, or it could not in the first place
have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming after and resulting
from the union of labor and land in the production of wealth. It is in essence
labor raised by a second union with land to a third or higher power. But it is
to civilized life so necessary and important as to be rightfully accorded in
political economy the place of a third factor in production. &#8212; <em>The

    <br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

    <br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book
III, Chapter 4: The Laws of Distribution: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits
Often Mistaken For Interest</a></p>
  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
            <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
            <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book

      of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
  Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A.<strong> Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
    and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
    Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
    A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
      of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
      is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
      Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
      and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Proper
Disposition of Returns to Different Factors of Production</b>
</small><br>
<small>The idea that the rent of land is properly collected by
governments is an example of the more general idea that it is
important to distinguish the different "factors of production"
identified by classical political economy. The return to each factor
has a proper destination.
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The contributions of human abilities to productive efforts
are called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">labor</span>," the return
to labor is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">wages</span>," and
the appropriate recipients of wages are those whose labor contributes
to productive activities.</small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>The contributions of
past human products to productive efforts are called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">capital</span>," the return to capital is
called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">interest</span>," and the
appropriate recipients of interest are those who past saving made the
creation of capital possible.</small></li>
  <li><small>The contributions of government-assigned opportunities to
the productive process are called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">land</span>,"
the return to land is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">rent</span>,"
and the appropriate recipient of rent is the public treasury.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><b>Replacing Existing
  Taxes</b></small></p>
  <p><small>When we say that the appropriate
    recipient of rent is the public
    treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
    existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing
    sources of public revenue.</small></p>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those who contribute labor to productive processes should
be allowed to keep the wages that result from their labor.</small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>Those whose saving
makes the creation of capital possible should be allowed to keep the
interest that accrues from the use of capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>But there is no one who has a corresponding claim to the
return to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and
other opportunities assigned by government ought to be the primary
source of government revenue.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While one might call such fees
"taxes," we consider that
designation inappropriate, because the word "tax" connotes an
exaction from someone of something to which he or she has a just
claim, and we deny that there are such just claims with respect to
land. We expect that the collection of fees for the full value of
opportunities assigned by governments would provide adequate revenue
for all necessary government expenditures. ...&nbsp; <a

Winston Churchill: <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">The
People's Land</a> &nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let the Manchester Ship
Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling -- or an average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
Now what had the landowner done for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.<br>
<br>
But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.<br>
<br>
Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in vaIue.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The shareholders and the ratepayers </span>I
have told you what happened to the landowners. Let us see what
happened to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">shareholders </span>and
the ratepayers who found the money. The ordinary shareholders, who
subscribed eight millions, have had no dividend yet. The Corporation
loan of five millions interest on which is borne on the rates each
year, had, until 1907, no return upon its capital. A return has come at
last, and no doubt the future prospects are good; but there was a long
interval -- even for the corporation. These are the men who did the
work. These are the men who put up the money. I want to ask you a
question. Do you think it would be very unfair if the owners of all
this automatically created land value due to the growth of the city, to
the enterprise of the community, and to the sacrifices made by the
shareholders -- do you think it would have been very unfair, if they
had been made to pay a proportion, at any rate, of the unearned
increment which they secured, back to the city and the community? ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
On the other hand, the Fed statistics<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
understate land values for methodological reasons. Starting with
estimates for overall real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>37 Balance Sheets for the
U.S.
Economy, 1945-94, Tables B. 11, B. 12 and R 11.
</small></small></font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><small></small>However, the value of any building tends
eventually to decline,
until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
not its current net income but its opportunity cost -- the minimum
yield
required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.</small>
