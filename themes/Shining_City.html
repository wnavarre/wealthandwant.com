  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
    Shining City</span>    </div>
  <p>How do we go about making our cities thriving centers for all? Henry George
    suggested the route, the way to share equally in the commons and in all that
    civilization creates, rather than awarding the privilege of collecting the
    tolls to a few well-situated folks. But the well-situated of his day &#8212; what
    we today call &quot;special interests&quot; &#8212; liked it just fine the
    way it was, thank you, and made sure it stayed that way. Need we let them
    continue to be the beneficiaries of everyone's labor?</p>

<p><br>
    Henry George: <a href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html">Ode to
    Liberty&nbsp;</a> (1877 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE HONOR LIBERTY in name and in
form. We set up her statues and
sound her praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our
growth so grow her demands. She will have no half service! Liberty!
it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the
law of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and
co-operation. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> They who look upon Liberty as
having accomplished her mission
when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the
ballot, who think of her as having no further relations to the
everyday affairs of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to
them the poets who have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her
martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as well as of light;
as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all growth,
supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold
and inert mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so
is Liberty to mankind. It is not for an abstraction that men have
toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty have
stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have suffered. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We speak of Liberty as one
thing, and of virtue, wealth,
knowledge, invention, national strength and national independence as
other things. But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother,
the necessary condition.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In our time, as in times before,
creep on the insidious forces
that, producing inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the
clouds begin to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow her
further; we must trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept her or
she will not stay. It is not enough that men should vote; it is not
enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law. They
must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means
of life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty
of nature. Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this,
or darkness comes on, and the very forces that progress has evolved
turn to powers that work destruction. This is the universal law. This
is the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in
justice the social structure cannot stand. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In
allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
as material progress goes on. </span>This is the subtle alchemy that
in
ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
anarchy. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is this that turns the
blessings of material progress into a
curse.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> But if, while there is
yet time, we turn to Justice and obey
her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
threaten must disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to
agencies of elevation. </span>Think of the powers now wasted; of the
infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">With want destroyed; with greed
changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?

of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
I am talking too long; but let me in a few words point out the way of
getting rid of land monopoly, securing the right of all to the elements
which are necessary for life. We could not divide the land. In a rude
state of society, as among the ancient Hebrews, giving each family its
lot and making it inalienable we might secure something like equality.
But in a complex civilisation that will not suffice. It is not,
however, necessary to divide up the land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">All that is necessary is to divide up the
income that comes from the land. </span>In that way we can secure
absolute equality; nor could the adoption of this principle involve any
rude shock or violent change. It can be brought about gradually and
easily by abolishing taxes that now rest upon capital, labour and
improvements, and raising all our public revenues by the taxation of
land values; and the longer you think of it the clearer you will see
that in every possible way will it be a benefit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, supposing we should abolish all other taxes direct and
indirect, substituting for them a tax upon land values, what would be
the effect? </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In the first place it would be to kill speculative values.
It would be to remove from the newer parts of the country the bulk of
the taxation and put it on the richer parts. It would be to exempt the
pioneer from taxation and make the larger cities pay more of it. It
would be to relieve energy and enterprise, capital and labour, from all
those burdens that now bear upon them. What a start that would give to
production! <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In the second place we could, from the value of the land,
not merely pay all the present expenses of the government, but we could
do infinitely more.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In the city of San
Francisco James Lick left a few blocks of ground to be used for public
purposes there, and the rent amounts to so much, that out of it will be
built the largest telescope in the world, large public baths and other
public buildings, and various costly works. If, instead of these few
blocks, the whole value of the land upon which the city is built had
accrued to San Francisco what could she not do?&nbsp; </span>... <a

<br>
Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not
Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in
this world, and in our civilization. There is a provision made by the
laws of the Creator which would secure to the helpless all that they
require, which would give enough and more than enough for all social
purposes. These little children that are dying in our crowded districts
for want of room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a
great estate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Did you ever consider the full meaning of the significant fact
that as progress goes on, as population increases and civilization
develops, the one thing that ever increases in value is land?
Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever there
is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a great
city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the bounty
of the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or an oil
well, or a gas deposit, there the speculator jumps in, land rises in
value, and a great boom takes place, and people find themselves
enormously rich without ever having done a single thing to produce
wealth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that land steadily
increases in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to
it; that the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s
goodness in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use
adds to the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This
natural fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law
of the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is the intent of this natural law of increasing land
values? Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land
values grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to society as a whole, with which we
may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with which we may meet
public expenses, and do all the things that an advancing civilization
makes more and more necessary for society to do on behalf of its
members?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Today the value of land in New York city is over a hundred
million annually. Who has created that value? Is it because a few
landowners are here that that land is worth a hundred million a year?
Is it not because the whole population of New York is here? Is it not
because this great city is the center of exchanges for a large portion
of the continent? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Does not every
child that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it
not add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some
portion of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being
used for that purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to
appropriate the fund of land values?</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production. ...&nbsp;<a
