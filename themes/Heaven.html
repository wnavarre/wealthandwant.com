<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
    <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
      than their share of labor on others.</li>
    <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
      as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
      their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same
      right of excluding their fellows.</li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that
        all men are children of God the common Father; that all have the same
        last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the
      unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet in all
      this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
      of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
      and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
      give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
    made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
    gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
    that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
    Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
    priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
    of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
    grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    themed collection of
excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable us to say
    with something like scientific precision that this man is rich and that man
    is poor; some line of possession which will enable us truly to distinguish
    between rich and poor in all places and conditions of society; a line of
    the natural mean or normal possession, below which in varying degrees is
    poverty, and above which in varying degrees is wealthiness? It seems to me
    that there must be. And if we stop to think of it, we may see that there
    is. If we set aside for the moment the narrower economic meaning of service,
    by which direct service is conveniently distinguished from the indirect service
    embodied in wealth, we may resolve all the things which directly or indirectly
    satisfy human desire into one term service, just as we resolve fractions
    into a common denominator. Now is there not a natural or normal line of the
    possession or enjoyment of service? Clearly there is. It is that of equality
    between giving and receiving. This is the equilibrium which Confucius expressed
    in the golden word of his teaching that in English we translate into "reciprocity."&nbsp; Naturally
    the services which a member of a human society is entitled to receive from
    other members are the equivalents of those he renders to others. Here is
    the normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what we call poverty
    take their start. He who can command more service than he need render, is
    rich. He is poor, who can command less service than he does render or is
    willing to render: for in our civilization of today we must take note of
    the monstrous fact that men willing to work cannot always find opportunity
    to work. The one has more than he ought to have; the other has less. Rich
    and poor are thus correlatives of each other; the existence of a class of
    rich involves the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse; and abnormal
    luxury on the one side and abnormal want on the other have a relation of
    necessary sequence. To put this relation into terms of morals, the rich are
    the robbers, since they are at least sharers in the proceeds of robbery;
    and the poor are the robbed. This is the reason, I take it, why Christ, Who
    was not really a man of such reckless speech as some Christians deem Him
    to have been, always expressed sympathy with the poor and repugnance of the
    rich. In His philosophy it was better even to be robbed than to rob. In the
    kingdom of right doing which He preached, rich and poor would be impossible,
    because rich and poor in the true sense are the results of wrong-doing. And
    when He said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
    than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven," He simply put in the
    emphatic form of Eastern metaphor a statement of fact as coldly true as the
    statement that two parallel lines can never meet. Injustice cannot live where
    justice rules, and even if the man himself might get through, his riches &#8212; his
    power of compelling service without rendering service &#8212; must of necessity
    be left behind. If there can be no poor in the kingdom of heaven, clearly
    there can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible in this, or in any
    other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty, without at the same time
    abolishing unjust possessions. This is a hard word to the softly amiable
    philanthropists, who, to speak metaphorically, would like to get on the good
    side of God without angering the devil. But it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; <em>The

  <p>IT is the noblest cause in which any human being can possibly engage. What,
    after all, is there in life as compared with a struggle like this? One thing,
    and only one thing, is absolutely certain for every man and woman in this
    hall, as it is to all else of human kind &#8212; that is death. What will
    it profit us in a few years how much we have left? Is not the noblest and
    the best use we can make of life to do something to make better and happier
    the condition of those who come after us &#8212; by warning against injustice,
    by the enlightenment of public opinion, by the doing all that we possibly
    can do to break up the accursed system that degrades and embitters the lot
    of so many? <br>
            <br>
We have a long fight and a hard fight before us. Possibly, probably, for many
of us, we may never see it come to success. But what of that? It is a privilege
to be engaged in such a struggle. This we may know, that it is but a part of
that great, world-wide, long-continued struggle in which the just and the good
of every age have been engaged; and that we, in taking part in it, are doing
something in our humble way to bring on earth the kingdom of God, to make the
conditions of life for those who come afterward, those which we trust will prevail
in heaven. &#8212; <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a> <br>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
      (1889 speech)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; asked Mr
Thomas. &#8220;I thought
everybody had plenty in heaven.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;It used to be that way some time
ago,&#8221; said the
warden: &#8220;And if you wanted to get your harp polished or your
wings combed, you had to do it yourself. But matters have changed
since we adopted the same kind of property regulations in heaven as
you have in civilised countries on earth, and we find it a great
improvement, at least for the better class.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the warden told the newcomer
that he had better decide
where he was going to board.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to board anywhere,&#8221;
said Thomas:
&#8220;I would much rather go over to that beautiful green knoll and
lie down.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I would not advise you to do
so,&#8221; said the warden:
&#8220;The angel who owns that knoll does not like to encourage
trespassing. Some centuries ago, as I told you, we introduced the
system of private property into the soil of heaven. So we divided the
land up. It is all private property now.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I hope I was considered in that
division?&#8221; said
Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;No,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;You were
not; but if you
go to work, and are saving, you can easily earn enough in a couple of
centuries to buy yourself a nice piece. You get a pair of wings free
as you come in, and you will have no difficulty in hypothecating them
for a few days board until you find work. But I should advise you to
be quick about it, as our population is constantly increasing, and
there is a great surplus of labour. Tramp angels are, in fact,
becoming quite a nuisance.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What shall I go to work at?&#8221;
asked Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our principal industries are the
making of harps and
crowns and the growing of flowers,&#8221; responded the warden:
&#8220;But there any many opportunities for employment in personal
service.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I love flowers,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;I
will go to work
growing them, There is a beautiful piece of land over there that
nobody seems to be using. I will go to work on that.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the
warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven?&nbsp; ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"
