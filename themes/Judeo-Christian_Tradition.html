      </span>a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
      Wasteland to Promised land:
      Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a>
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Judeo-Christian meaning of
      liberation is clarified by some
      attention to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Baal</span>, the most
      active "foreign god" of the Canaanite pantheon. To the Canaanites,
      fertility depended upon sexual union between Baal and his sister and
      consort, Anath. Baal worship consisted in reenacting the mating of the
      gods in orgiastic rites with temple prostitutes.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Beyond maintaining natural fertility and
      harmony, Baal religion was used by the aristocracy to uphold the social
      order. Canaanite tenants worked as dispossessed farmers on estates
      owned by magnates, the temple, and the king. They worshiped the
      landowners, the baals, who held dominion over both the land and the
      peasants themselves. </span>Old Testament exhortations against Baalism
      emphasize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the proper way to
      worship Yahweh: by acting with mercy and justice towards one's fellow
      humans.</span></small><br style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <br>
      <small>Because justice does not prevail when
      some, like the baals, claim the land and its bounty while others are
      excluded from these privileges, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Hosea </span>denounces Israel for
      betraying its covenant to recognize God as the true owner of the earth.
      And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amos</span>,
      referring to the greed for possessing the land and its fruits, said God
      is angered by those "who trample upon the needy, and bring the poor of
      the land to an end" (Amos 8:4).<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Amos'
      indictment of Israel mentions oppression of the poor and cultic
      prostitution as if they were one (Amos 2:6-8). This seems strange until
      one recognizes that the link between these two sins is a wrongful
      concept of land ownership.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Recall that Baal-worship and its
      sexual rites glorified inequitable land possession and control. </span>In
      the
      Prophets, the role of land is crucial in the divine providential
      scheme, and the flouting of just principles of land possession has
      grave consequences. Human beings are caretakers, not the owners, of
      God's creation.</small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Amos and Hosea underscored that
      being
      a caretaker of the earth, while defining people's relationship to the
      land, also defined people's relationship to one another. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Being a
      caretaker meant loving justice and doing mercy, letting go of selfish
      possession and the desire for power over others by usurping their means
      of livelihood, and instead becoming, like God, compassionate. </span>Consider
      what a revolutionary break this represents from Baal worship, which
      idolized control of the soil and deified the landowners!</span> ...</small><br>

      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Claiming the Promised Land: A
      New
      Jubilee for a New World</span></small><br>
      <small>In the book of Joshua, we find that although the Promised Land
      is a
      gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even before the
      actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed a
      method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's
      sight. The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with
      human sacrifice and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive,
      monopolistic social order. By contrast, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel, to make good its claim,
      had to institute a social order that would guard against the
      desecration, pollution, and injustices of which its predecessors were
      guilty, and would secure to each family and to every generation within
      the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use of the land, of
      which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner. </span></small><small><a

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>We were talking about the tendency for landowners
        to use land as an investment &#8212; a
            sensible thing to do &#8212; not to use it now if they don't need to, but
            to think in terms of enjoying its increase in value over time. We even
            identified that as the key to the problem of poverty. But &#8212; good
            heavens, what can we do about that? Isn't that just how the economy
            works? Isn't the private ownership of land a basic part of a modern
            economy? How
          can we do without such an important institution?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>Or in other words &#8212; won't the poor
        always be with us?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>Not necessarily. It has been plain, since
        very earliest days of civil society, that the private ownership of land
        leads to exploitation and great
            extremes of wealth and poverty. And, since the time of the Book of
        Leviticus, we have had a pretty good idea of what to do about it. In
        that book were
            recorded the words &quot;The land shall not be sold for ever, for
            the land is Mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.&quot;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> This ideal was codified into a remarkable three-stage program for economic
          justice and social harmony: the land laws of Leviticus. The stages were:</div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> <strong>1. The Sabbath.</strong> Every seventh day was the Lord's day;
              people were enjoined to keep it holy and refrain from work. Now, we were
              told in Sunday school that this was all about going to church, but, as
              so often happens, our teachers missed the deeper significance. Kids who
              try to get out of, say, taking out the garbage on the Sabbath realized
              that the prohibition was really against gainful work; folks were still
              allowed to weed the garden and stuff. <br>
        What the Sabbath did was to force people to focus on things that
              had meaning beyond striving and striving to get ahead. Indeed,
              if one did work on the
          Sabbath, while one's neighbors did not, one could become wealthier,
              at their expense &#8212; which was why the Sabbath was a very big
              deal: one of the ten commandments.<br>
        <strong>2. The Sabbatical.</strong> Every seventh year, the fields
                were to lie fallow &#8212; thus recognizing the right of the
                earth itself to be protected against depletion and misuse. And,
                in the sabbatical
                year, debts were to be forgiven. A debt that could not be paid
                off after six years was well on the way to becoming a usurious
                burden,
                a guaranteed flow from the labors of one into the coffers of
                another. The canceling of debts in the seventh year was designed
                to ensure that
                nobody got too far ahead, or too far behind.<br>
        <strong>3. The Jubilee.</strong> Even seven times seven years
                (actually, every 50th year), each family could return to its
                original allotment,
                or heritage, of land &#8212; even if it had been sold in the meantime.
                Under biblical law, then, land could not be sold for ever &#8212; never
                for more than a single generation. </div>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Now it is interesting to note that the economic
        vision presented in the bible is not a precursor of communism. Two of
        the ten commandments explicitly
              support the institution of private property, and the prophets consistently
              railed against landlords and rulers who robbed the people of the
        fruits of their labor. The laws of Leviticus, which Jesus said he &quot;came not
              to destroy but to fulfill,&quot; envisioned a community in which everyone
              was secure in his own home and property, &quot;beneath his vine and fig
          tree&quot;. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>(Incidentally, the quote on the American
        Liberty Bell, from Leviticus, chapter 25, was a direct reference to these
        principles : &quot;Proclaim
              liberty throughout the land and to all the people thereof.&quot; It
              was a reference to the Jubilee, and the freedom it provided was
              from debt and
          servitude.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>The division is clear: there is to be a sacred right of private property
            in the things that are made by people. But people were not to own the things
            that were made by God. The 7th commandment sums up both principles in 4
        words: <em>Thou shalt not steal</em>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>Modern society has looked away from these
        principles, calling them quaint, naive, inapplicable to the complexities
        of our time &#8212; yet, modern
              society finds itself mired in chronic economic and social problems for
              which it can find no solutions &#8212; and which threaten to pull down
              all the advances of civilization into a dark age &#8212; occasioned
              by some combination of war, financial implosion or ecological collapse. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>If there is any way out of this dark future, it can only come by way
        of solving the problem of land and justice. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>Fortunately, there exists a plan for that. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>This plan takes the shape of a &quot;fiscal reform&quot;, because it
            applies a definition of the relationship between the individual and the
            society that is consistent with both economic efficiency and moral law.
            It calls for us to respect the right of labor to create and to save wealth,
            and we acknowledge that the value of land is created not by its &#8220;owners&#8221;,
        but by the entire community. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Therefore, we will abolish all taxes on income,
      products and sales &#8212; and
              collect the full rental value of land and other natural resources
      for public revenue. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

    The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a> </p>
  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
          for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
          Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
          church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
          incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
          while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less
          than $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there
          had been no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in
          the country. Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated
          onto the national scene. ... <br>
    While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like "horrific" and "monstrous
          injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax reform approach which
          shifts taxes off of low wage earners and onto large land owners. Through
          a combination
          of her own reasoning, caring heart, and inherent sense of justice and
          a thorough investigation of Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived
          at a tax
          policy approach which bears remarkable similarities to the economic
          justice crusades of 19th
    century reformer, Henry George.<br>
    <br>
    Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call themselves Christians.
    Hamill challenges them to put their faith into practice. Her message fell on
    many already listening ears. The state's two largest denominations, United Methodists
    and Southern Baptists, had passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In
    2001 the state's Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar
    calls. The Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council
    of Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now supported
    by most of the state's religious organizations, according to Charles Durham,
    pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
    <br>
    What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama tax
    code combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural bases for
    economic
    justice. She quotes chapters and verses which proclaim that the poor should
    not be oppressed and that society should create conditions for their advance.
    Among
    her favorites are Jesus'
    words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
    you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich man sent to hell
    because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
    in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so
    all went well."<br>
    <br>
    While Hamill suspected she would be opposed by special interest groups like
    the Alabama Farmers Federation which represents big timber and agribusiness
    interests,
    she was not prepared for the attacks and underhanded tactics of the Alabama
    Christian Coalition under the leadership of President John Giles. While Giles
    agrees that
    tax relief
    to the less fortunate "is a noble thing" he says the care of the poor is the
    duty of private charity not of government and staunchly opposes tax increases.
    He tried to damage the Hamill campaign by smearing her personal integrity, pointing
    to her signing of a pro-choice petition as evidence that she therefore could
    not be a moral authority on tax
    reform. Opposing forces also called her a "Yankee carpetbagger" detailing
    her work history at two New York law firms. They said (wrongly so) that her
    tax proposals
    would bring huge property increases
    on the average home and business.<br>
    <br>
    Bob Blalock, editorial page editor for The Birmingham News, says that
    the "real question about legitimacy should be aimed at the Christian Coalition.
    For whom does it speak when it attacks Hamill? Christians, many of whom would
    benefit from a fairer tax system, even one that raised more money? Or powerful
    special-interest groups (timber? agribusiness?) that want to protect their obscene
    tax breaks?" Blalock says there is no way to know because the law does not require
    the
    Christian Coalition to disclose what individuals or groups fund it. "When an
    organization places itself in the center of the debate over tax reform, citizens
    deserve to know who's funding its point of view." (3/14/03)<br>
    <br>
    Hamill's conservative theology school responded to the attacks by firmly
    backing her stance. Faculty at Beeson Divinity School of Samford University
    in Birmingham
    passed a unanimous resolution endorsing her
    efforts. "We think what she has proposed is worthy support from the Christian
    community and we think it is in keeping with the evangelical
    community," said the school's dean, Timothy George (Anniston Star,
    3/11/03).<br>
    <br>
    Frank Thielman, Presbyterian Professor of Divinity at Beeson had this to
    say about their resolution: "Personally, I hope it does encourage dramatic tax reform
    that helps to relieve the burden of the poor. The reason I'm hopeful is because
    of my commitment as a Christian and my Christian vision. That is a vision that
    the poor should be dealt with equitably and fairly and that is a very biblical
    vision. It's because of my Christian commitment and the Bible and the word of
    God that I
    hope tax reform efforts succeed." (Anniston Star, 3/11/03) ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read
