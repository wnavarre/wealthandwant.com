    Increasing Importance of Social Questions </a>(Chapter 1 of <em><a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
    Problems</a></em>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="style1">[17]</span> A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands
    of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably
    evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization is possible in which
    the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the
    rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies
    unthought of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence
    that will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are already
    in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment
    from the very excess of wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say
    manufacturers, &quot;and we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give
    us but work!&quot; cry idle men.</p>
  <p><span class="style1">[18] </span>The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
    of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
    of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
    forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
    produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
    Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
    but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet
    agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years
    ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption,
    we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph
    of mechanical skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had
    to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New
    York aldermen. The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned
    in a crazed and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only
    by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass
    is estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer could
    not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable.</p>
  <p><span class="style1">[19] </span>The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
    be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few, but
    that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political
    economy to college professors. The people themselves must think, because
    the people alone can act.</p>
  <p><span class="style1">[20] </span>In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
    the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
    This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
    having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But the
    salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of humanity,
    is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ. Social progress
    makes the well-being of all more and more the business of each; it binds
    all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can escape. He who
    observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes
    no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden
    under foot, save now and then to bestow aims, is not a true Christian. Nor
    is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder than this.</p>
  <p><span class="style1">[21] </span>The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not
    a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
    and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond self-interest,
    whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many. It must seek justice.
    For at the bottom of every social problem we will find a social wrong. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

<blockquote>
  <p>    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and
      all necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature
      dictates
        that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his
        own personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to
        enable
        them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
        of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
        by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his
        children by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in
        land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!

prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
the community should collect
let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
values.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People will come to a well run
community because they will be
better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
services.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This revenue can best be procured
when the community recaptures
the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
of, and provided by, the local city government.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
land rent as their primary source
of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
results.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
what he or she produces, but no
one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
users are willing to pay.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the value of land rent exceeds
the community's needs for public
services a method of dispensing of the surplus revenue can easily be
found. To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has special
benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
emergencies.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An ethical proposal might be to
then divide the excess revenue
that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
the remaining revenue. This is similar to the method used in Alaska
and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
an important source of public
revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small>The value of land can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy,
at
a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
responsibility of good government. <a

Alanna Hartzok:<a
 href="../docs/Hartzok_Ethical_LT.html">
Ethical Land Tenure</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I want to tell you the story of
Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the Judaic tradition, and the Talmudic tradition, how much of
the
Jubilee justice was actually implemented is a subject of discussion.
Some say it was a good idea but not put in place. Others say it was
substantially put into place.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists
because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For better soil,
richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The other thing was some lands
were closer to the market. Some land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market.</span> How do you have
an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">In
this, then, we see affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain. Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge.</span>.</small>
