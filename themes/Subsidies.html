<p>John Dewey: <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">Steps to Economic Recovery</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You have heard much about various steps that should be taken to
    promote economic recovery. I propose this evening to concentrate attention
    upon one
      step, a step absolutely fundamental to permanent recovery of the sick patient,
      as distinct from remedies that dope the patient into a temporary hectic
    burst of activity; a step so simple and so basic as to be generally neglected.</p>
  <p>The one thing uppermost in the minds of everybody today is the appalling existence
      of want in the midst of plenty, of millions of unemployed in the midst of idle
      billions of hoarded money and unused credit, as well as factories and mills
      deteriorating for lack of use, of hunger while farmers are burning grain for
      fuel.</p>
  <p>No wonder people are asking what sort of a crazy economic system we have when
      at a time when millions are short of adequate food, when babies are going without
      the milk necessary for their growth, the best remedy that experts can think
      of and that the Federal Government can recommend is to pay a premium to farmers
      to grow less grain with which to make flour to feed the hungry, and pay a premium
      to dairymen to send less milk to market.</p>
  <p>Henry George called attention to this situation over fifty years ago. The
      contradiction between increasing plenty, increase of potential security &#8212; and
      actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief work, <em><strong>Progress
      and Poverty</strong></em>. That is what his book is about. It is a record of the fact that
      as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty and insecurity
      also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires and tramps multiply
      together. It is a prediction of why this state of affairs will continue; it
      is a prediction of the plight in which the nation finds itself to-day. At the
      same time it is the explanation of why this condition is artificial, man-made,
      unnecessary, and how it can be remedied. So I suggest that as a beginning of
      the first steps to permanent recovery there be a nationwide revival of interest
      in the writings and teachings of Henry George and that there be such an enlightenment
      of public opinion that our representatives in legislatures and public places
      be compelled to adopt the changes he urged. ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice? ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
    Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Las Vegas, not a typical city,
is the
largest I know of that indeed
grows in worthless desert.&nbsp; Here another factor stands out
clearly:
new lands are peripheral and only imperfect, partial substitutes for
central land.&nbsp; The city must range farther for water, power, waste
disposal, raw materials and markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The high marginal cost of adding to spreading cities, and the
low true
net value of the additions, are concealed, in our culture, by an
elaborate and pervasive system of subsidies and cross-subsidies built
into our institutions and political power structures.&nbsp; These drain
the old centers to feed the fringes.&nbsp; In a systemwide accounting
we
find the true social cost of urban sprawl as we know it today to exceed
the gains at the margins.&nbsp; We are not so much adding land to
cities
as wasting capital, dissipating central rents to do it.&nbsp; Thus the
private rent gradient and resulting land-value gradient that we observe
in the marketplace is much flatter than the true gradient that is
hidden
under the subsidies.&nbsp; Even so, the visible gradient remains
impressive: values rise to $2,000/psf in San Francisco, Chicago and
Manhattan, and $25,000/psf in Tokyo.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land of rare and limited qualities is often the basis of market
control:
retail sites, rights-of-way, rare ores, water rights, are familiar
examples.&nbsp; Even land of less rare qualities is often used for
market
control.&nbsp; American farm output is controlled by means of acreage
limitations; Texas and now&nbsp;OPEC oil production by oil well
protates; and so
on. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole article</a><br>

Pollution: Tractable Solutions to Intractable Problems</a><br>

Economic Thinking </small><br>
<small>The Search for Surrogates </small><br>
<small>Sources of Nonpoint Pollution</small><br>

<small>What Problems are Unsolved by Excise Taxes on Surrogates?</small><br>
<small>The Case of Forestry</small><br>
<small>The Case of Urban Settlement</small><br>
<small>The Case of Agriculture</small><br>
<small>The Common Theme from Forest, City and Farm</small><br>
<small>Solutions</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><strong>...</strong>&nbsp; In fact, land use decisions are superimposed on a
settlement
pattern based on massive market failure in land.&nbsp; The phenomena
rather imprecisely called "land speculation" and "absentee ownership"
betray market failure; and no one disputes there is massive regulatory
failure in pricing and subsidizing transportation, which in turn
determine land rents and values.&nbsp; Result: the land market is not
efficient; land is not properly priced and allocated to begin
with.&nbsp; This is the thread I will follow, although it may run afoul
of The Great Secular Superstition.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Part of any solution here is to stop subsidizing dredging.&nbsp;
Subeconomic harbors would close; others would finance their own
dredging, with this bonus for the welfare of all: they would redirect
their lobbying budgets from the zero-sum game of soliciting federal
funds to the constructive game of promoting runoff control.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Sediment also silts up reservoirs; and again we have too many,
thanks
to a long history of subsidizing water supply in western states.&nbsp;
That is the pork you trade us for all those tiny harbors.&nbsp; We make
it worse by penalizing water conservation ("use-it-or-lose-it" is
the
rule).&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>The lobbies and the engineers don't see it that way, of course,
but
then that is part of the problem, isn't it?&nbsp; We are so used to
living and learning under the logic of the lobbies that we, the
rightful heirs of Emerson and Thoreau, are conditioned to reject our
own direct perceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>In the logic of true values we should probably put more weight
on other
damages, such as that land is sterilized, and people are
poisoned.&nbsp; Species are destroyed or constricted, leaving the
natural world to surviving coyotes, crows and sparrows.&nbsp;
High&#8209;grading the forests leaves weed trees to inherit the earth, a form
of genetic pollution.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Several writers treat salt runoff lightly.&nbsp; It may be of
small
concern in this region, but it is of monumental moment in the arid
west.&nbsp; Downstream water becomes unusable, and water pooling and
exchanging, from which so many economies could result, become much
harder to negotiate ("my water is better than your water,"
etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>While we can't blame Washington for everything, it has a lot to
answer
for here.&nbsp; Much salt runoff comes from Federally subsidized
water.&nbsp; Kesterson Refuge is poisoned by runoff from the Westlands
Water District, irrigated under heavy Federal subsidy from the Central
Valley Project (in spite of its long and notorious violation of acreage
limitation provisions of the Reclamation Act).&nbsp; The worst problem
on the Colorado is salt runoff from the Wellton-Mohawk project, near
Yuma, a subeconomic boondoggle from start to finish.&nbsp; All extant
Colorado River salt problems are now aggravated by the subsidized
Central Arizona Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>THE CASE OF AGRICULTURE</small><br>
<small>Farming manifests the same problem as forests and cities.&nbsp;
Public
policy suppresses full use of the best lands while subsidizing use and
abuse of marginal lands.&nbsp; As we said of urban sprawl, the more
land in use, the more runoff.&nbsp; Here are some elements that cause
"agricultural sprawl."&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a) Urban sprawl takes the best
land out of farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>b) Land retirement programs ...&nbsp; put good land on ice to
support prices.&nbsp; Under the resulting "price umbrella," marginal
land enters production.&nbsp; This is classic cartel
behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>c) Surpluses are destroyed at home, or dumped (sold below cost)
abroad, under Federal subsidy.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>d) Some crops associated with high erosion receive strong
support or protection: wheat, corn, cotton and sugarbeets, for
example.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>e) SCS funds are not allocated by need, but per Senator.&nbsp;
...</small><br>
<small>f) We raise a farmer's property tax assessment for installing a
truly conserving device like a Harvestore &#8212; it is so visible. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Meantime we subsidize new and submarginal lands in dozens of
ways.&nbsp; But on the farm as in the city, the more land, the more
runoff.&nbsp; I have cited the Feds for the Westlands Water District
draining into Kesterson Refuge, and the Wellton-Mohawk Project draining
into the Colorado River.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>The State of California is as bad.&nbsp; The whole arid
southwest
quarter of the Great Central Valley is being brought into cultivation
using subsidized water from the California Water Project's Westside
Canal.&nbsp; Promoters there have discovered another treadmill effect,
the "groundwater treadmill" of local-depletion-and-state-rescue,
a
treadmill that seems good for any number of cycles.&nbsp; But salt
runoff has reached such a pass that the next rescue requirement will be
a "brine line" to the sea, a line whose outlet is as sought-for as a
nuclear waste dump.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>South of the Tehachapis the MWD has its own variation, the
Mulholland
cycle.&nbsp; MWD frightens city voters with drought forecasts, secures
entitlements to excess water, and dumps it on surrounding deserts to
enrich land speculators there.&nbsp; While waiting for urban sprawl to
reach them they farm with the mindset of short-term tenants, caring
nothing for soil conservation or permanent farm
improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Mulholland began the game in 1913, storing Owens Valley water in
the
San Fernando Valley (remember Chinatown with Faye Dunaway and Jack
Nicholson?)&nbsp; It was too good not to replay; there have been
several Sons of Chinatown.&nbsp; MWD is now watering an "avocado
crescent" 200 miles north-south, with groves on slopes up to 45
degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Will pesticide taxation control those problems?&nbsp; Rather,
toxic
runoff is just another of several reasons why we must face up to
radical review of our political-economic treadmills, driven as they are
by what TIME Magazine has called<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The
Great American System of Public Works for Private Profit.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Value of Communities</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wearing pajamas outdoors in the
winter, one wouldn&#8217;t expect
to retain body heat. Yet, people do try to sustain community while
hemorrhaging its commonwealth. Losing it, residents must work more
than necessary.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When residents import food and
energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While mortgages and interest
elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other major
drain, taxes, at about 40% of the average

Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The rental value of oil, minerals, and water is more complex. Government often
      subsidizes water, especially to agriculture, selling below cost, whereas efficient
      provision would base the price on the market price, often above cost, the extra
      amount being rent. Offshore oil leases are commonly bid on by companies, and
      the bids are basically the rent they pay for the leases. There can also be
      extraction fees that take the rent as the raw material is taken out. Such fees
      can be paid for taking natural resources such as timber and wildlife. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>How to make the transition</p>
  <p><strong>The switch to land value taxation will affect most significantly those
        who own land at the time of the transition. These are the persons who have
        been
      subsidized, receiving site rental and land value from civic works paid for
      mostly by taxes on wages when earned or spent.</strong> But even many landowners
      would not see their total tax burden rise. Their wages, profits, interest,
      and consumption
      would all become untaxed, and taxes on their buildings and other improvements
      would be eliminated. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>The collection of land rent for public revenue reconciles the individual
    and the community. The community and its government no longer intrude into
    the
      individual&#8217;s private life and stifle his or her pursuit of economic
      well being. The tax on land value is not a tax in substance, but only in
      the form
      of payments to government. In substance, the payment is a sharing of the
      benefits provided by community and nature, and a payment for the services
      that generate
      the value of the land. If this payment is not made by the landholder, the
      services become a subsidy, producing a value not returned to the community.

<p>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
  or Rights-Deprived?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to landowners.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the
firm has
a charter from a government.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
others.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!" </span></small><small><a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...
The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
<small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>This relationship has been demonstrated more empirically in a
recent
study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
Portland Oregon,</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small>each additional mile [traveled]
  translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
  locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
  difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
  in new home value.</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>For a household in which one
worker
drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten
miles.
If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The American Automobile Association
calculated that a car driven 15,000
miles in 2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(9)</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Even
that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
on to society. </span>One study calculated that the total costs of
motor
vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small> I<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">n
1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
costs to society were ten times that;</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(11)</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> put
another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span

 style="font-style: italic;"></span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by Pricing:
Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span></small><br>
<small>Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
(but higher travel cost) locales.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Figure 2 shows how a tax on land value (or alternatively the tax
on
land rent) coupled with the proper design of transportation fees can
equilibrate the competitive advantage of markets in urban areas
relative to suburbs, thereby reducing, and perhaps even reversing, the
centrifugal forces of sprawl development. The land tax cannot alone
redress the problem, especially so long as such inordinate social
subsidies are granted to private motor vehicle transportation services.
Nor can transportation fees, raised to a level fully commensurate with
the social and private costs they incur, alone ensure that the price of
locations will be matched. But to the extent that both are assessed,
they reach far toward correcting this disequilibrium. One could even
argue that all site rent should be recaptured by society and that all
transportation costs that are identifiable as consumption of private
goods should be priced accordingly. Some advocates even suggest that
doing so will not only foster economic efficient behavior but also
provide sufficient revenue for a citizen's dividend consistent with
economic justice.... <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perverse fiscal federalism is
DEsocialization of rent -- creating
new private rents using public monies wrung from workers. This is
inherent in grants for capital spending, e.g. for sewerage; and tax
exemption of muni bonds. These are given to municipalities as such.
That is only a step away from returning dollars to landowners as
such, because municipalities are defined as areas of land, a group of
local landowners. Desocialization is inherent in farm subsidies,
e.g. payments to fallow land, using tax money from workers. It is
inherent in preferential assessment of farmland, e.g. California's
Williamson Act, where the state pays localities for their lost tax
revenues from underutilizing lands. It is inherent in the use of
property-tax exemptions to subsidize many underutilizations of land
and hobbies of the rich, like redundant airports for private jets,
cemeteries, golf courses, campuses, church parking lots, conservation
easements, timber, etc. Some of these may foster socially defensible
uses, but note it is the lands, not the personnel, that are

the product of free choice</b>
</small><br>
<small>A favorite fallacy is that sprawl results from free individual
choice. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, sprawl results
mainly from subsidies to sprawl,
enforced through taxation and/or utility rate regulation. Thus it is
imposed, not freely chosen. </span>The classic case, which exemplifies
the

gives you the idea.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In British Columbia, people move
around a good deal by car-ferry,
because of the terrain. The Provincial Government ("The Crown
Provincial") runs the system. There are many lovely little islands in
the Straits of Georgia, between Vancouver Island and the mainland,
favored by the wealthy, the exclusive and reclusive. Being more
sybaritic than Henry D. Thoreau, and politically puissant, they have
demanded and received car-ferry service. This service costs about $10
for every $1 in revenue. The resulting deficit is covered by raising
rates on the main plebeian line, Victoria-Vancouver. Naturally, these
cheap ferries attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for
land there.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The public pays
twice</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let's go back to those Channel
Islands in British Columbia, with
subsidized car-ferries. Naturally, as I said, these cheap ferries
attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for land there.
Developers and hopeful subdividers bid up land prices. This is not
what the old settlers had in mind: their environment is threatened,
including the habitat of endangered species. They appeal to the
Crown, which subsidizes their ferries, to help them preserve land for
habitat.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They want the government to buy
some of it, paying the high prices
created by the ferry subsidy, to keep it from use by people who might
use the ferries. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the government
would pay twice: to subsidize
the ferries, and then to retire the land at the high prices made
possible by the ferries. </span>Failing that, they want the Crown to
downzone most of it. The landowners are not charged when the ferries
raise their asking prices, but demand compensation when
downzoned.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here,
in microcosm, is the American
problem with sprawl and
habitat. </span>Multiply that ferry subsidy a thousand times, and you
have
the Great American System of Public Works and Services for Private
Gain.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> First the public pays
to bring urban demand to remote lands;
now the landowners, the spoiled children of the national family,
demand to be paid again for downzoning or selling that same land to
preserve habitat. They demand payment not to cash in on the
opportunities we just gave them free.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>T<span style="font-weight: bold;">hus
far, it is true, the courts
have let us downzone without
compensating. However, now a storm has gathered. Proposition 300, on
the ballot in Arizona, demands compensation for downzoning - it is
aimed at the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. There is
a movement in Congress to compensate for any Federal regulation that
devalues land by more than 50%.</span> It is led by Congressman Billy
Tauzin, a Democrat from Louisiana. You can imagine what a more
conservative Congress might do. Speculative landowners may soon get
everything they demand, leaving heavy debts to which their light tax
payments now contribute very little.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Proactive
solutions</b>
</small><br>
<small>How do we dig out from this one? </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>I'll repeat: <span style="font-weight: bold;">go with the
flow
of
cutting public spending by cutting down subsidies to urban sprawl.</span>
They are a major source of the problem. We'll never win the
environmental fight until those subsidies are withdrawn.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second proactive
solution is
to motivate and help the owners of
good land to sell or develop it.</span> To help them, make infilling a
positive goal. If you put impost fees on new buildings, do so only in
outlying areas that require new public services, not on new buildings
that help renew places like South Central L.A. If you ration sewer
hookups, save them for central land with street improvements already
in place.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those are the carrots. A good
stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there. </span>Proposition
13
makes this difficult, but not impossible: many special assessments
have the essential motivating quality of land taxes, with a different
legal form, that exempts them from Proposition 13.</small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>6. "You
can't stop
a landowner from pumping on his own land"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! You can even control his
hunting and fishing there, and
apply police power. As to pumping, it depends on whether he owns what
is under his land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is oil, we all know mineral
rights are routinely severed
from surface rights by sale, reservation or lease. Water can be
subject to constraints, too. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Limits on pumping water are not as
common or severe as Huey
Johnson and I think they should be, but they do exist. In coastal
areas, pumping is limited and/or taxed to stop salt water intrusion.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Further inland, pumping can be
stopped to control movement of
toxic plumes that destroy valuable aquifers: this is done in the
Bunker Hill aquifer under the Santa Ana River, threatened with
fouling by toxins from Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pumping is routinely stopped to
prevent 'export' of water from
lands overlying an aquifer: California calls that the 'correlative
rights' doctrine. It is not always well observed, and not often
well-advised, but very well established. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If that does not suffice to stop
overdraft, pumping is controlled
to prorate water among surface owners, and shorten pump lifts. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Also, pumping wells near streams
can be stopped to prevent the
indirect diversion of surface water. This happens on the alluvial
fans that are so common in the west. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A simple solution to half our
tractable water problems would be
a severance tax on water withdrawals. If you can regulate it you can
tax it. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A tax can be viewed as nothing
more than an economic price
charged by the owner of water (the state) for using its property.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If Chicago-School (and Rand
Corporation) economists were more
consistent in their ardor for the price system, and less consistent
in their anarchistic mistrust of legislatures, they would seize upon
this obvious application of the price system and boost it with all
the considerable influence they wield. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether one chooses taxation
regulation, we must control pumping
in some manner if any system of surface control is to work. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While California rations and
conserves surface water, landowners
in the arid San Joaquin Valley just punch more and more wells into
the aquifers and pump up free water the State keeps recharging at
high cost. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus they play out their destined
role in The Great Water
Treadmill: subsidized water supply followed by overdraft followed by
State rescue projects followed by new overdrafts, etc. ad bankruptcy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This treadmill got well started in
1913 when Los Angeles tapped
the Owens Valley waters to supply free water in the San Fernando
Valley. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The lands there were timely
pre-purchased by insiders, giving a
clue to the forces behind the premature seizures and diversion of
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The episode was dramatized in the
film Chinatown, so the scenario
is often now labelled 'the Chinatown syndrome' although the key names
like Mulholland, Otis and Chandler sound distinctly occidental. </small></p>

The legislative ethic
demands a prize, such as a university campus, in every electoral

excess floor space. Sacramento solves rising enrollment not with more

new ones, each to enrich influential land speculators.</small></li>

The high real cost of
serving new settlements is passed on to older settled areas through
an accounting device called "melding," stirring all the accounts in
the same pot. Melding passes through several levels: a state
wholesaler serves the metropolitan district, which serves local
districts, which serve cities. At the end of the line, in Riverside,
it costs society $1800 to serve the marginal acre-foot (a unit of
water) selling for $20. This subsidy is worth fortunes to developers;
the cost is spread so others won't notice.</small></li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Problems with French
Equity</b>
</small><br>
<small>There are two problems with these subsidies as an approach to
equity: they are not equitable, and they are wasteful. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equity
achieved by regional cross-subsidy is not interpersonal, but
interregional. It is like U.S. "foreign aid" programs, which tax the
poor in rich countries to aid the rich in poor countries.</span> Some
who
hold speculative land and enjoy subsidies are among the world's
richest people and cor-porations. Equity is not served by milking
middle-class neighborhoods to further enrich wealthy owners. "Public
works for private gain" is bad enough, but worse when profiteers are
already rich.</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>How about waste? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidy
creates waste in the amount of the
subsidy, almost by definition. </span>The New York Regional Plan
Association
estimates the social cost of creating a new lot on the urban fringe
at four times the lot's price (probably an underestimate). Why
develop a lot worth only one quarter of its cost? Because other
people pay the other three quarters. This process transfers ground
rent from areas of overcharge to areas of undercharge, but it
destroys much of the ground rent. To spread the surplus, we lose much
of it. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Has French Equity any merit? It
passed for a way to create jobs
when Keynes actually urged waste as a route to full employment. Those
ideas are now dormant, but we still do not understand the problem. If
we had to fire teachers or policemen each time a city extended
utilities to a campaign donor's raw acres, we would better sense the
true cost of public works for private profit.&nbsp; <span

TRED (Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development): <a
 href="../docs/tred.html">TRED 6: Government Spending &amp; Land
Values: Public Money &amp; Private Gain</a><br>
<b><i> </i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Billions of tax dollars are
spent
annually on government subsidy programs which are designed to help
certain groups, areas, and industries, and contribute to the general
welfare. Despite the good intentions of legislators, however,
analysts point to evidence that the programs are not only burdensome
for the taxpayer but often fail to do their intended jobs. Critics
find that major benefits go not to those whom the programs are
designed to help, but to others who can "capitalize" on them.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One major feature of the subsidy
benefit pattern -- unintended but
predictable -- is the capitalization of land values. The value of
land will increase when the benefits, chiefly money income, are
enhanced by government subsidization. When the land is sold, the
benefit of a subsidy which seems likely to continue will be captured
by the seller. Thereafter, tax funds that continue to subsidize a
program will not fully benefit those for whom they were presumably
intended, but the seller will have made a capital gain.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A&nbsp;classicc example can be
drawn from the experience of
federal farm programs. Taxpayers and consumers have been spending
billions annual to aid some farmers. In practice, of course, these
programs have often -- and intentionally -- reduced farm output and
raised consumer prices. The consumer-taxpayer is thus dealth a double
blow, in effect subsidizing an increase in his own food prices. Yet
the operating farmer, burdened with a higher land price, fails to get
the full benefits of the programs established for his welfare.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In farm programs, as in some other
subsidy programs, the expected
annual benefits are capitalized into higher land prices. Then, after
land prices have gone up to reflect these benefits, the annual
payments to farm operators in effect support the higher land prices.
In effect, the seller of land realizes the benefits of government
subsidy into perpetuity. A somewhat similar pattern is to be expected
in other public spending programs, including those concerned with
urban renewal, where benefits are localized. The pattern shows that
farm programs do not raise wages of low-paid farm labor, that urban
projects do not rid cities of slums, and that the taxpayer-consumer
bears the burden of both.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This volume explores, and at least
attempts to define, the extent
to which land values tend to capture the benefits of subsidies and
other government spending through capitalization. It includes papers
by proponents as well as critics. The contributors, who include some
of the nation's leading economists, discuss the nature and effects of
farm and housing programs, commodity price supports, transportation
outlays, land preservation projects, water resource development, and
urban renewal programs. Their work will be of more than routine
interest to economists, political scientists, lawyers, political
officeholders and government officials, planners, and all others who
seek to unravel the complex fabric of multi-billion-dollar government
spending programs.</small><small> </small><small> </small></p>

biases.</b> Identifying and eliminating tax biases to both extracting
and consuming energy, and other primary products. Whether on balance
these biases raise or lower prices to consumers is not known, but
neither is it relevant here: the point is that the combination raises
the total volume of extracting the primary products, and of course of
consequent combustion and pollution.
</small><small>The writer has identified many of these biases elsewhere
(Gaffney,
1978). Suffice it here to observe the following. It is not just that
a commodity like gasoline is subsidized; it is worse than that.
Within the stream of production, subsidies go to those activities
involved in extraction, while taxes fall on activities downstream
that conserve and economize on the primary product (Gaffney, 1982).

To tax rent we must be sure there
is rent to tax, and
we must adopt public
policies to husband and maximize it, and avoid policies
that lower and dissipate it.</span>
This covers the whole area of public spending, a vast
topic, so I will give just a few
pointed examples.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">i. Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cape Breton Island, the northern
tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ii. Avoid letting lessees of
public
land conceal
their revenues</span>. Many
minerals and hydrocarbons on public lands are leased
by private firms,
subject either to "royalties" or "severance taxes"
based on the value of
output. Many of these private firms are "vertically
integrated," meaning they
own the downstream firms, often in other countries,
to which they sell.
They grow skilled at shifting profits away from where
taxes are higher to
where they are lower, by rigging the internal
transfer prices. That is, they
sell to themselves at artificially low prices, so
your share of their revenues
disappears. What they call "world market" prices are
really their own
internal prices, adjusted to help them steal from
you. You must guard
against that.
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> iii. Avoid letting lessees or
taxpayers pad their
costs to understate
their net revenues</span>. When you let lessees or taxpayers
deduct their costs
(as you should) from the tax base, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">you must audit
those alleged costs to
be sure they are real and legitimate. Pay these
auditors well, and support
them: they will save you a hundred times what you pay
them.
</span></small><br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> iv. Avoid dissipating rent by
allowing open access to
resources like
fisheries</span>, which we have already discussed.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> v. Avoid trying to distribute
rents
to consumers by
capping prices
below the market.</span> This, of course, is the history of
energy prices in
Russia; it has also been used, in milder forms, in
Canada and the U.S.
What is wrong with it? In a word, it fosters wasteful
use, and aborts a lot of
economical production. In addition, it leaves a lot
of rent in private hands,
untaxed (see <a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">"D"</a>,
next below).
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>It is easy to understand the dire need for guaranteed fuel
in a northern continental
winter climate. You mustn't let people freeze, and they
will bless and support you
for keeping them warm. As society gets better organized,
though, you can gain by
guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
buy fuel and other
needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
free fuel that you might be
exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the
cash income from the
rents created when fuel prices rise, and have a lot more
to spare from the resulting
net gains, which I next explain.

<small>... If land holders can produce a higher return on investment by
not
using land for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher
price from those willing and able to pay the higher price in the
future, there is a flaw in public policy. Public policy thereby gives
speculative, nonproductive investment a higher return than productive
investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production and
distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from
public improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
reduce sprawl.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One example that I know is that of
a friend who bought land within
the city but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money
into an investment that had no visible return? He replied that, by
holding the land for future sale or development, his long term
return, in capital gains would exceed 18% annually. If he built a
building on the site now, his long term return would only be 12%
annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should he
use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use
it, but to hold it for a larger future gain?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most major cities have a
substantial amount of fully serviced but
unused or underused land sites. It is estimated that 38% of the land
area in Los Angeles is unused, 30% in New York City and 25% in
Washington, D.C. Intercity sites are bypassed because land
speculators receive a greater benefit by ignoring the highest and
best use of land sites. A greater profit is made when development is
delayed and the land price increases to higher levels. But building
within existing developed areas uses the existing and underused
infrastructure, roads, transit, public facilities, and services.
Sprawl requires new expenditures on public goods and services, more
government, more taxes, more dislocation. ... <a

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
    One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that
      nature can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private property
      rights. This line of thought is called free market environmentalism, and
      it&#8217;s favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute.</p>
  <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential paper
    by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960, Coase challenged
    the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation is the only way
    to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be protected through property
    rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined and the cost of enforcing
    them is low.</p>
  <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a polluter
    and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance, if the
    polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not to be emitted
    upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will come to a deal that
    reduces pollution.</p>
  <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
    air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid such
    potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a sum of money
    up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation for the inconvenience
    and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree on a level of pollution
    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given free
    to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of pollution
    is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. <strong>Taking the opposite
    tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
    Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common property
    and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</strong></p>
  <p>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property rights
    when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by everyone? It turns out
    this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s no
    textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
    I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
    Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
    In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
    different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new property
    rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a long time, it
    behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
