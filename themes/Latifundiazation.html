<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George, a
    themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with
    links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>
  <br>
THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or sewing machines,
thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows straining and striving
to bring up the little ones deprived of their natural bread-winner; the children
that are growing up in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions
in which only a miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn
them in advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they
die,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>because we permit them to be
robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a system which disinherits the
vast majority of the children that come into the world. There is enough and to
spare for them. Had they the equal rights in the estate which their Creator has
given them, there would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out
a mere existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put
bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we
may see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that are
deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization today. &#8212; <a href="George_TSNS.html">Thou

Economics as a Stratagem Against Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>In 1917, rural Georgism got a
third wind:</strong> the California
Legislature made it mandatory for all Districts to exempt
improvements (Stat. 1917, p.764, codified Stats. 1943, Ch. 368, Div.
10,11 [California Water Code]; Mason, 1949, pp.2,6; Gaffney,
1969). They then grew to include over four million acres by 1927, and
to dominate American agriculture in their specialty crops. They built
the highest dam in the world at that time (Don Pedro, on the Tuolumne
River in the Sierra Nevada), financing it 100% from local land taxes.
Albert Henley, a lawyer who crafted the modified District that serves
metropolitan San Jose, evaluated them thus: 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The discovery of the
legal formula of these organizations was of infinitely greater value
to California than the discovery of gold a generation before. They
are an extraordinarily potent engine for the creation of wealth"
(Henley, 1957, p.665, 667; 1969, p.140).</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They catapulted California into
being the top-producing farm state
in the Union, using land that was previously desert or range. <strong>They
made California a generator of farm jobs and homes, while other
states were destroying them by <span

</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this is a "minor"
phenomenon it is because the neglect of historians and economists has
made it so. One searches in vain through academic books and journals
on farm economics for recognition of this, the most spectacularly
successful story of farm economic development in history. What
references there are consist of precautionary cluckings focused on
attendant errors and failures. "Economic development" theorists
neglect it altogether, as though California's commercial farming had
sprung full blown from a corporate office, with no grass roots basis,
and no development period. It is as though the clerisy were in
conspiracy against the <span style="font-style: italic;">demos</span>,
under some Trappist oath against
disclosing what groups of small people achieved through community
action, and through the judicious application of the pro-incentive

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
        paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
        paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
        paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
        mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
        by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
        and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
        from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
        value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
        owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>  3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. </strong>(8.)</p>
  <p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
    to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
    of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
    you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others. You
    say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the earth
    does not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess
    the soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the
    land.</p>
  <p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
    of conscience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
        our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular,
        leaving the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I
        being the eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing
        so I have not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let
        them work for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would
        have had to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not
        be clear?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal
    sin, and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to
    make restitution and to do penance?</p>
  <p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
    land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
    supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a
    number of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly
    and prosper, you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership
    in the river, refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought
    it of them; and that thus they had become rich without work, while the others,
    though working hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly
    able to exist?</p>
  <p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
  <p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
    action:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby
        to minister to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does
        not
      drink of
        the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the river
      contribute their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all
      water is supplied
        either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry which
        is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for the
        water.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
    yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
  <p>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly depriving
    a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless
    he will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves
    his victim to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. But I would like
    to point out how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among
    private owners, ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks
    the largest facts.</p>
  <p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
    where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
    are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
    was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
    centuries has condemned it to desertion?<strong> History tells us. It was private
    property in land; <em>the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw
    that ancient Italy was perishing</em>; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop
    of men, let in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of
    Odin and Thor, and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the
    East shivered the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars
    of Mohammedan hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church
    of St. Sophia trampled the cross to rear the crescent!</strong></p>
  <p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
    tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
    sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
    are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
    you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
    they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Let any one who wishes visit this diocese and see with his own eyes
      the vast and boundless extent of the fairest land in Europe that has been
      ruthlessly
        depopulated since the commencement of the present century, and which
      is now abandoned to a loneliness and solitude more depressing than that
      of the prairie
        or the wilderness. Thus has this land system actually exercised the power
        of life and death on a vast scale, for which there is no parallel even
      in the dark records of slavery. &#8212; Bishop Nulty&#8217;s Letter to
      the Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Meath.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
    and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the
    growth of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the
    artificial scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem
    as if there is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</p>
  <p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
    private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
    the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
    the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you may
    see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet,
    that prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the
    midst of the earth.</p>
  <p>To the mere materialist this is sin and shame. Shall we to whom this world
    is God&#8217;s world &#8212; we who hold that man is called to this life
    only as a prelude to a higher life &#8212; shall we defend it? ...</p>
  <p><strong>  5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
      mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
      by Divine Law.</strong> (11.)</p>
  <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
    property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
    practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
  <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
    the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
    to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
    right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
    sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
    among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
    used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
    was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
    but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
    in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the
    Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
    by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
    fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
  <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the same
    right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor, has never
    grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery, it is the result
    of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
    whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
  <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of
    the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
    there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in
    land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. The
    sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of
    land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved
    duties or payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea
    that we would carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public
    uses. The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church
    lands defrayed the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief
    of the sick, the destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided
    for public defense and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion
    of the land remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free
    to pasture it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
  <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land is
    to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were rude,
    wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought
    of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which
    despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England, the highest
    authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that
    in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so helpless, so pressed
    and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth century;
    and that, save in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as
    to fear that his wife and children might come to want even were he taken
    from them. Dark and rude in many respects as they were, these were the times
    when the cathedrals and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite
    our admiration were built; the times when England had no national debt, no
    poor law, no standing army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands
    of human beings rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay
    their heads at night.</p>
  <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
    that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
    that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that
    the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in
    Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted
    in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and
    that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time
    all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners;
    while the same private ownership of land was extended over Ireland and the
    Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs.
    Even the military dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today
    have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses without one penny of other
    taxation.</p>
  <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is
    only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is
    due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large
    plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of
    slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
    English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
    manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of
    the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that land was
    to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established in English
    thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so treated by the
    United States and by the several States. And though land was at first sold
    cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also sold in large quantities
    to speculators, given away in great tracts for railroads and other purposes,
    until now the public domain of the United States, which a generation ago
    seemed illimitable, has practically gone. And this, as the experience of
    other countries shows, is the natural result in a growing community of making
    land private property. When the possession of land means the gain of unearned
    wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose,
    economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by
    the state for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands
    of users and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
    will be profitable only to users.</p>
  <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
    of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
    that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
    while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes
    the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
    civilization.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
    ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt not covet
    thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant,
    nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
    field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
    exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
    man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
    for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms
    referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. But
    the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and improvement, to
    which the right of possession and ownership does attach without recognition
    of property in the land itself. And that this reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is
    not a sanction of private property in land as it exists today is proved by
    the fact that the Mosaic code expressly denied such unqualified ownership
    in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the land also shall not be sold
    forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided
    for its reversion every fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive
    industrial conditions of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a
    foothold in the soil.</p>
  <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
    be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that justly
    attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated as the
    free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221; ...</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
      wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. </strong>(51.)</p>
  <p>The idea, as expressed by Arthur Young, that &#8220;the magic of property
    turns barren sands to gold&#8221; springs from the confusion of ownership
    with possession, of which I have before spoken, that attributes to private
    property in land what is due to security of the products of labor. It is
    needless for me again to point out that the change we propose, the taxation
    for public uses of land values, or economic rent, and the abolition of other
    taxes, would give to the user of land far greater security for the fruits
    of his labor than the present system and far greater permanence of possession.
    Nor is it necessary further to show how it would give homes to those who
    are now homeless and bind men to their country. For under it every one who
    wanted a piece of land for a home or for productive use could get it without
    purchase price and hold it even without tax, since the tax we propose would
    not fall on all land, nor even on all land in use, but only on land better
    than the poorest land in use, and is in reality not a tax at all, but merely
    a return to the state for the use of a valuable privilege. And even those
    who from circumstances or occupation did not wish to make permanent use of
    land would still have an equal interest with all others in the land of their
    country and in the general prosperity.</p>
  <p>But I should like your Holiness to consider how utterly unnatural is the
    condition of the masses in the richest and most progressive of Christian
    countries; how large bodies of them live in habitations in which a rich man
    would not ask his dog to dwell; how the great majority have no homes from
    which they are not liable on the slightest misfortune to be evicted; how
    numbers have no homes at all, but must seek what shelter chance or charity
    offers. I should like to ask your Holiness to consider how the great majority
    of men in such countries have no interest whatever in what they are taught
    to call their native land, for which they are told that on occasions it is
    their duty to fight or to die. What right, for instance, have the majority
    of your countrymen in the land of their birth? Can they live in Italy outside
    of a prison or a poorhouse except as they buy the privilege from some of
    the exclusive owners of Italy? Cannot an Englishman, an American, an Arab
    or a Japanese do as much? May not what was said centuries ago by Tiberius
    Gracchus be said today: &#8220;Men of Rome! you are called the lords of the
    world, yet have no right to a square foot of its soil! The wild beasts have
    their dens, but the soldiers of Italy have only water and air!&#8221;</p>
  <p>What is true of Italy is true of the civilized world &#8212; is becoming
    increasingly true. It is the inevitable effect as civilization progresses
    of private property in land.</p>
