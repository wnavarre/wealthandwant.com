<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Christianity has been used to reinforce
privilege ("private law" -- laws which benefit some at the expense of
others), but that does not appear to be God's intention.</div>

  <p>&quot;All things work together for good for those who love God&quot; --Romans
    8 -- could be construed as reinforcing whatever the current structure is.</p>
  <p>The lovely hymn &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot; has a verse we no longer

  Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Has it come?
Let this Christian
city of Glasgow answer &#8212; Glasgow, that was to &#8220;Flourish by
the preaching of the word&#8221;. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Day after
day, Sunday after
Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone
up; and today, in this so-called Christian city of Glasgow, 125,000
human beings &#8212; so your medical officer says &#8212; 125,000
children of God are living whole families in a single room. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; We have been
praying for it and
praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many
think it will never come. Here is the vital point in which what we
are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted
the seeds of a newer and a higher. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We have become accustomed to
think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? Is God indeed a self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might?<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There was a little dialogue
published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye! When a person sees that,
then there arises that hope of the
coming of the kingdom that carried the gospel through the streets of
Rome, that carried it into pagan lands, that made it, against the
most ferocious persecution, the dominant religion of the world. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Early Christianity did not mean,
in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.
If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? Why were its first professors thrown to wild beasts,
burned to light a tyrant&#8217;s gardens, hounded, tortured, put to
death by all the cruel devices that a devilish ingenuity could
suggest? Not that it was a new religion, referring only to the
future. Rome was tolerant of all religions. It was the boast of Rome
that all gods were sheltered in her Pantheon; it was the boast of
Rome that she made no interference with the religions of peoples she
conquered. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What was persecuted was a great
movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It struck at the very basis of that
monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily. </span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
That is the reason why early Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached.... <a

  <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
      Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
      Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which
        he finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the
        great majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
      <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
        sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
        necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
        than their share of labor on others.</li>
      <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
        things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and
        not as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have
        the exclusive right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that
        they may compel their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here,
        and that this exclusive ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet
        to come, with the same right of excluding their fellows.</li>
      <li>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that all
        men are children of God the common Father; that all have the same last
        end; that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature
        and the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except
        the unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! <strong>Yet
        in all this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
        of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
        and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
        give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
      made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
      gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
      that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the
      landlords. Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly
      say, &#8220;The priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share
      in all that is out of sight, but they take precious good care that the
      rich shall keep a tight grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

    Alanna Hartzok: <a href="../docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">Who Would Jesus Tax?&nbsp;The
    Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax
  Crusade</span></a> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
      for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
      Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
      church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
      incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
      while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less than
      $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been
      no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country.
      Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
    scene. ... </p>
    <p>Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes
      in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just 4.1
      percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of property
      taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes are among
      the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas, and do not exempt
      even the most basic necessities such as food. The state's 1901 constitution
      was written primarily by large landholders to secure their economic interests,
      consequently property taxes are
  extremely light on their holdings. ...</p>
    <p>While Hamill suspected she would be opposed by special interest groups like
      the Alabama Farmers Federation which represents big timber and agribusiness
      interests, she was not prepared for the attacks and underhanded tactics of
      the Alabama Christian Coalition under the leadership of President John Giles.
      <strong>While Giles agrees that tax relief
  to the less fortunate "is a noble thing" he says the care of the poor is the
  duty of private charity not of government and staunchly opposes
  tax increases.</strong> ... <a href="../docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read the whole article</a>    </p>
