  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slavery
    and its aftermath</span>    </div>
  <p>Once you've spent some time on this website, go back and re-watch the 1970's
    TV series <em>Roots</em>, particularly Part 6. It deals with the period after
    Emancipation. &nbsp;A.J.O. (below), said to be Mark
    Twain, could have been one of the scriptwriters!</p>
  <p>I was struck by this quote, provided by Bob Herbert in the <em>New York
      Times</em>    of 3/1/2007, in a column entitled &quot;<em>Slavery is Not
      Dead. It's Not Even Past</em>:&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-1">he sheer size of the phenomenon of slavery, which was
        woven into the very being of the early Americas, is not well known today.
        The historian
      David
        Brion Davis, in his book &#8220;<em>Inhuman Bondage</em>,&#8221; tells us:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;By 1820 nearly 8.7 million slaves had departed from
          Africa for the New World, as opposed to only 2.6 million whites, many
          of them
        convicts or
            indentured servants, who had left Europe. Thus <strong>by 1820 African
            slaves constituted almost 77 percent of the enormous population that
            had sailed
          toward the Americas,</strong>            and from 1760 to 1820 this
          emigrating flow included 5.6 African slaves for every European.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">For most of the time between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War,
      the United States was governed by presidents who owned slaves.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Intrigued, I explored further, and found this
    paragraph, in an article at  <a href="http://cattailmusic.com/Blues/BluesNotes/OriginalSin.htm">http://cattailmusic.com/Blues/BluesNotes/OriginalSin.htm</a>,
     referring to a March, 2004 <em>NY Review of Books</em> article by George
    M. Fredrickson:    </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;By 1820,&quot; Davis writes, &quot;...at least ten
        million African slaves had arrived in the New World, as opposed to a
        grand total of two
      million Europeans.&quot;        Immediately following this in his article,
      Fredrickson notes that &quot;the
        shocking fact is that by 1820, the two million Europeans had become twelve
        million, whereas the ten million Africans had left only six million descendants.
        No other set of figures so graphically illustrates the inhumanity of
        slavery and the slave trade.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now my own copy of David Brion Davis's <em>Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and
      Fall of Slavery in the New World</em> has arrived, and I want to share
      the first two paragraphs of the prologue:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">In 1770, on the eve of the American Revolution, African
        American slavery was legal and almost unquestioned throughout the New
        World. The ghastly
      slave trade from Africa was still expanding and for many decades had been
      shipping five Africans across the Atlantic for every European immigrant
      to the Americas. An imaginary &quot;hemispheric traveler&quot; would have seen black
      slaves in every colony from Canada and New England all the way south to
      Spanish Peru and Chile. In the incomparably rich colonies in the Caribbean,
      they often constituted population majorities of 90 percent or more. But
      in 1888, one hundred and eighteen years later, when Brazil finally freed
      all its slaves, the institution had been outlawed throughout the Western
      Hemisphere.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">This final act of liberation, building on Abraham Lincoln's
        emancipation achievement in the American Civil War, took place only a
        century after
      the creation of the first antislavery societies in human history &#8212; initially
      small groups in such places as Philadelphia, London, Manchester, and New
      York.<em> <strong>The abolition of New World slavery depended in large
      measure on a major transformation in moral perception &#8212; on the emergence
      of writers, speakers, and reformers, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century,
      who were
      willing to condemn an institution that had been sanctioned for thousands
      of years and who also strove to make human society something more than
      an endless contest of greed and power.</strong></em> [emphasis mine]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word &quot;land&quot; does not appear in the book's index, nor does the word &quot;sharecropping.&quot;
    But I am struck by the fact that in the 25 years after the abolition of
    slavery in America, there began to be <em><strong>anti-poverty societies</strong></em> in
    America. Wealthandwant.com is in their tradition.</p>

</p>
<p>Robert H. Browne: <a href="../docs/Browne_Lincoln_Men.htm">Abraham Lincoln
    and the Men of His Time</a> (about 1851), quoting Lincoln</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand to the
    plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is many man doing
    his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now a word more
    about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever they may be: We
    are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction of slavery or
    believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for years. We are called
    so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in derision, to abase us, and
    enable the defamers to make successful combinations against us. I never was
    much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I favor the best plan to restrict
    the extension of slavery peacefully, and fully believe that we must reach
    some plan that will do it, and provide for some method of final extinction
    of the evil, before we can have permanent peace on the subject. On other
    questions there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but now it
    would be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have on hand.<strong> But
    when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest content while
    oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home, his
      sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any man, corporation,
      society, or unfriendly Government, any more than the air or the water,
      if as much. An individual company or enterprise requiring land should hold
      no more in their own right than is needed for their home and sustenance,
      and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent management of
      their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted when it
      creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be held for
      the free use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long
      as they are so occupied.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the future.
      The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists,
      agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against it,
      with whatever force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and carried
      on as it can be by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and the titled
      and untitled senseless enemies of mankind everywhere.&#8221; </strong>... <a href="../docs/Browne_Lincoln_Men.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[05] </span>There is a  suggestive fact that must impress any one who thinks over the history  of past eras and preceding civilizations. The great, wealthy and  powerful nations have always lost their freedom; it is only in small,  poor and isolated communities that Liberty has been maintained. So true  is this that the poets have always sung that Liberty loves the rocks  and the mountains; that she shrinks from wealth and power and splendor,  from the crowded city and the busy mart. So true is this that  philosophical historians have sought in the richness of material  resources the causes of the corruption and enslavement of peoples.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural. Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights  of the citizen, and political organization always starts from this  base. <strong>It is as social development goes on that we find power  concentrating, in institutions based upon the equality of rights  passing into institutions which make the many the slaves of the few.</strong>  How this is we may see. In all institutions which involve the lodgment  of governing power there is, with social growth, a tendency to the  exaltation of their function and the centralization of their power, and  in the stronger of these institutions a tendency to the absorption of  the powers of the rest. Thus the tendency of social growth is to make  government the business of a special class. And as numbers increase and  the power and importance of each become less and less as compared with  that of all, so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond  the scrutiny and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of  warriors, or head man of a little village, can command or govern only  by common consent, and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his  fellows. But when a tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a  populous country, the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition,  become practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny  of his acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder  successfully to appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he  directs becomes irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as  power thus concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of  thought grows up which regards the masses as born but for the service  of their rulers.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. <strong>To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. </strong>That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

    (1889 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Aye! When a person sees
that, then there arises that hope of the
coming of the kingdom that carried the gospel through the streets of
Rome, that carried it into pagan lands, that made it, against the
most ferocious persecution, the dominant religion of the world. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Early Christianity did not mean,
in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.
</strong>If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? Why were its first professors thrown to wild beasts,
burned to light a tyrant&#8217;s gardens, hounded, tortured, put to
death by all the cruel devices that a devilish ingenuity could
suggest? Not that it was a new religion, referring only to the
future. Rome was tolerant of all religions. It was the boast of Rome
that all gods were sheltered in her Pantheon; it was the boast of
Rome that she made no interference with the religions of peoples she
conquered. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What was persecuted was a great movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. </span>The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human
equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
It struck at the very basis of that monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That is the reason why early
Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The failure

  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:

  <p>...For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must

    the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,

    to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
    rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
    wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
    go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
    those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land

  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p><strong>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</strong> (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    <strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
    of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law.</strong> (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p><strong>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</strong> (5.)*</p>
  <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
    Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
    by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
  <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
    it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
    as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
    To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land
    to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
  <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
    the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold
    it as his own private possession.</p>
  <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
    for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
    he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only
    to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he
    pleases.</p>
  <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for greater
    security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages in another
    form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
    be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
  <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
    for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country, in
    my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
    defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
    bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the
    people. By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children
    from parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the
    buying and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
    with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived
    sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of
    his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here
    is a poor widow; all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes,
    the earnings of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by
    freeing these negroes?&#8221; And because of this perversion of reason, this
    confounding of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
    of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation
    a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
  <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
    property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same
    error into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same;
    it is essentially the same. Private property in land, no less than private
    property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. They are
    different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
    ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
    God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
  <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
    man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
    master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
    to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
    Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
  <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
    of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
    neck.</p>
  <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor of another
    without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully as chattel
    slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
    enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
    of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil
    do the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves
    of our Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner
    of Europe in ruder times to demand the j<em>us primae noctis</em>? Does not the same
    last outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
    wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
  <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
    on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine enriched
    their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men, they gave
    land. And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no free land
    remains to which the landless man may turn, then without further violence
    the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property in
    land takes the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient.
    For under it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when
    not needed. He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when
    no longer wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as
    efficacious. This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English
    conquerors of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land.
    This is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World, not
    to Europe.</p>
  <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
    form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in more
    insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory
    of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior
    monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending
    into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery
    the same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
    of the other!</p>
  <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What shall
    your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they demand
    of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare that
    he bought them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical,
    shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
    his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing
    and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing
    of his wages and thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock
    and bettering his condition in life&#8221;?<strong> ...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>  5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
      mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
      by Divine Law</strong>. (11.)</p>
  <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
    property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
    practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
  <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
    the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
    to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
    right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
    sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
    among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
    used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
    was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
    but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
    in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the
    Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
    by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
    fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
  <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the same
    right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor, has never
    grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery, it is the result
    of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
    whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
  <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of
    the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
    there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in
    land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. The
    sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of
    land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved
    duties or payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea
    that we would carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public
    uses. The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church
    lands defrayed the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief
    of the sick, the destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided
    for public defense and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion
    of the land remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free
    to pasture it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
  <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land is
    to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were rude,
    wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought
    of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which
    despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England, the highest
    authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that
    in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so helpless, so pressed
    and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth century;
    and that, save in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as
    to fear that his wife and children might come to want even were he taken
    from them. Dark and rude in many respects as they were, these were the times
    when the cathedrals and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite
    our admiration were built; the times when England had no national debt, no
    poor law, no standing army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands
    of human beings rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay
    their heads at night.</p>
  <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
    that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
    that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that
    the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in
    Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted
    in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and
    that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time
    all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners;
    while the same private ownership of land was extended over Ireland and the
    Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs.
    Even the military dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today
    have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses without one penny of other
    taxation.</p>
  <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is
    only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is
    due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large
    plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of
    slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
    English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
    manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of
    the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that land was
    to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established in English
    thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so treated by the
    United States and by the several States. And though land was at first sold
    cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also sold in large quantities
    to speculators, given away in great tracts for railroads and other purposes,
    until now the public domain of the United States, which a generation ago
    seemed illimitable, has practically gone. And this, as the experience of
    other countries shows, is the natural result in a growing community of making
    land private property. When the possession of land means the gain of unearned
    wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose,
    economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by
    the state for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands
    of users and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
    will be profitable only to users.</p>
  <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
    of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
    that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
    while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes
    the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
    civilization.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
    ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt not covet
    thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant,
    nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
    field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
    exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
    man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
    for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms
    referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. But
    the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and improvement, to
    which the right of possession and ownership does attach without recognition
    of property in the land itself. And that this reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is
    not a sanction of private property in land as it exists today is proved by
    the fact that the Mosaic code expressly denied such unqualified ownership
    in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the land also shall not be sold
    forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided
    for its reversion every fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive
    industrial conditions of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a
    foothold in the soil.</p>
  <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
    be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that justly
    attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated as the
    free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221;<strong><font size="+1"> ...</font></strong></p>
  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p><strong>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</strong></p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
  <p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the
    community. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
      the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
    however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
    natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
    are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
    and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
    between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
    men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</p>
  <p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
    of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
    on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
    in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
    living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
    in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
    and one of the inferior animals? <strong>Our American apologists for slavery
    used to contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated
    the
    intent of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference
    that you assume to be natural is between men of the same race. What difference
    does nature show between such men as would indicate her intent that one should
    live idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor?</strong> If
    I could bring you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and
    one who
    is glad to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by side in
    your antechamber, would you be able to tell which was which, even were you
    to call in the most skilled anatomist? Is it not clear that God in no way
    countenances or condones the division of rich and poor that exists today,
    or in any way permits it, except as having given them free will he permits
    men to choose either good or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer hell.
    For is it not clear that the division of men into the classes rich and poor
    has invariably its origin in force and fraud; invariably involves violation
    of the moral law; and is really a division into those who get the profits
    of robbery and those who are robbed; those who hold in exclusive possession
    what God made for all, and those who are deprived of his bounty? Did not
    Christ in all his utterances and parables show that the gross difference
    between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s law? Would he have condemned
    the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction between rich and
    poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s intent?<font size="+1"><strong>    ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
    <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
      than their share of labor on others.</li>
    <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
      as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
      their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same
      right of excluding their fellows.</li>
    <li>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that all men
      are children of God the common Father; that all have the same last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the
      unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet in all
      this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
      of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
      and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
      give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
    made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
    gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
    that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
    Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
    priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
    of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
    grip on all that is within sight&#8221;?<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Let me again state the case that your Encyclical presents:</p>
  <p>What is that condition of labor which as you truly say is &#8220;the question
    of the hour,&#8221; and &#8220;fills every mind with painful apprehension&#8221;?
    Reduced to its lowest expression it is the poverty of men willing to work.
    And what is the lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8212; for
    in that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
    material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which constitutes
    poverty.</p>
  <p>Now what is the prayer of Christendom &#8212; the universal prayer; the
    prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is honored;
    that ascends from your Holiness at the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s, and
    that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian mother
    has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is, &#8220;Give
    us this day our daily bread!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Yet where this prayer goes up, daily and hourly, men lack bread. Is it not
    the business of religion to say why? If it cannot do so, shall not scoffers
    mock its ministers as Elias mocked the prophets of Baal, saying, &#8220;Cry
    with a louder voice, for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in
    an inn, or on a journey, or perhaps be is asleep, and must be awaked!&#8221; What
    answer can those ministers give? Either there is no God, or he is asleep,
    or else he does give men their daily bread, and it is in some way intercepted.</p>
  <p>Here is the answer, the only true answer: If men lack bread it is not that
    God has not done his part in providing it. If men willing to labor are cursed
    with poverty, it is not that the storehouse that God owes men has failed;
    that the daily supply he has promised for the daily wants of his children
    is not here in abundance. It is, that impiously violating the benevolent
    intentions of their Creator, men have made land private property, and thus
    given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a bountiful
    Father has made for all.</p>
  <p>Any other answer than that, no matter how it may be shrouded in the mere
    forms of religion, is practically an atheistical answer. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Forty years ago slavery seemed stronger in the United States than
      ever before, and the market price of slaves &#8212; both working slaves and breeding slaves &#8212; was
    higher than it had ever been before, for the title of the owner seemed growing
    more secure. In the shadow of the Hall where the equal rights of man had
    been solemnly proclaimed, the manacled fugitive was dragged back to bondage,
    and on what to American tradition was our Marathon of freedom, the slave-master
    boasted that he would yet call the roll of his chattels.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Yet forty years ago, though the party that was to place Abraham
      Lincoln in the Presidential chair had not been formed, and nearly a decade

<p>From a letter by George M. Jackson, St. Louis. Dated August 15, 1885. Reprinted

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;During the war I served in a Kentucky
        regiment in the Federal army. When the war broke out, my father owned
    sixty slaves. I had not been back to my old
        Kentucky home for years until a short time ago, when I was met by one
    of my father's old negroes, who said to me: 'Master George, you say you set
    us free;
        but before
        God, I'm worse off than when I belonged to your father.' The planters,
    on the other hand, are contented with the change. They say, ' How foolish
    it was in
        us to go to war for slavery. We get labor cheaper now than when we owned
    the slaves.' How do they get it cheaper? Why, in the shape of rents they
    take more
        of the labor of the negro than they could under slavery, for then they
    were compelled to return him sufficient food, clothing and medical attendance
    to
        keep him well,
        and were compelled by conscience and public opinion, as well as by law,
    to keep him when he could no longer work. Now their interest and responsibility
        cease
        when they have got all the work out of him they can.&quot;  </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our primary social
adjustment
is a denial of justice. In
allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
as material progress goes on. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is
the subtle alchemy that in
ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
destroyed; </span></small><small>that is bringing political despotism out of political
freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
anarchy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is this that turns the
blessings of material progress into a
curse. It is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and
squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads

grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little
children the joy and innocence of life&#8217;s morning. </small></p>

is Justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. Justice
that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice that

of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, think of it &#8212; is not land
monopolisation a sufficient
reason for poverty? What is man? In the first place, he is an animal,
a land animal who cannot live without land. All that man produces
comes from land; all productive labour, in the final analysis,
consists in working up land; or materials drawn from land, into such
forms as fit them for the satisfaction of human wants and desires.
Why, man's very body is drawn from the land. Children of the soil, we
come from the land, and to the land we must return.<b> Take away from
man all that belongs to the land, and what have you but a disembodied
spirit? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore he who
holds the land on which and from which
another man must live, is that man's master; and the man is his
slave. The man who holds the land on which I must live can command me
to life or to death just as absolutely as though I were his chattel.
Talk about abolishing slavery &#8212; we have not abolished slavery; we
have only abolished one rude form of it, chattel slavery. </span>There
is a
deeper and a more insidious form, a more cursed form yet before us to
abolish, in this industrial slavery that makes a man a virtual slave,
while taunting him and mocking him with the name of freedom.</b>
Poverty! want! they will sting as much as the lash. Slavery! God
knows there are horrors enough in slavery; but there are deeper
horrors in our civilised society today. Bad as chattel slavery was,
it did not drive slave mothers to kill their children, yet you may
read in official reports that the system of child insurance which has
taken root so strongly in England, and which is now spreading over
our Eastern States, has perceptibly and largely increased the rate of
child mortality! &#8212; What does that mean?
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Robinson Crusoe, as you know,
when he rescued Friday from the
cannibals, made him his slave. Friday had to serve Crusoe. But,
supposing Crusoe had said, "O man and brother, I am very glad to
see you, and I welcome you to this island, and you shall be a free
and independent citizen, with just as much to say as I have except
that this island is mine, and of course, as I can do as I please with
my own property, you must not use it save upon my terms." Friday
would have been just as much Crusoe's slave as though he had called
him one. Friday was not a fish, he could not swim off through the
sea; he was not a bird, and could not fly off through the air; if he
lived at all, he had to live on that island. And if that island was
Crusoe's, Crusoe was his master through life to death.

(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People do not have a natural
right to demand employment of another, but they have a natural right,
an inalienable right, a right given by their Creator, to demand
opportunity to employ themselves. And whenever that right is
acknowledged, whenever the people who want to go to work can find
natural opportunities to work upon, then there will be as much
competition among employers who are anxious to get people to work for
them, as there will be among people who are anxious to get work.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Wages will rise in every vocation to the true rate of wages &#8212;
the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and in
a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now beginning to
look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and more ignorant age.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I remember &#8212; this man here remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the men
who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
conscience of the north &#8212; I well remember, as he well knows, and all
the older men and women in this audience will remember, how property in
human flesh and blood was defended just as private property in land is
now defended; how the same charges were hurled upon the men and women
who protested against human slavery as are now made against the men and
women who are intending to abolish industrial slavery.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We remember how some dignitaries and rich members of the
churches branded as a disturber, almost as a reviler of religion, any
priest or any minister who dared to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth &#8212;
that there never was and there never could be rightful property in
human flesh and blood.</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, it is now said that people who protest against this system,
which is simply another form of slavery, are people who propose
robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," they have made
"Thou shalt not object to stealing." When we propose to resume our own
again, when we propose to secure its natural right to every child that
comes into being, such people talk of us as advocating confiscation &#8212;
charge us with being deniers of the rights of property. The real truth
is that we wish to assert the just rights of property, that we wish to
prevent theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Chattel slavery was incarnate theft of the worst kind. That
system which made property of human beings, which allowed one person to
sell another, which allowed one person to take away the proceeds of
another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the tearing of the child from the
mother, and which permitted the so-called owner to hunt with
bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s tyranny &#8212; that form
of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the command, "Thou shalt not
steal," has been vindicated; but there is another form of slavery.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We are selling land now in large quantities to certain English
lords, who are coming over here and buying greater estates than the
greatest in Great Britain or Ireland. We are selling them land; they
are buying land. Did it ever occur to you that they do not want that
land? They have no use whatever for American land; they do not propose
to come over here and live on it. They cannot carry it over there to
where they do live.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
you make upon it." <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we are
selling those foreign lords is not really land; we are selling them the
labor of American citizens; we are selling them the privilege of
taking, without any return for it, the proceeds of the toil of our
children.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
carriages, houses or much more food and wine. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">He has gained the power of taking for his
own a great number of these products of human labor.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. When a man who does no work can
get them, necessarily the people who do work to produce them must have
less of the products of human labor than they ought to have. ...&nbsp;<a

Labor<br>
</a>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have already referred generally
to the defects that attach
to all socialistic remedies for the evil condition of labor. I will
now, specifically, but briefly, refer to some proposals which have a
wide and strong appeal.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That the State should step in to
prevent overwork; to restrict
the employment of women and children; to secure sanitary conditions in
workshops; to regulate wages; to encourage settlement, and the
acquisition of land by working-men; and the formation of working-men&#8217;s
associations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tendency and spirit of these
remedial suggestions lean
unmistakably to socialism &#8211; extremely moderate Socialism it is true,
yet Socialism still. And how little may in this way be accomplished!</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A strong, absolute ruler might
hope by such regulations to
alleviate the conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our
times is toward democracy, and democratic States are necessarily weaker
in paternalism, while, in the industrial slavery growing out of private
ownership of land that prevails in Christendom today, it is not the
master who forces the slave to labor, but the slave who urges the
master to let him labor.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, the greatest difficulty in
enforcing such regulations
comes from those whom they are intended to benefit. It is not, far
instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce restrictions on
child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, Prompted by poverty,
misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters and teach
the children to misrepresent.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In speaking of measures for
improving social conditions, it
seems to us that in the teachings of morality is to be found the
highest practicality, and that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
question, What is wise may always
safely be subordinated to the question, what is right?</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But expressed moral truths are
deprived of all practical
meaning when accompanied by unjust sanctions as when the American
people, while they legalised chattel slavery, were accustomed to read
solemnly on every national anniversary the declaration which asserts:
&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal
and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What did this truth mean on the
lips of men who asserted that
one man was the rightful property of another man who had bought him,
who asserted that the slave was robbing the master in running away, and
that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive to escape, or even
gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was an accessory to
theft, on whose head the penalties of the State should be visited?
</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, consider
the moral aspect of the present condition of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is &#8220;the question of the
hour,&#8221; the question that is
filling minds with painful apprehension? Reduced to its lowest
expression it is the poverty of men willing to work. And what is the
lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8211; for in
that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which
constitutes poverty.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, what is the prayer of
Christendom &#8211; the universal prayer;
the prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is
honoured; that ascends from the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome, and
that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian
mother has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is: &#8220;<b><i>Give
us this day our daily bread!</i></b>&#8221; Yet, where this prayer goes up,
daily and hourly, men lack bread! Why?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Here is the answer, the only
true answer! If men lack
bread, it is not that God has not done His part in providing it. If men
willing to labor are cursed with poverty, it is not that the
storehouse has failed, that the supply He has promised for the daily
wants of His children is not here in abundance.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is, that, &#8220;impiously
violating the benevolent intentions
of their Creator,&#8221; men have made land private property, and thus have
given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a
bountiful Father has made for all! ...

nature of truth always to prevail over error where discussion goes on.</small></p>

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or sewing machines,

that are growing up in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions

vast majority of the children that come into the world. There is enough and to

given them, there would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out
a mere existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put
bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we

    the "vested rights" of landowners with all the superstitious reverence that
    ancient Egyptians looked upon the crocodile. But when the times are ripe

    One day, the Third Estate covered their heads when the king put on his hat.
    A little while thereafter, and the head of a son of St. Louis rolled from
    the scaffold. The anti-slavery movement in the United States commenced with
    talk of compensating owners, but when four millions of slaves were emancipated,
    the owners got no compensation, nor did they clamor for any. And by the time
    the people of any such country as England or the United States are sufficiently
    aroused to the injustice and disadvantages of individual ownership of land
    to induce them to attempt its nationalization, they will be sufficiently
    aroused to nationalize it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase.

  <p>IT requires reflection to see that manifold effects result from a single
    cause, and that the remedy for a multitude of evils may lie in one simple
    reform. As in the infancy of medicine, men were disposed to think each distinct
    symptom called for a distinct remedy, so when thought begins to turn to social
    subjects there is a disposition to seek a special cure for every ill, or
    else (another form of the same short-sightedness) to imagine the only adequate
    remedy to be something which presupposes the absence of those ills; as, for
    instance, that all men should be good, as the cure for vice and crime; or
    that all men should be provided for by the State, as the cure for poverty. &#8212; <em>Protection

  <p>ONLY a little while ago nations were bought and sold, traded off by treaty
    and bequeathed by will. Where now is the right divine of kings? Only a little
    while ago, and human flesh and blood were legal property. Where are now the
    vested rights of chattel slavery? And shall this wrong, that involves monarchy,
    and involves slavery &#8212; this injustice from which both spring &#8212; long
    continue? Shall the ploughers for ever plough the backs of a class condemned

    forward, and again be forced back. But once loosed, it can never again be

the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see: As
I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,

allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves.&nbsp; ... <a

A.J.O. [probably Mark Twain]: <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
estate and 100 slaves, all the land
about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
myself.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
work it for themselves, and be their own masters.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small> "But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your
proposals
about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
reasonable, would it?"&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
agree."&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
themselves. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep my
men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people's expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REJOICE! I AM CAPITAL AND I
EMPLOY PEOPLE!</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whereas it is not my capital
that does any of these things. ... </small><br>
<small>But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an
overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay.&nbsp; .... </small><br>
<small>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
debts. ... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
I that do it; it is that greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent --
and
get it. <b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
that chattel slavery is not the
only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
in the USA, the UK and Australia
understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of
privilege and power &#8212; captives of the current hegemony &#8212;
daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental question,
lest they, too, become ridiculed.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so the world continues to
wallow in this particular ignorance

    <p><font size="-1">Let us imagine a shipwrecked sailor who, after battling
        with the waves, touches land upon an uninhabited but fertile island.
        Though hungry and naked and shelterless, he soon has food and clothing
        and a house &#8212; all of them rude, to be sure, but comfortable. How
        does he get them? By applying his Labor to the Land of the island. In
        a little while he lives as comfortably as an isolated man can.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now let another shipwrecked sailor be washed ashore. As
        he is about to step out of the water the first man accosts him:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Hello, there! If you want to come ashore you must
        agree to be my slave.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The second replies: &quot;I can't. I come from the United
        States, where they don't believe in slavery.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't know you came from
        the United States. I had no intention of hurting your feelings, you know.
        But say, they believe in owning land in the United States, don't they?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Very well; you just agree that this island is mine,
        and you may come ashore a free man.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;But how does the island happen to be yours? Did
        you make it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No, I didn't make it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Have you a title from its maker?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No, I haven't any title from its maker.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, what is your title, anyhow?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, my title is good enough. I got here first.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Of course he got there first. But he didn't mean to, and
        he wouldn't have done it if he could have helped it. But the newcomer
        is satisfied, and says:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, that's a good United States title, so I guess
        I'll recognize it and come ashore. But remember, I am to be a free man.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you are. Come right along up to my cabin.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For a time the two get along well enough together. But
        on some fine morning the proprietor concludes that he would rather lie
        abed than scurry around for his breakfast and not being in a good humor,
        perhaps, he somewhat roughly commands his &quot;brother man&quot; to
        cook him a bird.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What?&quot; exclaims the brother.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I tell you to go and kill a bird and cook it for
        my breakfast.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;That sounds big,&quot; sneers the second free and
        equal member of the little community; &quot;but what am I to get for
        doing this?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh,&quot; the first replies languidly, &quot;if
        you kill me a fat bird and cook it nicely, then after I have had my breakfast
        off the bird you may cook the gizzard for your own breakfast. That's
        pay enough. The work is easy.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;But I want you to understand that I am not your
        slave, and I won't do that work for that pay. I'll do as much work for
        you as you do for me, and no more.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then, sir,&quot; the first comer shouts in virtuous
        wrath, &quot;I want you to understand that my charity is at an end. I
        have treated you better than you deserved in the past, and this is your
        gratitude. Now I don't propose to have any loafers on my property. You
        will work for the wages I offer or get off my land! You are perfectly
        free. Take the wages or leave them. Do the work or let it alone. There
        is no slavery here. But if you are not satisfied with my terms, leave
        my island!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The second man, if accustomed to the usages of the labor

        about the &quot;greed of capital,&quot; destroy as many bows and arrows
        as he could, so as to paralyze the bird-shooting industry; and this proceeding
        he would call a strike for honest wages and the dignity of labor. If
        he were accustomed to social reform notions of the namby-pamby variety,
        he would propose an arbitration, and be mildly indignant when told that
        there was nothing to arbitrate &#8212; that he had only to accept the
        other's offer or get off his property. But if a sensible man, he would
        notify his comrade that the privilege of owning islands in that latitude
        had expired. ...</font></p>

  <p><em><strong>c. The Law of Division of Labor and Trade</strong></em></p>
  <p>Now, what is it that leads men to conform their conduct to the principle
    illustrated by the last chart? Why do they divide their labor, and trade
    its products? A simple, universal and familiar law of human nature moves
    them. Whether men be isolated, or be living in primitive communities, or
    in advanced states of civilization, their demand for consumption determines
    the direction of Labor in production.67 That is the law. Considered in connection
    with a solitary individual, like Robinson Crusoe upon his island, it is obvious.
    What he demanded for consumption he was obliged to produce. Even as to the
    goods he collected from stranded ships &#8212; desiring to consume them,
    he was obliged to labor to produce them to places of safety. His demand for
    consumption always determined the direction of his labor in production.68
    And when we remember that what Robinson Crusoe was to his island in the sea,
    civilized man as a whole is to this island in space, we may readily understand
    the application of the same simple law to the great body of labor in the
    civilized world.69 Nevertheless, the complexities of civilized life are so
    likely to obscure its operation and disguise its relations to social questions
    like that of the persistence of poverty as to make illustration desirable.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">68. It is highly significant that while Robinson Crusoe
        had unsatisfied wants he was never out of a job. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong><em>e. Effect of Retaining Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>If society retained Rent for common purposes, all incentive to hold land
    for any other object than immediate use would disappear. The effect may be
    illustrated by a comparison of the last preceding chart with the following:
    [chart]</p>
  <p> There is but one difference between this chart and the chart immediately
    preceding. In that Rent is confiscated to private use, whereas in this Rent
    is retained for common use. All the labor force indicated with red in the
    first of the two charts would not more than utilize the space to the left
    and part of the adjoining one, which would elevate Wages to what, with the
    given labor force, could be produced from the poorer of the two spaces. After
    that, increase of Rent would not enrich land-owners at the expense of other
    classes; it would enrich the whole community.108</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">108. The laborer would receive in Distribution all that
        he earned and no more than he earned in Production; and that is the natural
        law.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In social conditions, where industry is subdivided and trade is intricate,
    it is impossible to say arbitrarily what is the equivalent of given labor.
    Hence no statute fixing the compensation for labor can really be operative.
    All that we can say is that labor is worth what men freely contract to give
    and take for it. But it must be what they freely contract to take as well
    as what they freely contract to give; and men are not free to contract for
    the sale of their labor when labor generally is so divorced from land as
    to abnormally glut the labor market and make men's sale of their labor for
    almost anything the buyer offers, the alternative of starvation. Laborers
    may be as truly enslaved by divorcing labor from land as by driving them
    with a whip.</p>

        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Another objection to taxing land value, which some find compelling, is that
      when the owner bought the land, he already paid the present value of all
    future rents, so taxing the land would be a double payment. But many who
    bought their
      lands in the past have enjoyed gains, often large, in the real estate value.
      Moreover, this is only a transition problem; once the tax is in place,
    a new buyer&#8217;s tax is offset by a lower price for land and lower mortgage
    interest payments. Such an argument would prevent the liberation of slaves,
    since slave
      owners also pay the value of future labor when they buy a slave. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>We still need to judge whether it is fair for only landowners to pay the taxes,
      rather than to spread the burden on all who get income or spend money or have
      wealth.<br>
      <br>
    Natural-law philosophers such as John Locke have reasoned that all human beings
    have a natural ownership right to their labor and the products of that labor.
    The fundamental equality of humanity means it is fundamentally wrong for some
    to take away the labor done by others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small> That notion
    is almost universally recognized today with respect to slavery, and some
    folks are beginning to recognize that the current tax
    system &#8212; which taxes our earnings and taxes how we invest or spend those
    earnings &#8212; also violates man&#8217;s natural right to the fruits of
    his labor. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>Critics of land value taxation claim that over time, there would be popular
      pressure to bring back the income and sales taxes. It is true that those owning
      valuable commercial land will always seek to lower the tax on land and shift
      taxes to labor and capital. It is also true that governments can ignore constitutional
      rules, and governments get overthrown. By this argument, the slaves should
      never have been freed, because slavery can always be restored. Women should
      not have been given the opportunity to vote, because that could be reversed.
      This is an argument against any reform and indeed against any action to improve
      your condition. (Why bother to work? You might lose your money, and it will
      have been for nothing.) This is ultimately a philosophical argument for the
      futility of any human action. </p>
  <p>But the fact is that there was a shift in public attitude about slavery, and
      most folks now believe it was morally wrong. It would be politically difficult
      today to reverse the equal rights of women to vote. Similarly, once there is
      a shift in public attitudes about taxing wages, the view that it is morally
      wrong to tax labor could be just as
    irreversible. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

Service of the United States Department of Agriculture released its

the
US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the

<br>
<small>Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the
suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
$582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the
land are Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon. ...
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic human need for food
and shelter requires access of labor to
land. With access to land people can produce the basic requirements of
life. Access to land provides an enabling environment for life itself
and thus meets the minimum requirement of love, meaning fairness in
human relations based on the fundamental equal right to exist. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
Land Problem in its two forms - the inequitable ownership and control
of land and natural resources and the treatment of land as a market
commodity - is the root cause of the great amount of human deprivation
and suffering from lack of the basic necessities of life.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">And
yet the human right to the earth is missing from the Bill of Rights,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Human Rights.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Democratic governance has not yet concerned itself with a "first
principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span>
The question of "Who Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question.
In venues when this question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The right to the earth has yet to be pronounced in human rights
covenants. Democracy is unclear, ethically weak, and on shaky ground
when it comes to the question of the right to the land and resources of
the earth. Democracy as presently constituted lacks this most
fundamental and basic human right - the equal right to earth. The right
to the earth is the great undiscovered revolution in both American and
global politics.&nbsp; ...</small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We must not forget that
mainstream
institutionalized Christianity once promulgated the doctrine that the
right of some humans to hold other humans as slaves was encoded in the
Bible.</span> After much struggle and centuries of suffering, it
gradually dawned on the majority of people that slavery was unjust and
it was abolished. A similar awakening regarding the land problem lies
in our future, hopefully the near future. The vision for a just land
ethic was held by several great sages of our own recent history. Their
statements could be useful to us today.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Jefferson</span> - The
earth is given as a common stock for men to labor and live on.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abraham Lincoln</span> - The
land, the
earth God gave to man for his home, sustenance, and support, should
never be the possession of any man, corporation, society, or unfriendly
government, any more than the air or water, if as much. An individual,
company, or enterprise should hold no more than is required for their
home and sustenance. All that is not used should be held for the free
use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long as
they are so occupied.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> - Our
primary
social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man to own
the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.
This is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is
extracting from the masses in every civilized country the fruits of
their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more hopeless
slavery in place of that which has been destroyed; that is bringing
political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon transmute
democratic institutions into anarchy. ... </small><br>

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>On first reading Henry George (<a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a>)
almost twenty years ago when doing research for this volume, I was
particularly struck by the similarity of his arguments, and even
analogies, to those of the fourth century Christian philosophers on the
topic of land ownership.[16]
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Henry George, the great American political economist and land
rights
philosopher (1839-1897), eloquently confronted the enigma of the wealth
gap in his masterwork <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty </span></a>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">set forth both an ethical and practical
method for holding and sharing the land as a sacred trust for all. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>He made <span style="font-weight: bold;">a clear
distinction between property in land and property in wealth produced by
labor on land</span>. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>He said that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> private
property in
human made wealth belonged to the producer and that the state should
not tax wealth produced by human labor.</span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George said:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To abolish these taxes
would
be to lift
the whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. The
needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory; the cart-horse and
the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship; the farmer's plow
and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be free to
make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, un-annoyed by the
tax-gatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, "The
more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!" the
state would say to the producer,</small><br>
</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>"Be as industrious, as thrifty,
as
enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall
not be fined for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before;
you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[17]</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>In an economic system such as ours which uses money as a medium
of exchange, land and resources come to have monetary value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In
asserting that the gifts of nature are common property and should be
equitably shared by all, George saw that in a just society the
ownership of land and natural resources would be conditional upon the
cash payment to all of a fairly assessed tax, or land rent, for the
exclusive right to God's gifts. Thus the collection of land rent for
the community as a whole would replace the taxation of productive
endeavors. Those with more and/or better located land would pay more
into the common fund, while those with little or no land would pay much
less or nothing at all.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>As George explained it:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>...the value of land is at the
beginning of society nothing, but as society develops by the increase
of population and the advance of the arts, it becomes greater and
greater. In every civilized country, even the newest, the value of the
land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear the entire expenses of
government. In the better developed countries it is much more than
sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place all taxes upon
the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds the present
governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount demanded
in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses and
rent advances.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The author of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Common Sense</span> was onto the same idea
when he said:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Men did not make the earth...It
is the
value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is
individual property...Every proprietor owes to the community a ground
rent for the land which he holds. - Tom Paine
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enormous sums are currently
accruing
as unearned income to a relatively few individuals, families and
corporations who are holding large amounts of land, very valuable and
well-located land, and natural resources as their own exclusive private
property.</span> These enormous land values and resource rents are also
accruing as unearned income to banks holding mortgages based on
exploitative compound interest rates. It may be of interest to note
that the word "mortgage" means "dead hand." Truly, when one must work
so many years of one's life to pay off a mortgage, one productive hand
is as if dead in terms of producing for oneself, as the labor of that
hand pays the mortgage. For the 33% of citizens (40 million people) in
the United States who are renters, there is not even equity ownership
to look forward to after a life of labor. For the more than three
million homeless people in American and the multi-millions who are
homeless around the world, what Henry George said in 1879 holds true
today:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Our primary social adjustment is
a
denial of justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and
from which other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a
degree which increases as material progress goes on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19]</span></small><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is the land ethic of
Old and New Testament prophets and Henry
George virtually the same, the policy approach of "resource rent for
revenue" also known as "land or site value taxation" has its corollary
in the approach called for by the ancient rabbis in their discussions
about the finer and little known details of Jubilee. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Had the land problem been addressed in the south after the Civil
War, a
more equitable distribution of wealth and overall prosperity would have
been the likely result. It can be instructive to review this earlier
effort to secure land rights in America.</small><br>
<br>
<small>On March 3, 1865, just weeks before the end of the Civil War and
almost
a year prior to the ratification of the 13th Amendment, the Freedmen's
Bureau was created by Congress. According to Section 4 of the First
Freedmen's Bureau Act, this agency</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>shall have authority to set
apart for
use of loyal refugees and freedmen such tracts of land within the
insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned or to which the
United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or
otherwise; and to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as
aforesaid there shall be assigned not more than <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">forty acres of such land</span>.&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Introduced into Congress by Thaddeus Stevens this portion of the
Freedmen's Bureau Act was defeated by Congress on February 5, 1866 "by
a vote of 126 to 36."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[34]</span></small> </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lands which had been distributed
to freedmen were reclaimed and
returned to the previous owners. There was to be no land reform for the
South. Northern industrialists feared that giving land to freedmen and
poor whites in the South could have led to similar demands for land by
the people in the North, which, if implemented, would assuredly have
greatly limited the supply of cheap labor available for factory work in
the industrial North.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Abraham Lincoln sounded a warning when he said in 1865:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Corporations have been
enthroned.... An
era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power will
endeavor to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the
people...until wealth is aggregated in a few hands...and the Republic
is destroyed.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
band-aid safety nets of the 1940s and
50s are unravelling and a new Gilded Age is upon us. The wealth gap is
growing. </span>Wages
for nearly everyone have stagnated or are declining. Ever escalating
land values push housing prices beyond the capacity of millions to
secure adequate shelter. Worldwide, a billion people live in degrading
destitution lacking basic needs. Local conflicts and global wars are
waged for control of land and natural resources. Tax funds that could
build a world that works for everyone instead are being directed to
biochemical weapons research, building space laser weaponry, and
neo-colonial warfare.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It has been said that the
only two
certainties in life are death and taxes and that the power to tax is
the power to create or destroy. </span>The story of the birth of Jesus
is on one level the story of a family on a long and onerous journey to
pay taxes imposed by the Romans upon the people of the land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We
urgently need to establish land tenure and tax policies based on the
deepest wisdom of the Judeo-Christian tradition - a truth based on the
perception of the unity of life, that all is created by God, and on the
realization of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the one humanity. The
privilege of holding large amounts of land or highly valuable land as
individual private property needs to be a conditional, not an absolute
right. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For justice to
prevail, the right to exclusive access to land must be granted only
upon payment of full and fairly assessed land value taxes and resource
rents.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have at hand a powerful solution and a way to secure<strong> a
world of
peace and plenty</strong>. We need to constitute democratic governance on the
firm foundation of equal rights to the land and resources of the earth,
an "earth rights democracy" which removes the burden of taxes from the
backs of those who labor and instead directs government to collect the
value of our common wealth for the benefit of all. A morally correct
form of taxation may not lead to everlasting life, but it WILL promote
and sustain the conditions for lives worth living on planet earth.</small>

Lindy Davies: <a href="../docs/Davies_Ownership.html">Ownership and
the Law</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
President Bush's announcement of his vision for an "ownership society"
met with thunderous cheers at the Republican Convention, and much
eye-rolling elsewhere. The Bush Administration would like to start by
encouraging private ownership of our retirement funds and our
health-care decisions. They want to get the heavy hand of government
out of such things and unleash the tremendous efficiency of millions
upon millions of Self-Interested Individual Actors, the husky,
brawling, broad-shouldered capitalism that made this country great.
Prosperity depends on the security of private property and the potency
of individual initiative! This is the self-evident truth that has been
obscured by Hollywood Socialists, Democratic Girlie-men and purveyors
of the Homosexual Agenda.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We should realize, however, that this is hardly a new initiative. It is
really just the latest wave of an argument that has raged throughout
the history of the United States, about just what -- if anything -- and
on what basis -- if any -- the government can require us to surrender
what we possess. There are some people out there -- and actually a fair
number, after all -- who don't view the Bush Administration's
privatization proposals as extremist at all -- but, rather, too soft.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Unfortunately, though, the law is not at all clear. Thomas Jefferson
fudged the topic in the United States Declaration of Independence,
inserting "the pursuit of happiness" where people expected the more
loaded term "property". The Bill of Rights, however, is strong on
property rights. It provides for security of "persons, houses, papers,
and effects," that "private property shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation" and that rights not specifically prohibited
are reserved to the states or to the people. In fact, the US
Constitution was so bullish on property that it provided for private
property in human beings, a principle made explicit in Dred Scott vs.
Sandford and many other cases. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Slavery was made unconstitutional by means of the 13th Amendment
in
1865. This, however, left much to be resolved, and the Congress had a
very difficult job -- perhaps, in strictly logical terms, an impossible
job -- in drafting Amendment number fourteen.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The 14th amendment reaffirms the rights of life, liberty and property,
and binds the states to the same due process and equal protection
restrictions as the federal government. However, it places the
Constitution's first limit on the right of property, stating that the
United States or any state shall not pay "any claim for the loss or
emancipation of any slave". This could be seen as somewhat fishy in
terms of the Fifth Amendment. After all the 13th amendment had taken
the slaveholders' property three years before. Had not the Supreme
Court ruled that slaves were property and had to be returned to their
owners, even if they escaped to non-slaveholding states?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Although it would have been impracticable (to say the least) to enforce
the Takings Clause to the tune of the market value of some four million
human beings, that was what the Constitution required the government to
do.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The next amendment to the Constitution following the Reconstruction
Amendments was another milestone in the debate over property rights.
The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, allows Congress to &#8220;lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived&#8221; -- contravening
the restriction of this practice that had been laid out in Article I.
The &#8220;from whatever source derived&#8221; part has been making people scream
bloody murder ever since. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The original advocates of the income tax (many of them Single Taxers)
sought to tax accumulation, not industry and initiative. They saw that
the massive concentration of wealth among a privileged few was harmful
to the nation, and they persuaded the states to accept a progressive
tax that would compel robber barons to pay for public goods while
letting entrepreneurs gain from their contributions to overall
prosperity. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">And yet, over
the years, a tax on income &#8220;from whatever
source derived&#8221; came, one loophole at a time, to be a tax on exactly
those productive, hardworking, middle-class people that it was designed
to help. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
In most people's minds, after all, land is the most solid and important
kind of property; in fact, the word "property" in general conversation
most often means "land". However, it has long been recognized that
sometimes privately-held land must be taken for public purposes. The
principle of eminent domain is not (particularly) controversial. If the
state wants to put a highway through your house, it must pay you the
fair market value of your property.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>
This decision was important because it extended the Takings doctrine
beyond physical seizure to the taking of value -- but it was also
relatively uncontroversial in that the state legislature had removed
all of the parcel's market value.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If government were to be held liable for every single action that took
away a portion of real estate value, it could scarcely do anything at
all. That might be how some of the most strident militia-folk would
like it. However, it would certainly not suit real estate owners in
general -- who, while they might not enjoy paying for government, do
benefit from the things that government does.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What the property-rights folks are forgetting (or disregarding) is that
if a piece of land has a market value, that means that the net benefits
conferred upon it by the community (which includes the government) are
greater than the net costs. Location value is far and away the most
important component of land value -- and location value is almost
entirely the result of services and infrastructure that the government
provides. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It's no accident that the issue of "regulatory takings" is such a stew
of contradictions. Indeed, the terms of the argument deny the
possibility of coherence (in much the same way as they did in 1868).
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is not the fruit of
human labor, and its value is not the result
of any actions taken by its owner. Therefore, private property in land
is an entirely different sort of phenomenon than private property in
the products of labor -- and as long as the law fails to recognize this
fact, it cannot hope to make sense of the issue of "regulatory takings".</span>
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It could be suggested that "the conditions of the grant" could, without
doing any violence to the secure right of private property, require the
payment to the community of the land's rental value, to cover the cost
of the community's expenses which, it turn, provide the land's value in
the first place. That would, of course, require a clearer definition of
the moral basis of property that the United States has ever been able
to come to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet -- think of
it for a moment -- what would have happened
if the original Bill of Rights had articulated the individual's
absolute right to property only in the products of labor -- and the
community's right to the community-created value of the land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It would have saved us an awful lot of trouble. True, the "slavery"
states would have balked at joining the union under those rules. But
under them, the nation would have been so prosperous that they would
quite soon have seen the advantage of joining. We would have avoided
the Civil War, and probably even World War I -- it is dazzling to think
about how different -- and vastly better -- our history would have
been, had the Framers taken the brave step of setting forth the moral
basis of property along these lines.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It's interesting that we use the word "own" to mean two different
things: the sense of possession, and the sense of personal
acknowledgment, as in "owning up" to one's responsibilities. The
relationship between the two was once closer than it now seems to be;
the word "ought" is an archaic past participle of "owe". As we consider
how to arrange our "ownership society", we'd do well to remember what
we "ought" -- and bring the two senses of the word back together.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="../docs/Davies_Ownership.html"><span

<small>What is the use of a theory of justice? A theory is an
abstraction. By itself, it can't make anything happen. But <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when a
theory of justice takes root in us, it modulates our emotional
responses to distributive outcomes. If you should come to realize
that the theory of justice to which you subscribe says that something
you thought you wanted to do is unjust, you will find that course of
action no longer so appealing. </span>If you come to a new realization
that
justice is on your side, you are likely to feel emboldened and ready
to persist despite obstructions.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If
you should come to the realization that justice requires of you
a course of action that you had not planned on, you will feel a pull
in that direction, and if you do not follow through, you are likely
to feel guilty.</span> If your theory of justice informs you that
another
person is treated unjustly, even a stranger, you are likely to feel
compassion for that person, and you may also feel a chivalrous
impulse to take up that person's cause and seek redress of the
injustice. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It

&nbsp;The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Human Slavery Once Generally
Accepted.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Slavery is found to have existed, as a social institution, in
almost all nations, civilised as well as barbarous, and in every age
of the world, up almost to our own times. We hardly ever find it in
the state of a merely passing phenomenon, or as a purely temporary
result of conquest or of war, but always as a settled, established
and recognised state of social existence, in which generation
followed generation in unbroken succession, and in which thousands
upon thousands of human beings lived and died. Hardly anyone had the
public spirit to question its character or to denounce its excesses;
it had no struggle to make for its existence, and the degradation in
which it held its unhappy victims was universally regarded as nothing
worse than a mere sentimental grievance.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other hand, the justice of
the right of property which a
master claimed in his slaves was universally accepted in the light of
a first principle of morality. His slaves were either born on his
estate, and he had to submit to the labour and the cost of rearing
and maintaining them to manhood, or he acquired them by inheritance
or by free gift, or, failing these, he acquired them by the right of
purchase -- having paid in exchange for them what, according to the
usages of society and the common estimation of his countrymen, was
regarded as their full pecuniary value. Property, therefore, in
slaves was regarded as sacred, and as inviolable as any other species
of property.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Even Christians Recognised
Slavery.</b>
</small><br>
<small>So deeply rooted and so universally received was this conviction
that the Christian religion itself, though it recognised no
distinction between Jew and Gentile, between slave or freeman,
cautiously abstained from denouncing slavery itself as an injustice
or a wrong. It prudently tolerated this crying evil, because in the
state of public feeling then existing, and at the low standard of
enlightenment and intelligence then prevailing, it was simply
impossible to remedy it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus then had slavery come down
almost to our own time as an
established social institution, carrying with it the practical
sanction and approval of ages and nations, and surrounded with a
prestige of standing and general acceptance well calculated to
recommend it to men's feelings and sympathies. And yet it was the
embodiment of the most odious and cruel injustice that ever afflicted
humanity. To claim a right of property in man was to lower a rational
creature to the level of the beast of the field; it was a revolting
and an unnatural degradation of the nobility of human nature
itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That thousands upon thousands of
human beings who had committed no
crime, who had violated no law, and who had done no wrong to anyone,
should be wantonly robbed of their liberty and freedom; should be
deprived of the sacred and inalienable moral rights, which they could
not voluntarily abdicate themselves; should be bought and sold, like
cattle in the markets; and should be worked to death, or allowed to
live on at the whim or caprice of their owner, was the last and most
galling injustice which human nature could be called on to
endure.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The World's Approval Cannot
Justify Injustice.</b>
</small><br>
<small>To arrest public attention, and fix its gaze effectively on the
intrinsic character and constitution of slavery, was to seal its
doom; and its death knell was sounded in the indignant cry of the
great statesman who "denied that man could hold property in man."
Twenty millions of British money were paid over to the slave owners
as compensation for the loss of property to which they had no just
title, and slavery was abolished forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

be a system of compensation, the one justifiable source of funds to
finance it is assets that have been acquired by appropriating or
buying land and then selling it. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The issue of compensation will be examined by considering some
idealized cases, identifying the principles they exhibit, and then
asking how those principles apply to the circumstances in which
modern societies are likely to find themselves.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">The
    Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
    Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Constitutions must be amendable,
to allow for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into
them. This impinges on the protection of expectations, including those
regarded as property. Protection of property rights is achieved by
constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators to
reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from
reflecting new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would
reduce the value of property. There have been times in the past when
moral development has compelled societies to change laws in ways that
reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot
guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the
value of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the
possibility of such moral advances, we should design constitutions that
permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting
legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution.</small></div>

3. The Possibility of a Right of Secession<br>
4. The Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities<br>
5. Power, Population and Process</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Three hundred years ago
virtually no one questioned the propriety
of slavery. Even John Locke, that most articulate advocate of human
freedom, invested in slaves. But over the course of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, amid extreme controversy in some times and
places, slavery was nearly eliminated from the world. With a bit of a
lag, a consensus gradually evolved among humanity that slavery was
wrong, indeed that no distinctions in civil rights based on race
could be justified. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two hundred years ago almost no
one thought that women should be
allowed to vote. Amid extreme controversy in some times and places,
they were granted voting rights. Now virtually no one argues that
women should be denied any rights that men have. We have not yet
arrived at a consensus about what equality of the sexes means, but we
are near a consensus that we should strive for it. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The next point to be made is that
it would not be reasonable to
expect constitutional changes that reflect new moral understandings
to be made as approximate Pareto improvements. It would have been
possible to end slavery in a way that made almost no one noticeably
worse off as compared to their expected utilities under slavery. It
would merely have been necessary to declare the slaves free, provided
that they made reasonable progress on paying debts to their former
masters equal to their market value as slaves, and that they used
their first earnings to buy insurance policies that would compensate
their former masters in the event that they died or became
incapacitated before they finished paying the debts. But such an end
to slavery would never have satisfied the impulse that pushed for its
abolition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ending slavery was not an issue of
economic efficiency or voter
preferences. Slavery needed to be ended because so many people could
not in good conscience participate in a legal system that enforced
slavery. If slavery was wrong, there was no basis for requiring
persons subjected to slavery to purchase their freedom. They had to
be recognized as unconditionally free. Others would need to bear the
loss from the fact that those formerly recognized as the owners of
slaves would no longer be allowed to appropriate the product of slave
labor. Who should bear the loss?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addressing this question, it is
helpful to employ ideas from
the theory of accidents. We now see that the perpetuation of slavery
was a moral accident. To reduce the likelihood of future moral
accidents, it is sensible to assign the costs of accidents to some or
all of the persons who could have prevented them. Costs might also
reasonably be assigned to anyone who benefitted from the accidents.
Among the prominent candidates for bearing the cost would be those
who captured people and sold them into slavery, those who bought,
sold and transported slaves, those who held slaves, those who passed
and enforced laws perpetuating slavery, those who bought products
produced with slave labor, those who sold goods to persons involved
in the selling or holding of slaves, etc. Anyone who received an
inheritance derived from slavery could be called upon to relinquish
it as well. Emphatically not on the list are the slaves themselves
and any person who came of age without an inheritance after slavery
ended. They did not cause slavery. Thus it was wrong of Britain, in
ending slavery in the 1830s, to compensate those who were
historically regarded as the owners of slaves with funds from general
revenues, and with a rule permitting them to work the slaves for a
few more years, during which many slaves were worked to death.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are particular advantages to
assigning the cost of the end
of slavery to those who thought of themselves as slave owners. It is
administratively more efficient than other possibilities, because in
means leaving the costs where they fall. More importantly, the idea
that slavery might be seen to be wrong, and that then the costs of
ending slavery might be left where the fall, provides a continuing
incentive for those involved in slavery to cease.</small></p>

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
The ethical case for taxing land is based on two premises.&nbsp; The
first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
controversial since the end of slavery, so I will simply assume that
this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Natural opportunities include not only land, but also water,
fish in
oceans and rivers, the frequency spectrum, minerals, virgin forests,
and geosynchronous orbits.&nbsp; Some natural opportunities, such as
the opportunity to use the oceans for transport, are most valuable to
people when all are allowed to use them as they wish.&nbsp; (This does
not imply that their value is greatest when all can pollute as they
wish.)&nbsp; Other natural opportunities, such as most plots of land,
are most valuable when one person has exclusive use of them. ... <a

<small>How would the world look if its political institutions were
shaped by the conception of social justice advanced by Henry
George?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was one of the most
famous reformers of the late 19th
century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b>, his ideas have inspired people working for
economic and social reform all around the world. He is most famous
for proposing the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the
value of land. But I will argue that the single tax on land was not
George's most important contribution, and that the power of his
thinking can be best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social
justice that he used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>First I will argue that George's
theory of social justice provides
the dramatic climax as well as the logical foundation of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, I will discuss the functions
of a theory of justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then I will address the question
of what George's theory of social
justice implies for relations among nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Finally, I will ask what
constitutes justice within nations, in a
world where relations among nations are governed by George's theory
of social justice. ... 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.
Social Justice as the Climax and Logical Foundation of Progress and
Poverty</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While George wrote a number of
books -- the precise number depends
on how you count -- the most powerful statement of his ideas is
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, a volume that he divided into ten
Books.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The work is in part a restatement of economic theory,
(Books I, III and IV),</small></li>
  <li><small>part an examination of the causes of and proposed cures
for persistent widespread poverty (Books II, V, and VI),</small></li>
  <li><small>part a brief for curing poverty and the unacceptable
distribution of wealth by eliminating all taxes except a tax on the
value of land (Books VII, VIII and IX), and</small></li>
  <li><small>part a theory of human progress (Book X).</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I believe that the most
significant lasting impact of Progress and
Poverty will come from the conception of justice in Chapter 1 of Book
VII, a chapter titled "<b>The Injustice of Private Property in
Land</b>." From a dramatic perspective, this chapter is the cenptral
component of the climax of the work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The climax begins with the second
of the two chapters of Book VI.
In the first chapter of Book VI, George analyzes six different
proposed remedies for persistent poverty and explains why they are
inadequate. In the second chapter, which consists of just three
pages, he asserts that the only effective remedy for the relief of
poverty and the unacceptable distribution of wealth is to "<b>make
land common propert</b>y."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's choice of words here may
have been unnecessarily
inflammatory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When people see this phrase, they
generally presume that George
was proposing public ownership of land. In fact he rejected public
ownership of land. What he actually meant was that we must recognize
that land is everyone's common heritage, and we must develop
institutions that reflect this. In any case, he recognized that his
assertion would sound outrageous to many of his readers, and he
promises to defend it:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small><i>The laws of the universe are harmonious. And if
the remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be
consistent with justice; it must be practical of application; it must
accord with the tendencies of social development and must harmonize
with other reforms.</i> </small>
    <p><small><i>All this I propose to show.</i></small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Accordingly, Book VII is concerned
with the justice of making land
common property, Book VIII deals with the method and practicality of
making land common property -- not by public ownership of land, but
by abolishing other taxes and financing government by public
collection of the rent of land, and Book IX explores economic
consequences of this remedy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The first chapter of Book VII thus
plays the crucial role of
overcoming the reader's inclination toward knee-jerk rejection of
George's startling idea. And George is prepared with a theory of
justice in powerful language:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>What constitutes the
rightful basis of property? What is it that enables a man justly to say
of a thing, "It is mine!" From what springs the sentiment which
acknowledges his exclusive right against all the world? Is it not,
primarily, the right of a man to himself, to the use of his own powers,
to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own exertions? Is it not this
individual right, which springs from and is testified to by the natural
facts of individual organization</i> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><font
 style="font-style: italic;" size="+2"><small><small>--</small></small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic;">the fact that each particular pair of
hands obey a particular
brain and are related to a particular stomach; the fact that each man
is a definite, coherent, independent whole</span><font
 style="font-style: italic;" size="+2"><small><small><small>--</small></small></small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic;">which alone justifies individual
ownership? As a
man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete form
belongs to him. </span>  </small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
George then argues that if ownership is derived from
labor, then no one can own land, since no one produced it:
</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>This right of
ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility of any other
right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the produce of
his own labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of
someone else from whom the right has passed to him. If production give
to the producer the right to exclusive possession and enjoyment, there
can rightfully be no exclusive possession and enjoyment of anything not
the production of labor, and the recognition of private property in
land is a wrong.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 80px;"><small>If we are all
here by the equal permission of the creator, we are
all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty<font size="+1"><small><b> -- </b></small></font>with an equal
right to
the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every
human being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance
in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There
is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth
no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive ownership in
land. If all existing men were to unite to grant away their equal
rights, they could not grant away the right of those who follow
them.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To summarize George's rights-based
theory of justice: Each person
has an exclusive right to his or her productive powers. We understand
this intuitively, and on this basis accept the idea that people own
what they produce. But if this is what ownership means, then no one
can claim to own land, since no one produced it. People do have
rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers, which are
here for our use, but the rights of each person are limited by the
equal rights of all other persons.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A careful analyst might object
that there are some logical gaps in
George's theory of justice. Logically, a right of ownership of things
based on the right of each person to his or her productive powers
does not preclude a right of ownership of natural opportunities on
some other basis. We could mean by ownership only those rights that
are derived from the right of each person to his or her productive
powers, but we could also mean something broader and more
complex.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The easiest way to repair this gap
in George's theory is to
specify that rather than having just one axiom, that each person has
a right to his or her productive powers, he actually has two, the
second one being that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A second logical gap occurs when
George asserts that because
people have rights to their productive powers, they own what they
produce. This would follow only if they also had rights to the
natural opportunities that they appropriate in the process of
production. It is possible that the natural resources component of
what a person produces is more than his share, considering the equal
rights of everyone to all that nature offers. This caveat can be
conceded without jeopardizing the two axioms, that each person has an
exclusive right to his or her productive powers, and all persons have
equal rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This pair of axioms is the logical
starting point of George's
ideas. His proposal for the abolition of all taxes except a tax on
land is a consequence that follows from them. Coercive taxes on the
act of producing or on income from productive effort are unjust
because people have rights to their productive powers. On the other
hand, taxes on the rental value that land would have if it were not
improved are not unjust, since this value is not produced by human
effort. Support of government spending from this source is a
convenient way of giving expression to the equal rights of all to
natural opportunities.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>V. Differences in
Ability and in Wealth</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a nation appropriates
only its share of natural
opportunities but is richer than other nations because its citizens
are, on average, more highly talented or harder working than the
citizens of other nations. Does justice require the richer nation to
compensate the others? By Henry George's theory of social justice,
definitely not! Each person has an exclusive right to his or her
productive powers. Therefore the nation as a whole has a right to the
product of its citizens' talents, no matter how greatly this product
exceeds that of the citizens of other nations. The citizens of a rich
nation may feel compassion for those who are poorer than themselves,
and therefore contribute to poor nations as a matter of charity, but
justice does not compel them to do so.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What about a greater income that
arise from greater wealth? This
requires more elaborate analysis. When greater wealth is the result
of greater saving from the product of talent or from the product of a
nation's share of natural opportunities, then a nation with greater
wealth is fully entitled to the greater income that comes from it.
However, when greater wealth is the result of a history of theft or
of unjustifiably large appropriations from the natural opportunities
that are everyone's common heritage, then the nation that possesses
that wealth cannot rightly claim either the income from the wealth or
the wealth itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To achieve justice, the wrongful
appropriations must be rectified.
The unjustly acquired wealth must be restored from those from whom it
was taken, or if that is not possible, shared among all nations. To
the extent that persons who are still alive received past income from
this wealth, that income must be disgorged.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
When George addressed this issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span>,
he suggested that all such past misappropriations be forgiven, that the
generation whom he addressed be content to receive their shares of
future rent. But the desirability of such a policy is a matter that the
dispossessed of any era must decide for themselves. Justice does not
require them to forego such rectification.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Only if we have a standard of
justice that is independent of
history can we expect to end such actions. Henry George's theory of
economic justice -- that every persons his a right to his or her
productive powers, and that all persons have equal rights to all
natural opportunities -- provides a simple formula around which
opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can coalesce. This may
seem hopelessly optimistic. But no other theory that I have seen has
anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this theory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The theory needs a simple name.
I suggest calling this theory,
this perspective on social justice the Geoliberal perspective</b>.
Liberal for its commitment to individual liberty. Geo- for its
attention to land, for its planetary perspective, and for its
reliance on the ideas of George. If you like these ideas, I invite
you call yourself a geoliberal. I invite you to help me work out its
implications, to explain geoliberalism to others, and develop a
public dialogue about its value and implications. As Henry George
said, "Until there be correct thought, there cannot be right action;
and when there is correct thought, right action WILL follow."&nbsp;</small>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Scarcity of employment" is a
comparatively new complaint in the United States. In our earlier times
it was never heard of or thought of. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There
was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side of the
Atlantic the trouble -- so it was deemed by a certain class -- was
"scarcity of labor." It was because of this "scarcity of labor " that
negroes were imported from Africa and indentured apprentices from the
Old Country, that men who could not pay their passage sold their labor
for a term of years to get here, and that that great stream of
immigration from the Old World that has done so much to settle this
continent set in. </span>Now, why was there "scarcity of employment"
on one side of the Atlantic and "scarcity of labor" on the other? What
was the cause of this difference, of which all other social and
political differences were but consequences? Adam Smith saw it, and in
his "Wealth of Nations" states it, but it did not need an Adam Smith
for that, as everyone who knew anything of the two countries knew it.
It was, that in this country land was cheap and easy to get, while in
Europe land was dear and hard to get. Land has been steadily growing
dear in the United States, and as a consequence we hear no longer of
"scarcity of labor." We hear now of "scarcity of employment."</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the first quarter of this century an educated and thoughtful
Englishman, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, visited this country. He saw its
great resources, and noted the differences between the English-speaking
society growing up here and that to which he had been used. Viewing
everything from the standpoint of a class accustomed to look on the
rest of mankind as created for their benefit, 'what he deemed the great
social and economic disadvantage of the United States was "the scarcity
of labor." It was to this he traced the rudeness of even what he styled
the upper class, its want of those refinements, enjoyments, and
delicacies of life common to the aristocracy of England. How could an
English gentleman emigrate to a country where labor was so dear that he
might actually have to black his own boots; so dear that even the
capitalist might have to work, and no one could count on a constant
supply ready to accept as a boon any opportunity to perform the most
menial, degrading, and repulsive services? Mr. Wakefield was not a man
to note facts without seeking their connection. He saw that this
"scarcity of labor" came from the cheapness of land where the vast area
of the public domain was open for settlement at nominal prices. A man
of his class and time, without the slightest question that land was
made to be owned by landlords, and laborers were made to furnish a
supply of labor for the upper classes, he was yet a man of imagination.
He saw the future before the English-speaking race in building up new
nations in what were yet the waste spaces of the earth. But he wished
those new nations to be socially, politically, and economically newer
Englands; not to be settled as the United States had been, from the
"lower classes" alone, but to contain from the first a proper
proportion of the "upper classes" as well. He saw that "scarcity of
employment" would in time succeed "scarcity of labor" even in countries
like the United States by the growth of speculation in land; but he did
not want to wait for that in the newer Britains which his imagination
pictured. He proposed at once to produce such salutary "scarcity of
employment " in new colonies as would give cheap and abundant labor, by
a governmental refusal to sell public land, save at a price so high as
to prevent the poorer from getting land, thus compelling them to offer
their labor for hire.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This was the essential part of what was once well known as the
Wakefield plan of colonization. It is founded on a correct theory. In
any country, however new and vast, it would be possible to change
"scarcity of labor" into "scarcity of employment" by increasing the
price put on the use of land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If
three families settled a virgin continent, one family could command the
services of the others as laborers for hire just as fully as though
they were its chattel slaves, if it was accorded the ownership of the
land and could put its own price on its use. Wakefield proposed only
that land should be held at what he called "a sufficient price" -- that
is, a price high enough to keep wages in new colonies only a little
higher than wages in the mother-country, and to produce not actual
inability to get employment on the part of laborers, but only such
difficulty as would keep them tractable, and ready to accept what from
his standpoint were reasonable wages.</span> Yet it is evident that it
would only require a somewhat greater increase in the price of land to
go beyond this point and to bring about in the midst of abundant
natural opportunities for the employment of labor, the phenomena of
laborers vainly seeking employment. Now, in the United States we have
not attempted to create "scarcity of employment" by Wakefield's plan.
But we have made haste by sale and gift to put the public domain in the
hands of private owners, and thus allowed speculation to bring about
more quickly and effectually than he could have anticipated, more than
Wakefield aimed at. The public domain is now practically gone; land is
rising to European prices, and we are at last face to face with social
difficulties which in the youth of men of my time we were wont to
associate with "the effete monarchies of the Old World." Today, as the
last census reports show, the majority of American farmers are
rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form of tenancy;
and the great majority of our people are landless men, without right to
employ their own labor and without stake in the land they still
foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why the army of
the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has already
become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous type the
proletarian of ancient Rome.&nbsp; </small><small><a

of Wealth Harm America</small></a><a

(excerpt from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp;
</small></a><small>(1883)</small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rise in the United States of
monstrous fortunes, the
aggregation of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations,
necessarily
implies, the loss by the people of governmental control. Democratic
forms may be maintained, but there can be as much tyranny and
misgovemment under democratic forms as any other -- in fact, they lend
themselves most readily to tyranny and misgovernment. Forms count for
little. The Romans expelled their kings, and continued to abhor the
very name of king. But under the name of Caesars and Imperators, that
at first meant no more than our "Boss," they crouched before tyrants
more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of
"bosses," developed political Caesars in municipalities and states.
If this development continues, in time there will come a national
boss. We are young; but we are growing. The day may arrive when the
"Boss of America" will be to the modem world what Caesar was to the
Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic government in
more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
something like equality -- where the great mass of citizens are
personally free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty
nor made subject by their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in
a property qualification. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The man who
is dependent on a master for
his living is not a free man. To give the suffrage to slaves is only
to give votes to their owners. That universal suffrage may add to,
instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we see when
mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the
freedom to vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican
institutions be secured. How can a man be said to have a country
where he has no right to a square inch of soil; where he has nothing
but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must bid against his fellows
for the privilege of using them? </span>When it comes to voting
tramps, some
principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme. I
have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the
almshouse to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the
interest of good government. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Beneath all political problems
lies the social problem of the
distribution of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize,
and they listen to quacks who propose to cure the symptoms without
touching the disease. "Let us elect good men to office," say the
quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds by sprinkling salt on their
tails! &nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
In the full blaze of the nineteenth century, when every child in our
schools may know as common truths things of which the Egyptian sages
never dreamed; when the earth has been mapped and the stars have been
weighed; when steam and electricity have been pressed into our service,
and science is wresting from nature secret after secret &#8211; it is but
natural to look back upon the wisdom of three thousand years ago as an
adult looks back upon the learning of a child.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And yet, for all this wonderful increase of knowledge, for all
this enormous gain of productive power, where is the country in the
civilised world in which today there is not want and suffering &#8211; where
the masses are not condemned to toil that gives no leisure, and all
classes are not pursued by a greed of gain that makes life an ignoble
struggle to get and to keep? Three thousands years of advances, and
still the moan goes up: "They have made our lives bitter with hard
bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service!" Three
thousand years of advances! and the piteous voices of little children
are in the moan.</small></div>

our promised land &#8211; no narrow strip between the mountains and

with vaster knowledge and fuller experience, we are building up a
nation that leads the van of modern progress. And yet while we prate
of the rights of humanity there are already many among us thousands
who find it difficult to assert the first of natural rights &#8211;
the right to earn an honest living; thousands who from time to time
must accept of degrading charity or starve. </small></p>

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Hence it becomes important,
critically important, to understand the
meaning of &#8220;ownership&#8221; and &#8220;property&#8221; in the Georgist lexicon. But it
is not difficult, for they continue to have their classical meanings,
just as for John Locke, Adam Smith, and all the major forerunners and
thinkers of classical economics until the advent of neoclassical
economics. What was the meaning of ownership and property in their
classical sense? Property was the product of human labor and capital,
and that alone. Items of property were household goods, personal
attire, armaments, and similar such goods. Property belonged in the
category of capital. Land was not part of property, but rather was its
own category. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land, broadly defined,
belonged to everyone and was the common heritage of all humanity.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">15</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> One could no more &#8220;own&#8221; land than one
could own water, air, or other parts of nature, at least in the sense
of ownership that people often use today.</span> Much like the
native-American concept of ownership, it was part of what was
classically called &#8220;the commons.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> &#8220;What
is this you call property?&#8221; Massasoit, a leader of the Wampanoag, asked
the Plymouth colonists whom he had befriended in the 1620s. &#8220;It cannot
be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children,
beasts, birds, fish, and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on
it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all. How can one man say
it belongs to him?&#8221; <small><span

<p>  Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Landownership imparts superior
    bargaining power</span><br>
    Labor starves, in contests of endurance; land endures. <br>
    <br>
    A landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she can earn
      income like any worker.&nbsp; Landownership gives income above that,
      which gives discretionary spending or waiting power.<br>
    <br>
    In contests with capital, land has the greater waiting power because
      over time capital depreciates, while land appreciates.&nbsp; Thus
      landowners (when free of heavy taxation) are noted for their
      patience.&nbsp; Patience is the essence of bargaining power.<br>
    <br>
    Because land is fixed, more ownership by one person or group means less
      ownership by others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt, unavoidably.&nbsp;
    Thus, the expanding agent necessarily weakens others by the same stroke
      that strengthens himself.&nbsp; Landownership often gives market power
      in the sale of specific commodities and services.
