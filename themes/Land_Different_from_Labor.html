Different from Labor</span><br>

<br>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If Adam, when he got out of
Eden, had sat down and commenced to
pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
forth by labour. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labour we
shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labour and to nothing
else. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it happens that all over the
civilised world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
forth. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Read

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Being created individuals, with
individual wants and powers, men are individually entitled (subject of
course to the moral obligations that arise from such relations as that
of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment of the
results.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things
produced by labor &#8211; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of
which to deprive him without his will is theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This right of property, originating in the right of the
individual to himself, is the only full and complete right of property.
It attaches to things produced by labor, but cannot attach to things
created by God.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean, he acquires a right
of property in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale
or gift. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean,
so that he may sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Or, if he set up a windmill, he acquires a right of property in
the things such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim
a right of property in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or
forbid others to use it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Or, if he cultivate grain, he acquires a right of property in
the grain his labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right
of property in the sun which ripened it or the soil in which it grew.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For these things are of the
continuing gifts of God to all
generations of men, which all may use, but none may claim as his alone.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To attach to things created by God
the same right of private
ownership that justly attaches to things produced by labor is to
impair and deny the true rights of property. For a man who out of the
proceeds of his labor is obliged to pay another man far the use of
ocean or air or sunshine or soil &#8211; all of which are involved in the
single term &#8220;land&#8221; &#8211; is in this deprived of his rightful property; and
thus robbed.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/WoL.htm"> <span

<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The  Land
    Question</a> (1881)<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"> </a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine
    a little world swimming in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings.
    Let them divide the land, share and share alike, as individual property.
    At first, while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and primitive,
    this will work well enough.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment,
    let time pass, and look again. Some families will have died out, some have
    greatly multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased,
    and even supposing there have been no important inventions or improvements
    in the productive arts, the increase in population, by causing the division
    of labor, will have made industry more complex. During this time some of
    these people will have been careless, generous, improvident; some will have
    been thrifty and grasping. Some of them will have devoted much of their powers
    to thinking of how they themselves and the things they see around them came
    to be, to inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe
    beyond their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
    pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and trees
    and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and fishes and insects &#8211; to
    the doing, in short, of all the many things which add so largely to the sum
    of human knowledge and human happiness, without much or any gain of wealth
    to the doer. Others again will have devoted all their energies to the extending
    of their possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this
    time treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
    equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more than
    one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very many will
    have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this, our little island
    or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are no wars or robberies;
    that the government is absolutely pure and taxes nominal; suppose, if you
    want to, any sort of a currency; imagine, if you can imagine such a world
    or island, that interest is utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership
    of land will have produced poverty and virtual slavery.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For the
      people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to say, in their
      physical natures at least, they are animals who can live only on land and
      by the aid of the products of land.</span> They may make machines which
      will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps to fly in the air, but
      to build and equip these machines they must have land and the products
      of land, and must constantly come back to land. Therefore those who own
      the land must be the masters of the rest. Thus, if one man has come to
      own all the land, he is their absolute master even to life or death. If
      they can live on the land only on his terms, then they can live only on
      his terms, for without land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves,
      and so long as his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they
      must do in everything as he wills.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, however, the concentration of landownership
    has not gone so far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
    land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is competition
    between them as well as between those who have only their labor &#8211; then
    the terms on which these non-landholders can live will seem more like free
    contract. But it will not be free contract. Land can yield no wealth without
    the application of labor; labor can produce no wealth without land. These
    are the two equally necessary factors of production. Yet, to say that they
    are equally necessary factors of production is not to say that, in the making
    of contracts as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors
    of these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
    very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have his
    stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but labor cannot
    exist without land. <strong>If I own a piece of land, I can let it lie idle
    for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the laborer must eat
    every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the making of terms between
    them, the landowner has an immense advantage over the laborer.</strong> It
    is on the side of the laborer that the intense pressure of competition comes,
    for in his case it is competition urged by hunger. And, further than this:
    As population increases, as the competition for the use of land becomes more
    and more intense, so are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of
    their land a larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon
    it produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
    steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation of
    future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the effects
    of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a constant tendency
    to force mere laborers to take less and less or to give more and more (put
    it which way you please, it amounts to the same thing) of the products of
    their work for the opportunity to work. And thus, in the very nature of things,
    we should see on our little island or our little world that, after a time
    had passed, some of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance
    of all the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others would
    be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But let us introduce another element into
    the supposition. Let us suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such
    as the steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the reaping-machine,
    and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that are such a marked feature
    of our era. What would be the result?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries
    and inventions is to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to
    enable the same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
    amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen the necessity
    for land. Until we can discover some way of making something out of nothing &#8211; and
    that is so far beyond our powers as to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there
    is no possible discovery or invention which can lessen the dependence of
    labor upon land. And, this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving
    devices, land being the private property of some, would simply be to increase
    the proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for the
    use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and inventions
    would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more dependent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, since we are imagining conditions,
    imagine laborsaving inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that
    is to say, to perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being
    done away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
    to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one else.
    For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they continued to exist,
    it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of the landowners! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<p>Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
      Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to royal libertarians,
land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to classical liberals,
land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>A right of property in
movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson </small><small>... <a
