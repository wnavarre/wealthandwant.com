      mean that one is entitled to keep that piece of land forever as one's own,

        that

        man creates

        work. Land was
        here before man, and will be here after we're gone, and we are all directly
        and completely dependent on having access to land in order to support
      ourselves and our families. This necessarily means that all of us who claim
      a piece
        of land as our own are entitled to secure title, but that in return for
        that secure title, must pay to the community the economic value of
      the site, every year or every month.</p>
    <p align="left">I'm not suggesting that those who created the improvements
      on land ought not to be compensated for their value. Those improvements
      are legitimately private property. But the economic value of land is different.

                <p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly.
                    It is not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land
                    that determines its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic
                    qualities land that is no better than other land which may be
                    had for the using can have no value. And the value of land always
                    measures the difference between it and the best land that may
                    be had for the using. Thus, the value of land expresses in exact
                    and tangible form the right of the community in land held by
                    an individual; and rent expresses the exact amount which the
                    individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal rights
                of all other members of the community.</p>
                <p>Thus, if we concede to priority of possession the undisturbed
                    use of land, taxing rent into the public treasury for the benefit
                    of the community, we reconcile the fixity of tenure which is
                    necessary for improvement with a full and complete recognition
                of the equal rights of all to the use of land.</p>
                <p>Consider what rent is. It does not arise spontaneously from
                    land; it is due to nothing that the land owners have done. It
                represents a value created by the whole community.</p>
                <p><strong>Let the land holders have, if you please, all that the
                      possession of the land would give them in the absence of the
                      rest of the
                    community. But rent, the creation of the whole community, necessarily

            <p><font size="-2">[03] </font>This westward expansion of population has gone on steadily since the
  first settlement of the Eastern shore. It has been the great distinguishing
  feature in the conditions of our people. Without its possibility we would have
  been in nothing what we are. Our higher standard of wages and of comfort and
  of average intelligence, our superior self-reliance, energy, inventiveness,
  adaptability and assimilative power, spring as directly from this possibility
  of expansion as does our unprecedented growth. All that we are proud of in
  national life and national character comes primarily from our background of
  unused land. We are but transplanted Europeans, and, for that matter mostly
  of the &quot;inferior classes.&quot; It is not usually those whose position
  is comfortable and whose prospects are bright who emigrate; it is those who
  are pinched and dissatisfied, those to whom no prospect seems open. There are
  heralds' colleges in Europe that drive a good business in providing a certain
  class of Americans with pedigrees and coats of arms; but it is probably well
  for this sort of self-esteem that the majority of us cannot truly trace our
  ancestry very far. We had some Pilgrim Fathers, it is true; likewise some Quaker
  fathers, and other sorts of fathers; yet the majority even of the early settlers
  did not come to America for &quot;freedom to worship God,&quot; but because
  they were poor, dissatisfied, unsuccessful, or recklessly adventurous &#8212;  many
  because they were evicted, many to escape imprisonment, many because they were
  kidnapped, many as self-sold bondsmen, as indentured apprentices, or mercenary
  soldiers. It is the virtue of new soil, the freedom of opportunity given by
  the possibility of expansion, that has here transmuted into wholesome human
  growth material that, had it remained in Europe, might have been degraded and
  dangerous, just as in Australia the same conditions have made respected and
  self-respecting citizens out of the descendants of convicts, and even out of
  convicts themselves.</p>

              Scotch people are very absurd people, but
              they are not a whit more so than we are. I read only a little while
              ago of some Long Island fishermen who had been paying as rent for the
              privilege of fishing there, a certain part of the catch. They paid it
              because they believed that James II, a dead man centuries ago, a man
              who never put his foot in America, a king who was kicked off the
              English throne, had said they had to pay it, and they got up a
              committee, went to the county town and searched the records. They
              could not find anything in the records to show that James II had ever
              ordered that they should give any of their fish to anybody, and so
              they refused to pay any longer. But if they had found that James II
              had really said they should they would have gone on paying. Can
          anything be more absurd? </small></div>

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Crowded! Is it any wonder that
              people are crowded together as they are in this city, when we see other
              people taking up far more land than they can by any possibility use,
              and holding it for enormous prices? Why, what would have happened if,
              when these doors were opened, the first people who came in had claimed
              all the seats around them, and demanded a price of others who
              afterwards came in by the same equal right? Yet that is precisely the
              way we are treating this continent. ... </small><br>
            <br>
            <small>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it
              mean? Well, it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It
              does not merely mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway
              robbery! There are other forms of stealing which it prohibits as well.
              It certainly means (if it has any meaning) that we shall not take that
            to which we are not entitled, to the detriment of others.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Now, here is a desert. Here is a caravan going along over the
              desert. Here is a gang of robbers. They say: "Look! There is a rich
              caravan; let us go and rob it, kill the men if necessary, take their
              goods from them, their camels and horses, and walk off." But one of the
            robbers says:</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>"Oh, no; that is dangerous; besides, that would be stealing! <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let us, instead of doing that, go ahead to
              where there is a spring, the only spring at which this caravan can get
              water in this desert. Let us put a wall around it and call it ours, and
              when they come up we won&#8217;t let them have any water until they have
              given us all the goods they have."</span> That would be more
              gentlemanly, more polite, and more respectable; but would it not be
              theft all the same? And is it not theft of the same kind when people go
              ahead in advance of population and get land they have no use whatever
              for, and then, as people come into the world and population increases,
              will not let this increasing population use the land until they pay an
            exorbitant price?</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are
              founded. Do that under the false code of morality which exists here
              today and people will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and
              will say you have made money because you are a very superior person,
              and that all can make money if they will only work and be industrious!
              But is it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not
              steal," as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket? ...&nbsp;<a

              land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is the most

              rights of God's children to their Father's bounty is denied, as we now
              deny them on this earth, what is the duty enjoined on Christians by the

          <blockquote>
            <p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming in space.
                  Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide the land, share
                  and share alike, as individual property. At first, while population is sparse
            and industrial processes rude and primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
            <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and look again.
                  Some families will have died out, some have greatly multiplied; on the whole,
                  population will have largely increased, and even supposing there have been
                  no important inventions or improvements in the productive arts, the increase
                  in population, by causing the division of labor, will have made industry
                  more complex. During this time some of these people will have been careless,
                  generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some of
                  them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how they themselves
                  and the things they see around them came to be, to inquiries and speculations
                  as to what there is in the universe beyond their little island or their little
                  world, to making poems, painting pictures, or writing books; to noting the
                  differences in rocks and trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts
                  and birds and fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the
                  many things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
                  happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others again will
                  have devoted all their energies to the extending of their possessions. What,
                  then, shall we see, land having been all this time treated as private property?
                  Clearly, we shall see that the primitive equality has given way to inequality.
                  Some will have very much more than one of the original shares into which
                  the land was divided; very many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in
                  all things save this, our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that
                  there are no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
                  taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency; imagine,
                  if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is utterly abolished;
                  yet inequality in the ownership of land will have produced poverty and virtual
            slavery.</p>
            <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to say,
                  in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can live only on
                  land and by the aid of the products of land. They may make machines which
                  will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps to fly in the air, but to
                  build and equip these machines they must have land and the products of land,
                  and must constantly come back to land. Therefore those who own the land must
                  be the masters of the rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land,
                  he is their absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the
                  land only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
                  land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as his ownership
            is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in everything as he wills.</p>
            <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so far as to
                  make one or a very few men the owners of all the land &#8211; if there are
                  still so many landowners that there is competition between them as well as
                  between those who have only their labor &#8211; then the terms on which these
                  non-landholders can live will seem more like free contract. But it will not
                  be free contract. Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor;
                  labor can produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
                  factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary factors
                  of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts as to how the
                  results of production are divided, the possessors of these two meet on equal
                  terms. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the nature of these two factors
                  is very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have his
                  stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but labor cannot
                  exist without land.</span> If I own a piece of land, I can let it lie idle
                  for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the laborer must eat every day, and his family
                  must eat. And so, in the making of terms between them, the landowner has
                  an immense advantage over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that
                  the intense pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
                  urged by hunger.</span> And, further than this: As population increases,
                  as the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
                  are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a larger
                  and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it produces. That
                  is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this steady rise in the
                  value of land brings about a confident expectation of future increase of
                  value, which produces among landowners all the effects of a combination to
                  hold for higher prices. Thus there is a constant tendency to force mere laborers
                  to take less and less or to give more and more (put it which way you please,
                  it amounts to the same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity
                  to work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our little
                  island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some of the people
                  would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all the fruits of labor
                  without doing any labor at all, while others would be forced to work the
            livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
            <p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us suppose
                  great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the steam-engine, the power-loom,
                  the Bessemer process, the reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving
            devices that are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
            <p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is to increase
                  the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the same amount
                  of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater amount with the same
                  labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen the necessity for land. Until
                  we can discover some way of making something out of nothing &#8211; and that
                  is so far beyond our powers as to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there
                  is no possible discovery or invention which can lessen the dependence of
                  labor upon land. And, this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving
                  devices, land being the private property of some, would simply be to increase
                  the proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for the
                  use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and inventions
            would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more dependent.</p>
            <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving inventions to
                  go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to perfection. What
                  then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done away with, all the wealth
                  that the land could produce would go entire to the landowners. None of it
                  whatever could be claimed by any one else. For the laborers there would be
                  no use at all. If they continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers
            on the bounty of the landowners! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

          <blockquote>
            <p>Here, let us imagine, is <b>an unbounded savannah</b>, stretching
              off in unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the
              traveler tires of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first
              immigrant. Where to settle he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems
              as good as every other acre. As to wood, as to water, as to fertility,
              as to situation, there is absolutely no choice, and he is perplexed
              by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out with the search for one
              place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere, anywhere &#8212; and
              starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and rich, game is
              abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is at her
              very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
              him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving,
              which would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under
              all the material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary
              assistance for any work that requires a greater union of strength than
              that afforded by his own family, or by such help as he can permanently
              keep. Though he has cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to
              get a beefsteak he must kill a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith,
              wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in short, a "jack of all
              trades and master of none." He cannot have his children schooled, for,
              to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such things as
              he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on hand,
              or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
              making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced
              to do so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a
              broken auger may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days.
              Under such circumstances, though nature is prolific, the man is poor.
              It is an easy matter for him to get enough to eat; but beyond this,
              his labor will suffice to satisfy only the simplest wants in the rudest
            way. </p>
            <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section*
              of the boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he
              is not beset by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the
              land is the same, there is one place that is clearly better for him
              than any other place, and that is where there is already a settler
              and he may have a neighbor. He settles by the side of the first comer,
              whose condition is at once greatly improved, and to whom many things
              are now possible that were before impossible, for two men may help
            each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands
                of the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square,
                and a quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment
                to a settler under the Homestead Act. </font>          <br>
            </div>
            Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles
            where there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first
            comer there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness
            which, in the solitary state, it could not approach. If heavy work is
            to be done, the settlers have a logrolling, and together accomplish in
            a day what singly would require years. When one kills a bullock, the
            others take part of it, returning when they kill, and thus they have
            fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster, and the children
            of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching would
            have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
            send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is
            less need for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set
            up shops, and our settler can have his tools repaired for a small part
            of the labor it formerly cost him. A store is opened and he can get what
            he wants as he wants it; a postoffice, soon added, gives him regular
            communication with the rest of the world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter,
            a harness maker, a doctor; and a little church soon arises. Satisfactions
            become possible that in the solitary state were impossible. There are
            gratifications for the social and the intellectual nature &#8212; for
            that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power of sympathy,
            the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
            open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are
            others to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There
            are husking bees, and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the
            ballroom be unplastered and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of
            the magician are yet in the strain, and Cupid dances with the dancers.
            At the wedding, there are others to admire and enjoy; in the house of
            death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands human sympathy to
            sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open
            up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
            times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity
            and power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle
            of John Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by,
            comes the circus, talked of months before, and opening to children whose
            horizon has been the prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes
            and princesses of fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors,
            Cinderella's fairy coach, and the giants of nursery lore; lions such
            as crouched before Daniel, or in circling Roman amphitheater tore the
            saints of God; ostriches who recall the sandy deserts; camels such as
            stood around when the wicked brethren raised Joseph from the well and
            sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps with Hannibal,
            or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music that thrills and
            builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome of Kubla Khan.
        <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
          you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
          you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
          is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
          need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
          you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
          of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
          potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
          and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
          we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
          all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
          increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
          things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
          it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
          yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
          far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
          upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
          this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
          stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
          not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
          the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
          the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
          land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
          center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
          of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
          will be raised.</p>
        <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
          economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
          of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
          the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
          it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
          into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
          With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
          land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
          expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
          of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
          branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
          especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
          in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
          go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
          and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
          the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
          of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
          distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
          the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
          power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
          acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
          had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
          fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
          transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
          and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
          themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
          has given the land.</p>
        <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
          to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
          into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
          still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
          the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
          becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
          are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
          friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
          that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
          one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
          set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
          have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
          is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
          into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
          of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
          of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
          museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
          all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
          actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
          is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
        <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
          of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
          over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
          tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
          eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
          engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
          of horses. </p>
        <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
            other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
            focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
            of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
            attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
            fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
            the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
            productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
            has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another <a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip
            Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
            from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
            are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
            than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
            more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
            streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
            finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
            Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
            same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
            it had no value at all.</p>
        <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
          in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
          him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
          difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
          rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
          compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
          which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
          valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
          not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
          utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
        <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
          gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
          attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
          of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
          makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
          rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
          of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
        <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
            as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
            heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
            brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
            fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
            fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
            Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
            and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
            be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
            will have greatly increased.</p>
        <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If
          the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch
          and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. <b><i>And

          <blockquote>
            <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive
              term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property, of which
              in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
              if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading
              it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
              property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
              property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge
              for private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order
            of presentation. You urge:</p>
            <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
              (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
              2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
              reason. (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
              3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
              (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
              4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
              (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
              5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
              of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it
              is sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
              6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
              property in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs
              14-17.) ...<br>
              7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
              wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
              51.) ...<br>
              8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
              not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to
              take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
            to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
            <p>          <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
            reason.</strong> (6-7.)</p>
            <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason
              and forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the
              earth, but also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he
            may make provision for the future.</p>
            <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing
              attribute of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows,
              as the Scriptures declare, that he is created in the likeness of God.
              And this gift of reason does, as your Holiness points out, involve
              the need and right of private property in whatever is produced by the
              exertion of reason and its attendant forethought, as well as in what
              is produced by physical labor. In truth, these elements of man&#8217;s
              production are inseparable, and labor involves the use of reason. It
              is by his reason that man differs from the animals in being a producer,
              and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical powers are slight,
              forming as it were but the connection by which the mind takes hold
              of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and forces
              of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
            in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
            <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach
              to things provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot
            attach to things provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
            <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert
              as the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought
              to provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right
              of property in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless
              desert those who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might
              ask water from the provident in charity, could not demand it in right.
              For while water itself is of the providence of God, the presence of
              this water in such vessels, at such place, results from the providence
            of the men who carried it. Thus they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
            <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
              the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink
              of the water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give
            any right?</p>
            <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it
              is needed, but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to
            defend in defending the private ownership of land!</p>
            <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those
              who say that if private property in land be not just, then private
              property in the products of labor is not just, as the material of these
              products is taken from land. It will be seen on consideration that
              all of man&#8217;s production is analogous to such transportation of
              water as we have supposed. In growing grain, or smelting metals, or
              building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing any of the things that
              constitute producing, all that man does is to change in place or form
              preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer, not a creator;
              God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s production
              consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of private
              ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
              of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production
              is embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the
              common gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir
              and brought into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of
            the individual who by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
            <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary
              possession. For though man may take material from the storehouse of
              nature and change it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from
              the moment he takes it, it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood
              decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates and is displaced, while of
              more perishable products, some will last for only a few months, others
              for only a few days, and some disappear immediately on use. Though,
              so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever persists;
              though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that floats
              in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
              ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining
              constantly passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what
              natural material is embodied in the products of man never constitutes
              more than temporary possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir
              provided for all. As taking water from one place and carrying it to
              another place by no means lessens the store of water, since whether
              it is drunk or spilled or left to evaporate, it must return again to
              the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is it with all things on which man
            in production can lay the impress of his labor.</p>
            <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right
              to have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish
              in the using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you
              are right in so far as you may include such things as buildings, which
              with repair will last for generations, with such things as food or
              fire-wood, which are destroyed in the use. But when you infer that
              man can have private ownership in those permanent things of nature
              that are the reservoirs from which all must draw, you are clearly wrong.
              Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits of the earth produced
              by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of that labor, and
              pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were taken,
              and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
              he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which
              must constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men
            can produce, but even their very bodies.</p>
            <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth
              itself as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it,
              is in the facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when
            you truly say:</p>
            <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they
              demand new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse
              that shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this
            he finds only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
            <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the
            private property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
            <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore,
              owes to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you
              mean God. Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred
              an obligation to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail,
              is the same as is thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion
            by the <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Bishop of Meath</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having
                  created us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the
                means necessary for our subsistence. The land is the only source
                of this
                  kind now known to us. The land, therefore, of every country is
                the common property of the people of that country, because its real
                owner,
                  the Creator who made it, has transferred it as a voluntary gift
                to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now, as
                every individual in that country is a creature and child of God,
                and as all
                  his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
                of a country that would exclude the humblest man in that country
                from
                  his share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice
                  and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE
              TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS OF HIS CREATOR.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>          <strong>4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land
            itself.</strong>            (9-10.)</p>
            <p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended on land gives a
              right to ownership of the land, and that the improvement of land creates
            benefits indistinguishable and inseparable from the land itself.</p>
            <p>This contention, if valid, could only justify the ownership of land
              by those who expend industry on it. It would not justify private property
              in land as it exists. On the contrary, it would justify a gigantic
              no-rent declaration that would take land from those who now legally
              own it, the landlords, and turn it over to the tenants and laborers.
              And if it also be that improvements cannot be distinguished and separated
              from the land itself, how could the landlords claim consideration even
            for improvements they had made?</p>
            <p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words imply. What you really
              mean, I take it, is that the original justification and title of landownership
              is in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither can this justify
              private property in land as it exists. For is it not all but universally
              true that existing land titles do not come from use, but from force
            or fraud?</p>
            <p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part of the land of Italy
              is held by those who so far from ever having expended industry on it
              have been mere appropriators of the industry of those who have? Is
              this not also true of Great Britain and of other countries? Even in
              the United States, where the forces of concentration have not yet had
              time fully to operate and there has been some attempt to give land
              to users, it is probably true today that the greater part of the land
              is held by those who neither use it nor propose to use it themselves,
              but merely hold it to compel others to pay them for permission to use
            it.</p>
            <p>And if industry give ownership to land what are the limits of this
              ownership? If a man may acquire the ownership of several square miles
              of land by grazing sheep on it, does this give to him and his heirs
              the ownership of the same land when it is found to contain rich mines,
              or when by the growth of population and the progress of society it
              is needed for farming, for gardening, for the close occupation of a
              great city? Is it on the rights given by the industry of those who
              first used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes that you would found
              the title to the land now covered by the city of New York and having
            a value of thousands of millions of dollars?</p>
            <p>But your contention is not valid. Industry expended on land gives
              ownership in the fruits of that industry, but not in the land itself,
              just as industry expended on the ocean would give a right of ownership
              to the fish taken by it, but not a right of ownership in the ocean.
              Nor yet is it true that private ownership of land is necessary to secure
              the fruits of labor on land; nor does the improvement of land create
              benefits indistinguishable and inseparable from the land itself. That
              secure possession is necessary to the use and improvement of land I
              have already explained, but that ownership is not necessary is shown
              by the fact that in all civilized countries land owned by one person
              is cultivated and improved by other persons. Most of the cultivated
              land in the British Islands, as in Italy and other countries, is cultivated
              not by owners but by tenants. And so the costliest buildings are erected
              by those who are not owners of the land, but who have from the owner
              a mere right of possession for a time on condition of certain payments.
              Nearly the whole of London has been built in this way, and in New York,
              Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as in
              continental cities, the owners of many of the largest edifices will
              be found to be different persons from the owners of the ground. So
              far from the value of improvements being inseparable from the value
              of land, it is in individual transactions constantly separated. For
              instance, one-half of the land on which the immense Grand Pacific Hotel
              in Chicago stands was recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is
              a not infrequent occurrence for one person to own a fruit-tree and
            another to own the ground in which it is implanted.</p>
            <p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether it be clearing,
              plowing, manuring, cultivating, the digging of cellars, the opening
              of wells or the building of houses, that so long as its usefulness
              continues does not have a value clearly distinguishable from the value
              of the land. For land having such improvements will always sell or
            rent for more than similar land without them.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what the land irrespective
              of improvement would bring, it will take the benefits of mere ownership,
              but will leave the full benefits of use and improvement, which the
              prevailing system does not do. And since the holder, who would still
              in form continue to be the owner, could at any time give or sell both
              possession and improvements, subject to future assessment by the state
              on the value of the land alone, he will be perfectly free to retain
              or dispose of the full amount of property that the exertion of his
              labor or the investment of his capital has attached to or stored up
            in the land.</p>
            <p>Thus, what we propose would secure, as it is impossible in any other
              way to secure, what you properly say is just and right &#8212; &#8221;that
              the results of labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; But
              private property in land &#8212; to allow the holder without adequate
              payment to the state to take for himself the benefit of the value that
              attaches to land with social growth and improvement &#8212; does take
              the results of labor from him who has labored, does turn over the fruits
              of one man&#8217;s labor to be enjoyed by another. For labor, as the
              active factor, is the producer of all wealth. Mere ownership produces
              nothing. A man might own a world, but so sure is the decree that &#8220;by
              the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,&#8221; that without labor
              he could not get a meal or provide himself a garment. Hence, when the
              owners of land, by virtue of their ownership and without laboring themselves,
              get the products of labor in abundance, these things must come from
              the labor of others, must be the fruits of others&#8217; sweat, taken
              from those who have a right to them and enjoyed by those who have no
            right to them.</p>
            <p>The only utility of private ownership of land as distinguished from
              possession is the evil utility of giving to the owner products of labor
              he does not earn. For until land will yield to its owner some return
              beyond that of the labor and capital he expends on it &#8212; that
              is to say, until by sale or rental he can without expenditure of labor
              obtain from it products of labor, ownership amounts to no more than
              security of possession, and has no value. Its importance and value
              begin only when, either in the present or prospectively, it will yield
              a revenue &#8212; that is to say, will enable the owner as owner to
              obtain products of labor without exertion on his part, and thus to
            enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</p>
            <p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery involved in private
              property in land is that in the most striking cases the robbery is
              not of individuals, but of the community. For, as I have before explained,
              it is impossible for rent in the economic sense &#8212; that value
              which attaches to land by reason of social growth and improvement &#8212; to
              go to the user. It can go only to the owner or to the community. Thus
              those who pay enormous rents for the use of land in such centers as
              London or New York are not individually injured. Individually they
              get a return for what they pay, and must feel that they have no better
              right to the use of such peculiarly advantageous localities without
              paying for it than have thousands of others. And so, not thinking or
              not caring for the interests of the community, they make no objection
            to the system.</p>
            <p>It recently came to light in New York that a man having no title
              whatever had been for years collecting rents on a piece of land
              that the growth
              of the city had made very valuable. Those who paid these rents
              had never stopped to ask whether he had any right to them. They
              felt that
              they had no right to land that so many others would like to have,
              without paying for it, and did not think of, or did not care for,
              the rights
            of all.... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

              in, acquire by his priority the right to shut the doors and have

              <br>
  The cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests at a banquet

  is room for all who come; passengers from station to station, on an orb that
  whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess cannot be exclusive;
  they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights of others. Just as the
  passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and his baggage over as many
  seats as he pleases, until other passengers come in, so may a settler take
  and use as much land as he chooses, until it is needed by others &#8212; a
  fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when his right must
  be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation

            <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with
              wherever society has reached a certain development, has resulted
              from the appropriation of land as individual property. It is the
              ownership of the soil that everywhere gives the ownership of the
              men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind to which the
              enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
              witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague
              tradition in the biblical story of the famine during which the
              Pharaoh purchased up the lands of the people. It was slavery of
              this kind to which, in the twilight of history, the conquerors
              of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of that peninsula, transforming
              them into helots by making them pay rent for their lands. It was
              the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
              or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient
              Italy from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered
              the world, into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation
              of the land as the absolute property of their chieftains which
              gradually turned the descendants of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic
              and Hunnish warriors into colonii and villains, and which changed
              the independent burghers of Sclavonic village communities into
              the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted the
              feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which
              made the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters
              of their fellows. How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds
              and warriors who, as comparative philology tells us, descended
              from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic race into the
              lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
              Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us
              a hint. The white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of
              the Indian Rajah are the flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or sewing machines,
thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows straining and striving
to bring up the little ones deprived of their natural bread-winner; the children
that are growing up in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions
in which only a miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn
them in advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they
die,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>because we permit them to be
robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a system which disinherits the
vast majority of the children that come into the world. There is enough and to
spare for them. Had they the equal rights in the estate which their Creator has
given them, there would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out
a mere existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put
bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we
may see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that are
deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization today. &#8212; <a href="George_TSNS.html">Thou

            <p><em><strong>c. The Law of Division of Labor and Trade</strong></em></p>
            <p>Now, what is it that leads men to conform their conduct to the
              principle illustrated by the last chart? Why do they divide their
              labor, and trade its products? A simple, universal and familiar
              law of human nature moves them. Whether men be isolated, or be
              living in primitive communities, or in advanced states of civilization,
              their demand for consumption determines the direction of Labor
              in production.67 That is the law. Considered in connection with
              a solitary individual, like Robinson Crusoe upon his island, it
              is obvious. What he demanded for consumption he was obliged to
              produce. Even as to the goods he collected from stranded ships &#8212; desiring
              to consume them, he was obliged to labor to produce them to places
              of safety. His demand for consumption always determined the direction
              of his labor in production.68 And when we remember that what Robinson
              Crusoe was to his island in the sea, civilized man as a whole is
              to this island in space, we may readily understand the application
              of the same simple law to the great body of labor in the civilized
              world.69 Nevertheless, the complexities of civilized life are so
              likely to obscure its operation and disguise its relations to social
              questions like that of the persistence of poverty as to make illustration
              desirable.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1">68. It is highly significant that while Robinson

            <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
            <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law,
              99 thereby creating social disorder and inviting social disease.
              Upon society alone, therefore, and not upon divine Providence which
              has provided bountifully, nor upon the disinherited poor, rests
              the responsibility for poverty and fear of poverty.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning
              with the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take
              possession of the best land. But instead of leaving for others
              what they do not themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations,
              they appropriate the whole space, using only part, but claiming
              ownership of the rest. We may distinguish the used part with red
              color, and that which is appropriated without use with blue. Thus:
              [chart]</p>
            <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than
              is used? Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary
              benefit of future social growth. What will enable them to secure
              that? Our system of confiscating Rent from the community that earns
              it, and giving it to land-owners who, as such, earn nothing.100</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years
                  ago a workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing
                  possession of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by
                  a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But the owner of the land
                  on which the meteorite fell claimed the money, and the two
                  went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
                  of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right
                  of discovery, nor by right of labor, could the workman have
                  the money, because the title to the meteorite was in the man
                  who owned the land upon which it fell.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come,
              instead of finding half of the best land still common and free,
              as in the corresponding chart on page 68, they find all of it owned,
              and are obliged either to go upon poorer land or to buy or rent
              from owners of the best. How much will they pay for the best? Not
              more than 1, if they want it for use and not to hold for a higher
              price in the future, for that represents the full difference between
              its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But
              if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon
              be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or
              to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land of
              the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently
              land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
            <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary
              it cannot be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited
              by the superiority of the best land over that which can be had
              for nothing, and the chart may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
            <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best
              land in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure
              of labor force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not
              to use it that it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to
              put Rent into their own pockets as soon as growing demand for land
              makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose that all
              the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
              thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
            <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there
              is no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior
              land for higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill,
              is like owning lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps,
              but not profitable. But let more land be needed for use, and matters
              promptly assume a different appearance. The new labor must either
              go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from owners of
              better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
              case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get
              more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as
              Rent, either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower
              Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical
                  or continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground
                  rent.&quot; But actual or potential Rent may always be, and
                  frequently is, capitalized for the purpose of selling the right
                  to enjoy it, and it is to selling value that we usually refer
                  when dealing in land.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to
                  its owner will have a selling value, whether it be used or
                  not, and whether Rent is actually derived from it or not. This
                  selling value will be the capitalization of its present or
                  prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much the larger
                  proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
                  unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if
                  fully used. This condition is expressed in the chart by the

                  expenses, including those of collecting the rents, and on the
                  other for its mineral wealth, its capabilities of development
                  for any kind of business, and its advantages, material, social,

                  rental; and other things being equal, it will be the higher
                  the more important these direct gratifications are, as well

                  to the possession of a thing the power of obtaining other things,
                  in return for it or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the
                  usual sense &#8212; is purely relative. It exists from and
                  is measured by the power of obtaining things for things by
                  exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for nothing
                  can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
                  physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy
                  or whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If
                  we ask ourselves the reason of . . . variations in . . . value
                  . . . we see that things having some form of utility or desirability,
                  are valuable or not valuable, as they are hard or easy to get.
                  And if we ask further, we may see that with most of the things
                  that have value this difficulty or ease of getting them, which
                  determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
                  be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the
                  place, form and condition in which they are desired. . . Value
                  is simply an expression of the labor required for the production
                  of such a thing. But there are some things as to which this
                  is not so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective
                  of any improvements that labor has made on it, often has value.
                  . . Yet a little examination will show that such facts are
                  but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
                  rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the
                  universal law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced
                  by labor, from a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate
                  structure and appurtenances of a first-class ocean steamer,
                  is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the labor required
                  to produce such a thing in form and place; while the value
                  of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
                  of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent
                  of the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the
                  owner to obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher,

            <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
              Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the
              space, but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither
              Rent nor Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might
              be.</p>
            <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used,

              would reach if all the space above the poorest were fully used.
              It thereby appears that under a system which confiscates Rent to

              so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if

            <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use
              we have as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now

              power of the given expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied
              to the best land, 50 when applied to the next best, 10 to the next,
              3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would not be benefited
              now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation
              of land for use only, although much less land is actually used.
              The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
              men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to
              make it more than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth
              grade would be taken up in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus
              labor&quot; would be crowded out to the open space that originally
              yielded nothing, but which in consequence of increased labor power
              now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally yielded,
              namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
              then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space.

            <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is
              the least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the
              downward movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They
              cannot fall below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter
              how much productive power may increase, so long as it pays to hold
              land for higher values. Some laborers would continually be pushed
              back to land which increased productive power would have brought
              up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition
              for work would so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure
              of labor force, however much it produced, could nowhere secure
              more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would persist until
              some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase in productive
              power, would not yield the accustomed living without increase of
              labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
              to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over
              and over again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of
              land were monopolized, until human endurance could go no further.104
              Either that, or they would be obliged to adapt themselves to a
              lower scale of living.105</p>

                  Economy,&quot; book ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to
                  improvements in agricultural implements which diminish the
                  expense of cultivation, that they do not increase the profits
                  of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but that &quot;the
                  landlord will receive in addition to the rent already paid
                  to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
                  is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also
                  of improvements in all other branches of industry.</font></p>

                  in commodities, the tendency of increasing price to draw forth
                  additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance in
                  land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency
                  can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
                  a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor
                  and capital as the condition of engaging in production. If
                  it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were
                  reached, it would be possible to continuously increase rent
                  until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
                  be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will
                  consent to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point
                  at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a
                  limit which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence,
                  speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries
                  where wages and interest are already near the minimum, as in
                  countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
                  is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the
                  speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit where production
                  would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial
                  paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch.

            <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general
              readjustment are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These
              culminate in forcing unused land into the market, thereby reducing
              Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase of labor force, a lowering
              of the scale of living, and depression of Rent, co-operate to bring
              on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner do &quot;good
              times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent rises
              again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
              The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher
              and Wages lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

                  each other the relation of cause and effect, is obvious to

                  of living, which is the same thing) in all departments of labor
                  and with all grades of laborers. This tendency continues until
                  the fictitious values of land give way. So long as the tendency
                  is felt only by that class which is hired for wages, it is
                  poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class
                  of labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests
                  of the country,&quot; it is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard
                  times&quot; are periodical because land values, by falling,
                  allow &quot;good times&quot; to set it, and by rising with &quot;good

                  of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without much, if

            <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates
              Rent from common to individual uses, produces this result. That
              maladjustment is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress,
              so long as the maladjustment continues, instead of tending to remove
              poverty as naturally it should, actually generates and intensifies
              it. Poverty persists with increase of productive power because
              land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
              greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues:
              for individuals suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>

            and Efficiency</small><br>
            <small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

            <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
            <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
            a case
            for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
            logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
            follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
            principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
            the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
            one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
            is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
            important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
            efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
            because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
            for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
            on land
            would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
            report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
            shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
            in the Appendix.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
            taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
            reasons
            why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
            world peace.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
            argument for
            taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
            offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
            rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
            price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
            land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
            increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
            become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
            land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
            on
            land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
            the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
            erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
            because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
            collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
            <small>.</small></strong><br>
            <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
            that the
            return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
            rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
            what land
            is.<strong> ...</strong><br>
            <br>
            </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ethical Case for
            Taxing Land</span></small><br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The ethical case for taxing land is
            based on two premises.&nbsp; The
            first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
            controversial since the end of slavery, so I will simply assume that
            this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
            rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Natural opportunities include not only land, but also water,
            fish in
            oceans and rivers, the frequency spectrum, minerals, virgin forests,
            and geosynchronous orbits.&nbsp; Some natural opportunities, such as
            the opportunity to use the oceans for transport, are most valuable to
            people when all are allowed to use them as they wish.&nbsp; (This does
            not imply that their value is greatest when all can pollute as they
            wish.)&nbsp; Other natural opportunities, such as most plots of land,
            are most valuable when one person has exclusive use of them.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The processes that humans employ to determine who shall have
            exclusive
            use of natural opportunities are complex.&nbsp; To some extent,
            opportunities are assigned to those who first make use of them.&nbsp;
            However, another important component of the
            natural-opportunity-assignment process is the ability and willingness
            to use deadly force to exclude others.&nbsp; Americans from Europe
            undertook some negotiations with the native American Indians, but
            primarily they threatened to kill the Indians if they did not agree to
            move into smaller territories.&nbsp; All over the world, nations
            emerged when war-minded leaders imposed their rule where they
            could.&nbsp; We have built a relatively humane world on this violent
            foundation, but the origins of the assignment of natural opportunities
            cannot be characterized as just.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Nor would have been just (or efficient) to adhere to a rule of
            initial
            assignment based on first use.&nbsp; It would not be just because a
            person who arrives later than another is not inher&shy;ently less
            deserving.&nbsp; (It would not be efficient because a rule of
            assignment based on first use promotes inefficient, excessive
            investment in being first.&nbsp; Still, to motivate efficient
            discov&shy;ery, it pays to provide some reward for discoverers.)&nbsp; <a

                theories of justice share the feature that they do not acknowledge
                self-ownership. Under Utilitarianism, persons are inputs into the
                generation of aggregate utility. Under Contractarianism, persons
                might have owned themselves in the contractual setting, but there
                they sold themselves. The rights of real people are gone. Theories
                in these classes can be contrasted with a class of theories that
                justify power with direct responses to those who question power,
                treating them as individuals who own themselves. <b>There are two

                  own things. The Libertarian axiom (Rothbard, 1982, pp. 29-43) is
                  that everything in nature is the property of the first person who
                  transforms it. This contrasts with the Liberal axiom (Ackerman,
                  1980, pp. 11, 31- 68) that the claims that people make on natural
                  opportunities are respectable only if the person making the claim
              leaves as much for others as she takes for herself.</b></small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a Libertarian is asked, "Why
                should you have that opportunity instead of me?" he can reply, within
                his own theory, "Because I got here first and did something." The
                Liberal says that any appropriation of natural opportunities that
                leaves less for those who come later fails to satisfy the condition
            of evenhandedness that is required for justice.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Libertarian and Liberal theories
                both have limitations in terms of efficiency. Acceptance of the Libertarian
                theory promotes a land rush, in which people waste resources doing
                the minimal work necessary to establish claims to land, so that they
                can later sell it to others. (Whoever burns down the most rain forest
                gets the most land.) This first inefficiency is compounded by a continuing
                inefficient use of land, arising from the inability of people to
                manage all that they have claimed. If the Liberal theory is accepted,
                an opposite inefficiency occurs. There is no incentive for people
                to seek to discover opportunities hidden in nature, because whatever
            is discovered belongs equally to all.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While it may be difficult to avoid
                having these inefficiencies color our evaluations of the theories,
                we should remember that the pursuit of justice does not guarantee
                efficiency. It is possible that a commitment to justice will entail
            accepting some inefficiency.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic problem with the justice
                of Libertarian theory is that it allows the first arrivers to deprive
                those who come later of any natural opportunities that it suits the
                first arrivers to claim and transform. To permit this is inconsistent
            with the evenhandedness that justice requires.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A Libertarian might allege that
                it would never be possible for the first arrivers to leave as much
                for all later arrivers as they take for themselves, because there
                may be an endless stream of generations, and each person would be
                unable to claim even enough land to stand on. This objection presumes
                that any claims would be made on the stock of land, rather than on
                the flow of land services. Under Liberalism, each person may respectably
                claim the use of an amount of land during her lifetime that leaves
                as much land rent per person for others who are alive at the same
                time as the rent of the land that the claimant reserves for herself.
                People may also respectably reserve more for themselves, if they
                compensate those who therefore have less. There will be plenty of
            room for everyone to stand.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Libertarianism is an excellent framework
                for analyzing justice when there is no scarcity of natural opportunities.
                But when natural opportunities are scarce it denies the equal rights
            of those who come later.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Coercion_PF.html"><span

            <br>
            <small>What a planet, eh?! Here we are with an arrangement somehow foisted
              on us whereby land, which should be our equal and common inheritance, has been
              privately misappropriated. Or put it this way: we're born on to a planet where "all
              the seats are taken", and we have to pay someone else for permission to live!
              There's no way of escaping it for, as long as the Law of Gravity holds, we
              need something to stand on. And to compound the land problem - they're not

            <small>Before European settlement/invasion, Aboriginals generally, we
            are
            told, had a beautiful thing going - they really knew how to share. Each
            tribal group was a custodian of a traditional area, and all were taught
            how to look after and respect their ancestral land. They belonged to
            the Earth, and not the other way around. No individual owned any land,

            someone's distant ancestors, whom he never knew, got to a continent
            first, they claim ownership! The logic of this declaration is certainly
            worth examining. So then, what if new archeological evidence came to
            light which revealed that a certain Aboriginal clan are the sole
            descendants of the very first guy who crossed the Torres Strait? Could
            this clan then say, "OK all you whitefellas and blackfellas descended

            in Australia, or clear out!"</small><br>

            landed? Could the king who sent the ship have personally claimed
            ownership based on first occupancy, or would Australia more rightly
            belong to the ship's captain? But hang on! - what if one of the oarsmen
            jumped off the boat before the captain, and was first to hit the beach?
            But, wait! - the oarsman was wearing boots, and his skin never touched
            the soil until after the first mate slipped over on the beach and got a
            face full of sand!</small><br>

            of human rights. And there is a clear case in Australia for studying
            and acknowledging the shameful history of European invasion, saying
"Sorry" on behalf of our ancestors, and trying to make amends as best
            we can. If this means special programs, roles, and grants for
            Aboriginals in order to help them out of their appalling condition,
            then let's do it. And we should acknowledge Aboriginals being the first

<p>  Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
  Iconoclast, 1897</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, it is quite true that all
        taxes of whatever nature are paid out of the products of labor. But must
      they be for that reason a tax on labor products. Let us see. </p>
  <p>I suppose you
        won't
          deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds of land will give
      very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor produces on A's land 4,
      on
          B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the most, and D's is the least,
        productive land in use in the community to which they belong. B's and C's
      represent intermediate
          grades. Suppose each occupies the best land that was open to him when he
        entered into possession. Now, B, and C, and D have just as good a right to
        the use
          of the best land as A had. </p>
  <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story,
        there cannot be equality of opportunity where a unit of labor produces such
        different
            results, all other things being equal except the land. </p>
  <p>How is this equality
          to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each must surrender for
    the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages accrues to him
    from
        the possession
          of land superior to that which falls to the lot of him who occupies the
      poorest. </p>
  <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what
          it should
              produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage of natural
            opportunity over D. </p>
  <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C,
          1 into a common
                fund for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a
      well, making a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility.  </p>
  <p>Is
          it not manifest
                  that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common fund, and
      from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products (though paid out
        of them)
                but
                  a tax on the superior advantage which they enjoy over D, and to
      which
            D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
  <p>The result of this arrangement
          is that
                  each takes up as much of the best land open to him as he can
    put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use he leaves open for the next.
    Moreover,
            he
                is at no disadvantage with the rest who have come in ahead of him,
        for
            they provide
                  for him, in proportion to their respective advantages, those
    public utilities
                  which invariably arise wherever men live in communities. Of course
          he will in turn hold to those who come later the same relation that those
        who came
                  earlier held to him. </p>
  <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on
          labor products instead of land; all that any land-holder would have to
      do to avoid the
                  tax is to produce little or nothing. He could just squat on his
      land, neither using it himself nor letting others use it, but he would not
      stop
          at
              this,
                    for he
                      would grab to the last acre all that he could possibly get
      hold of. Each of the others would do the same in turn, with the sure result
      that
          by
              and
                  by,
                      E, F and G would find no land left for them on which they might
          make a living. </p>
  <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had
        already monopolized the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them.
          Behold now the
                    devil
                        of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit
      justice, freedom,
                        social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent,
                consuming grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism,
        crime
              breeding, want,
                        the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
  <p>And how did
          it all
                  come
                      about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor products in
      order that precious landlordism
                          might laugh and grow fat on the bovine stupidity of the
      community that contributes its own land values toward its own enslavement!  </p>
  <p>And
          yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What
                          difference does it make?&quot; </p>
  <p><em>O tempora! O mores!</em> To be as plain as is necessary,
                          it makes this four-fold difference. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, it robs the
              community of its land values; </li>
    <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the
            name of taxation; </li>
    <li>third,
                                      it sustains and fosters landlordism, a
      most conspicuously damnable difference; </li>
    <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced
              idleness; beholding their families
                                        in want on the one hand, and unused land
      that would yield them abundance on the other. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This last is a difference that
          cries to heaven
                  for vengeance, and
                                        if it does not always cry in vain, will
    W. C. Brann
                be able to draw his robe close around him and with a good conscience
            exclaim, &quot;It's
                none of my fault; I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>
