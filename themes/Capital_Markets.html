and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><strong>Another way in which a tax on land can be better than neutral
is
that
it can ameliorate imperfections in lending markets.&nbsp; Because
capital markets are not perfect, people vary with respect to the
discount rate that they apply to future taxes.&nbsp;</strong> The lower the
discount rate, the higher will be the present value that a person
assigns to future land tax payments.&nbsp; This means that an increase
in taxes on land will lower the bid prices of those with low discount
rates by more than it lowers the bid prices of those with high discount
rates.&nbsp; Thus an increase in taxes on land will tend to shift land
from people with low discount rates to people with high discount
rates.&nbsp; Since people with high discount rates get greater returns
from their assets, this increases economic output. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Measuring the Economic Gains
from Shifting Taxes to Land</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>There are three principal sources of economic gains from
shifting taxes
away from capital and labor and onto land:&nbsp; </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) The removal of
taxes from labor motivates people to make more efficient decisions
about how much to work; <br>
2) The removal of taxes from capital motivates
people to make more efficient decisions about how much to save; and <br>
3)
increasing taxes on land motivates people to speculate less in land,
increasing the amount of land available for current use.&nbsp; <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this
section I report estimates of the magnitudes of these effects, derived
from a general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. ...&nbsp; <a

  <p><b>How much growth can a community expect if it shifts taxes from improvements
  to land?</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Discussion: This is the subject of my current investigation in Pennsylvania.
      A number of other investigations have been made as well.
    </p>
    <p>One potential source of growth, discussed by Mason Gaffney, is that taxes
        on land that lower the selling price of land can be expected to make
      land relatively more attractive to persons who face high borrowing rates
      because
        of imperfections in capital markets. Gaffney suggests that such persons
        tend to be more entrepreneurial, so that giving them greater relative
      access to land will increase productive activity. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Structure.html">read the whole article</a></p>
