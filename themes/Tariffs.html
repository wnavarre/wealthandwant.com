<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Quite as fallacious is the idea that all property should be equally taxed,
    because equally protected. The fact is that all property is not equally protected,
    cannot be equally protected, and ought not to be equally protected, if by
    protection anything more is meant than the mere preservation of the peace.
    The protection of property is not the end, it is only one of the incidents,
    of government. As John Stuart Mill says: &quot;The ends of government are
    as comprehensive as those of the social union. They consist of all the good
    and all the immunity from evil which the existence of government can be made,
    either directly or indirectly, to bestow.&quot; And to say that government
    should impartially protect and equally tax all property, is like saying that
    the farmer should bestow the same care upon everything he may find growing
    in his fields, whether weeds or grain.</p>
  <p> That there is no obligation to equally tax all property is fully realized
    in regard to property brought from abroad. No one contends for a tariff which
    should equally tax all such property. The protectionists assert that the
    leading idea in determining what should be taxed and what not taxed, and
    the different rates which various imports should bear, ought to be the promotion
    of the general good by the encouragement and protection of industry. Their
    opponents, on the other hand, do not deny the propriety of such exemptions
    and discriminations. They merely deny that industry can be protected and
    encouraged by the endeavor to shield certain classes of producers from foreign
    competition; and, in the enactment of a purely revenue tariff, they would
    make the same kind of exemptions and discriminations, with a view to the
    collection of the revenue with the smallest cost and least interference with
    trade. Both parties equally recognize the general good as the true guiding
    principle in taxation of this kind. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

        IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon
      the production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every
    wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like
    removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would
    be felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates
    upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</strong></li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

      Wealth Harm America</small></a><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/debate_hyndman_1889.html"><small> (excerpt
      from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp; </small></a><small>(1883)</small> </small> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great Wealth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
    recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
    I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate than
    he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get
    his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced it than
    did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for the rest
    of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land in the
    early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable. His wealth
    represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of
    the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
    leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
    skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
    he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
    a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper labor
    of Europe," gave him the advantage of a sixty-per-cent tariff. To the day
    of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade would ruin
    our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to
    lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
    what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by the tariff
    that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth."</small>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
    and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account
    for all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
    first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it.
    But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
    fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money enough he
    used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran off opposition
    lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he went into railroads,
    pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working
    and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould
    might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial.
    But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions. It
    was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting
    up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values and
    transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which
    the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
    profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations of
    Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging.
    And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company,
    the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and
    the various rings for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper
    labor of Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of successful
    patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
    value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I
    am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
    in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
    out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
    through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes,
    these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
    of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me recently, "It
    is not on our ordinary business that we make our money; it is where we can
    get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
  <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
  of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
    their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
    ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
    of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
    pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
    was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
    by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get
    a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that
    it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which we
    give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by law and
    by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously rich while
    others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note the elements
    of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building up of all,
    or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous are those
    who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations and that
    the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities
    of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk
    as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
    restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the capitalist
    is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any one get
    as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution
    of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor
    in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the
    laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments
    which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that
    in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion
    to his contribution to the general stock. And in such a social state there
    would not be less incentive to exertion than now; there would be far more
    incentive. Men will be more industrious and more moral, better workmen and
    better citizens, if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his
    family, than where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them
    until some have far more than they could have earned, and others have little
    or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

  <p>The free trade movement in England was a necessary step in this direction.
      The men who took part in it did more than they knew. Striking at restrictions
      in the form of protection, aiming at emancipating trade by reducing tariffs
      to a minimum for revenue only, they aroused a spirit that yet goes further.
      There sits, in the person of my friend, Mr. Briggs [Thomas Briggs], one
    of the men of that time, one of the men who, not stopping, has always aimed
    a
      a larger freedom, one of the men who today hails what we in the United

  <p>HE term Land in political economy means the natural or passive element in
    production, and includes the whole external world accessible to man, with
    all its powers, qualities, and products, except perhaps those portions of
    it which are for the time included in man's body or in his products, and
    which therefore temporarily belong to the categories, man and wealth, passing
    again in their reabsorption by nature into the category, land. &#8212; <em>The

  </a><br>
THAT land is only a passive factor in production must be carefully kept in mind.
. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who
own land. . . . <br>
  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production
as landowners, and by virtue of that ownership, is as ridiculously impossible
as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

  <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the Bay of
    New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite the point
    where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers, board incoming steamers
    to ask strangers to take their first American swear, and where, if false
    oaths really colored the atmosphere the air would be bluer than is the sky
    on this gracious day. I turn from my writing-machine to the window, and drink
    in, with a pleasure that never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

THE protection of the masses has in all times been the pretense of tyranny &#8212; the
plea of monarchy, of aristocracy, of special privilege of every kind. The slave
owners justified slavery as protecting the slaves. British misrule in Ireland
is upheld on the ground that it is for the protection of the Irish. But, whether
under a monarchy or under a republic, is there an instance in the history of
the world in which the "protection" of the laboring masses has not meant their
oppression? The protection that those who have got the law-making power into
their hands have given labor, has at best always been the protection that man
gives to cattle &#8212; he protects them that he may use and eat them. &#8212; <em>Protection

IT is never intimated that the land-owner or the capitalist needs protection.
They, it is always assumed, can take care of themselves. It is only the poor
workingman who must be protected. What is labor that it should so need protection?
Is not labor the creator of capital, the producer of all wealth? Is it not the
men who labor that feed and clothe all others? Is it not true, as has been said,
that the three great orders of society are "workingmen, beggarmen, and thieves?" How,
then, does it come that workingmen alone need protection? &#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 2, Clearing Ground&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT2.html">econlib </a>-|- <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/trade/pft2.htm">abridged</a><br>
            <br>
WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a country which
should compel each family to keep constantly on their guard against every other
family, to expend a large part of their time and labor in preventing exchanges
with their neighbors, and to seek their own prosperity by opposing the natural
efforts of other families to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies
that laws such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families of
men who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws, as immutable
as the physical laws, each nation must stand jealously on guard against every
other nation and erect artificial obstacles to national intercourse.&#8212; <em>Protection

            <br>
TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying from other
nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make a man prosperous by preventing
him from buying from other men. How this operates in the case of the individual
we can see from that practice which, since its application in the Irish land
agitation, has come to be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has
been thrust the unenviable fame of having his name turned into a verb, was in
fact "protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind built
around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act of Parliament. No
one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk or bread or meat or any
service or commodity whatever. But instead of growing prosperous, this much-protected
man had to fly from a place where his own market was thus reserved for his own
productions. What protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home
market for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain Boycott.
They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

            <br>
WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to take a certain
course is proof that it ought to take that course, and restrictions are harmful
because they restrict, and in proportion as they restrict. To assert that the
way for men to become healthy and strong is for them to force into their stomachs
what nature tries to reject, to regulate the play of their lungs by bandages,
or to control the circulation of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit
more absurd than to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them
to restrict the natural tendency to trade. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

  <p>"COME with me," said Richard Cobden, as John Bright turned heart-stricken
    from a new-made grave. "There are in England women and children dying with
    hunger &#8212; with hunger made by the laws. Come with me, and we will not
    rest until we repeal those laws." <br>
            <br>
In this spirit the free trade movement waxed and grew, arousing an enthusiasm
that no mere fiscal reform could have aroused. And intrenched though it was by
restricted suffrage and rotten boroughs and aristocratic privilege, protection
was overthrown in Great Britain. <br>
            <br>
And &#8212; there is hunger in Great Britain still, and women and children yet
die of it. <br>
            <br>
But this is not the failure of free trade. When protection had been abolished
and a revenue tariff substituted for a protective tariff, free trade had only
won an outpost. That women and children still die of hunger in Great Britain
arises from the failure of the reformers to go on. Free trade has not yet been
tried in Great Britain. Free trade in its fulness and entirety would indeed abolish
hunger. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 26: True Free
Trade - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT26.html">econlib</a> -|- <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/trade/pft20.htm">abridged</a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
    tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous application
    of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak of it as free
    trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than
    a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not merely abolish
all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, what is the effect on
production of taxes levied on
products and of taxes levied on the value of land? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of taxes levied on products,
George said: "The present method of
taxation operates upon exchange like artificial deserts and
mountains; it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it
does to carry them around the world. It operates upon energy, and
industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities. If
I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me
more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while
you are exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his
temerity, as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad
be opened, down comes the taxcollector upon it, as though it were a
public nuisance; if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an
annual sum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say
we want capital, but if anyone accumulate it, or bring it among us,
we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We
punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
grain, we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.
How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have
attempted to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications,
for, as I have before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that
which falls in increased prices" (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 434). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turning to taxation levied on the
value of land, George went on to
say: </small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For this simple device of placing
    all taxes on the value of land
    would be in effect putting up the land at auction to whosoever would
    pay the highest rent to the state. The demand for land fixes its
    value, and hence, if taxes were placed so as very nearly to consume
    that value, the man who wished to hold land without using it would
    have to pay very nearly what it would be worth to anyone who wanted
    to use it. </small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And it must be remembered that
    this would apply, not merely to
    agricultural land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open
    to use, just as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one
    could afford to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the
    outskirts to demand more for it than the use to which it could at the
    time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had attained a value,
    taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
    would operate to force improvement (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 437). </small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A few pages before this he had
told us that, "It is sufficiently
evident that with regard to production, the tax upon the value of
land is the best tax that can be imposed. Tax manufactures, and the
effect is to check manufacturing; tax improvements, and the effect is
to lessen improvement; tax commerce, and the effect is to prevent
exchange; tax capital, and the effect is to drive it away. But the
whole value of land may be taken in taxation, and the only effect
will be to stimulate industry, to open new opportunities to capital,
and to increase the production of wealth" (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 414).
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In other words, according to
George, taxation of products checks
production, whereas taxation of land values stimulates
production.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>George was moreover the terror of the political routineer. When the Republicans
      suddenly raised the tariff issue in 1880 the Democratic committee asked him
      to go on the stump. They arranged a long list of engagements for him, but after
      he made one speech they begged him by telegraph not to make any more. The nub
      of his speech was that he had heard of high-tariff Democrats and revenue-tariff
      Democrats, but he was a no-tariff Democrat who wanted real free trade, and
      he was out for that or nothing; and naturally no good bi-partisan national
      committee could put up with such talk as that, especially from a man who really
      meant it.</p>
  <p>Yet, on the other hand, when the official free-traders of the Atlantic seaboard,
      led by Sumner, Godkin, Beecher, Curtis, Lowell, and Hewitt, opened their
    arms to George, he refused to fall in. His free-trade speeches during Cleveland&#8217;s
      second campaign were really devoted to showing by implication that they were
      a hollow lot, and that their idea of free trade was nothing more or less than
      a humbug. His speeches hurt Cleveland more than they helped him, and some of
      George&#8217;s closest associates split with him at this point. In George&#8217;s
      view, freedom of exchange would not benefit the masses of the people a
      particle unless it were correlated with freedom of production; if it would,
      how was
      it that the people of free-trade England, for example, were no better off
      than the people of protectionist Germany! None of the official free-traders
      could
      answer that question, of course, for there was no answer. George had already
      developed his full doctrine of trade in a book, published in 1886, called <em>Protection
      or Free Trade</em> &#8212; a book which, incidentally, gives a reader the
      best possible introduction to <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a><br>
