<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A little Island or a little World</span></p>
  <p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming
    in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
    the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
    while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
    primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
  <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and
    look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
    multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
    even supposing there have been no important inventions or
    improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
    causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
    During this time some of these people will have been careless,
    generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
    of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
    they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
    inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
    their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
    pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
    trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
    fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
    things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
    happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
    again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
    possessions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What, then,
    shall we see, land having been all this time
    treated as private property?</span> Clearly, we shall see that the
    primitive
    equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
    than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
    many will have no land at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Suppose
    that, in all things save this,
    our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
    no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
    taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
    imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
    utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
    produced poverty and virtual slavery.</span></p>
  <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to
    say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
    live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
    make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
    to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
    have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
    land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
    rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
    absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
    only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
    land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
    his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
    everything as he wills.</p>
  <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so
    far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
    land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
    competition between them as well as between those who have only their
    labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
    will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
    Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
    produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
    factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
    factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
    as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
    these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
    very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
    his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
    labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
    it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
    laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
    making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
    over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
    pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
    urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
    the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
    are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
    larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
    produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
    steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
    of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
    effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
    constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
    give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
    same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
    work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
    little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
    of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
    the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
    would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
  <p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
    suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
    steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
    reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
    are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
  <p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is
    to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
    same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
    amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
    the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
    something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
    to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
    invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
    this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
    being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
    proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
    the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
    inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
    dependent.</p>
  <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving
    inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
    perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
    away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
    to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
    else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
    continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
    the landowners!

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall?<strong> Is it not a plain promise that if Rent
    be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps
    in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? </strong>Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>
