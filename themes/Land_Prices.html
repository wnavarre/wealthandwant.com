        Speculation Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or
            as a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
            of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot
            be ignored in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive
            countries. It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly
            to increase rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production,
            and thus constantly tends, as material progress goes on and productive
            power increases, to reduce wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely.</p>
    </div>
  <div align="left">The cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency
    of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative
    advance
          in land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can
    neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price
    of
          land, in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition
    of engaging in production. If it were possible continuously to reduce wages
          until zero were reached, it would be possible continuously to increase
          rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be
    permanently
          reduced below the point at which laborers will consent to work and
    reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital will be devoted
    to production,
          there is a limit which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence
          speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries
    where wages and interest are already near the minimum, as in countries where
          they are considerably above it. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The truth is, that the completion of
                the railroad and the consequent great increase of business and population,
                will not be a
      benefit to all of us, but only to a portion.</span> As a general rule (liable
      of course to exceptions) those who <span
 style="font-style: italic;">have</span> it will make
      wealthier; for those who <span style="font-style: italic;">have not</span>, it
      will make it more difficult to get. Those who have lands, mines, established
      businesses, special abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and
      find increased opportunities; those who have only their own labor will be come
      poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first, because it will take more capital
      to buy land or to get into business; and second, because as competition reduces
      the wages of labor, this capital will
      be harder for them to obtain.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>What, for instance, does the rise in land mean? Several things, but
              certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future for
              a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of the
              State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a dollar
              an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In other words,
              the settler who last year might have had at once a farm of his own, must
              now either go to work on wages for some one else, pay rent or buy on
              time; in either case being compelled to give to the capitalist a large
              proportion of the earnings which, had he arrived a year ago, he might
              have had all for of himself. And as proprietorship is thus rendered more
              difficult and less profitable to the poor, more are forced into the labor
              market to compete with each other, and cut down the rate of wages --
              that is, to make the division of their joint production between labor
              and capital more in favor of capital and less in favor of labor.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">And so in San Francisco the rise in building lots means, that it will
              be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and if he
              has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for rent; means
              a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies courts, slums, tenement-houses,
              squalor and vice.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco has one great advantage
                &#8212; there is probably a larger proportion of her population
                owning homesteads and homestead lots than in any other city of
                the United States.</span> The
                product of the rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed,
                and the great social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship
                cannot be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the
                princely domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">pueblo </span>was
                not appropriated to furnishing free, or almost free, homesteads to
                actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into the hands of
                a few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been taken up in time
                and in a proper spirit, this disposition might easily have been secured,
                and the great city of the future would have had a population bound
                to her by the strongest ties -- a population better, freer, more virtuous,
                independent and public spirited than any great city the world has ever
                had.</p>
      </div>

  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> To say that "Power is constantly stealing
        from the many to the few," is only to state in another form the law that
        wealth tends to concentration. In the new era into which the world has
        entered since the application of steam,
        this law is more potent than ever; in the new era into which California
        is entering, its operations will be more marked here than ever before.
        The locomotive is a
        great centralizer. It kills towns and builds up great cities, and in
        the same way kills little businesses and builds up great ones. We have
        had comparatively
        but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning "very rich" has in
        these times. But the process is going on. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The great city that is to be will have its Astors,
        Vanderbilts, Stewarts and Spragues, and he who looks a few years ahead
        may even now read
        their names as he passes along Montgomery, California or Front
        streets.&nbsp;</span> With the protection which property gets in modern
        times -- with stocks, bonds, burglar-proof safes and policemen; with
        the railroad and
        the telegraph, after a man gets a certain amount of money it is plain
        sailing, and he need take no risks. Astor said that to get his first
        thousand dollars
        was his toughest struggle; but when one gets a million, if he has ordinary
        prudence, how much he will
        have is only a question of life. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nor
        can we rely on the absence of laws of primogeniture and entail to dissipate
        these large
        fortunes so menacing to the general weal. Any large fortune will, of
        course, become dissipated in time, even in spite of laws of primogeniture
        and entail;
        but every aggregation of wealth implies and necessitates others, and
        so that the aggregations remain, it matters little in
        what particular hands. </span>Stewart, in the natural course of things,
        will die before long, and being childless, his wealth will be dissipated,
        or at least
        go out of the dry goods business. But will this avail the smaller dealers
        whom he has crushed or is crushing out? Not at all. Some one else will
        step in, take
        his place in the trade, and run the great money-making machine which
        he has organized, or some other similar one. Stewart and other great
        houses have concentrated the
        business, and
        it will remain concentrated. ... <a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">read the whole article</a></div>

railroad grants. (Hear, hear.) They come from the system permitted
under the land-laws of the United States, under which single
individuals have taken hundreds of thousands of acres. And from the
same cause comes the mortgage on the farms. Wherever the farmer goes
he finds the speculator ahead of him, he finds the land already taken
up, and he must either start with capital and pay a large sum for the
purpose of getting virgin soil to cultivate, or he must mortgage his
labour for years. That is what he does. (Hear; hear.) The real cause
is in the high purchase price, of his land, and that is why times
have been getting harder in the United States. Then I am asked, how
can a man using a spade compete with this great machinery of the

a good living, too; and when men can make a good living themselves

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>

        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>

        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason

        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain

  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>

        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is

        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard

          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress

  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals

and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> For
a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.</span>&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest
taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Land?</span></small><br>
<small>David Ricardo defined land, memorably, as &#8216;the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.&#8217;&nbsp; This definition is overly
narrow.&nbsp; It would exclude from land such valuable and
destruc&shy;tible things as minerals and topsoil. Ricardo&#8217;s definition
even suggests that the value of land arising from urban locations might
not be included in &#8216;land,&#8217; since it would not necessarily qualify as a
&#8216;power of the soil.&#8217;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The definition of land that is most useful in economic theory is
that
land is all scarce factors of production other than people and the
products of human effort. Land is the gifts of nature.&nbsp; Thus land
includes both rural and urban territory, mineral resources, water, fish
in oceans and rivers, virgin forests, geosynchronous orbits and the
frequency spectrum.</small><br>
<br>
<small>While there is some tendency to think of measuring land in
&#8216;stock&#8217;
terms (&#8216;What is the value of that piece of land?&#8217;), the flow of
services from land is more fundamental.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While capital goods have
selling prices related to their costs of production, such a calculation
does not apply to land since, by definition, land is not
produced.&nbsp; The selling price of land is conceived in economic
theory as the present value of the net return after taxes to the future
flow of land services, when the land is used in the way that maximizes
that present value.</span>&nbsp; Following David Ricardo, the value of
the
flow of services from land is sometimes described as the residual after
paying other factors their opportunity costs, when land is used
efficiently.&nbsp; But in equilibrium, a similar statement can be made
about any other factor. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>A rise in the rate of taxation of land reduces the potential
profit
from speculating in land because it reduces the selling price of
land.&nbsp; Thus a rise in land taxes reduces the speculative demand
for land (the number of pounds per month that a speculator is willing
to pay in interest in taxes to hold a parcel of land with given
prospects in his mind), but a rise in land taxes does not reduce the
number of pounds per month that a current user of land is willing to
pay in interest in taxes for current use of land.&nbsp; Thus a tax on
land shifts land from speculators to current users, thereby reducing
the tendency toward an artificial scarcity of land from
speculation. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>And by
taxing land, society impels owners who had been speculatively
withholding or underutilizing theirs to develop or offer their parcels
for development. Hence the newly-available land comes from recycled
sites, not from open space.<br>
<br>
The PTS not only lowers the price of land, it also lowers the cost of
buildings. Untaxing structures, besides reducing their cost, also
augments their supply. More buildings means lower prices and rents. As
the prices of both buildings and land drop, more people are able to
purchase a home, apartment, or condominium.<br>
<br>
Ethically, the PTS simplifies the revenue system, leaving fewer
decisions to be made by politicians in favor of their backers. All the
essential facts are open to public scrutiny: the land's owner, value,
use, and levy. And since mere speculation would no longer be
profitable, owners would have less monetary motive to try to unduly
influence the political process.<strong> ...</strong> <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS
would replace
is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
owners for improving. This negative incentive does its greatest damage
at the margin, where profit is slim. There, rather than pay a higher
tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums. The lack of much tax
on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.<br>
<br>
Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land. Leap-frog
development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. The resultant
sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
<br>
The PTS reverses all these negative consequences.

construction, taxing only land spares it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread
development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it
(providing a market for mass transit).

  <li><small><font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rather
than inflate land price,
a land tax squashes it. </span>    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of
prime sites or
itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected site rent
as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher, making home
ownership inflation-proof.</small></font></small></li>

<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that

elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next

all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm. <strong>... </strong></small></p>

to Help the
Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)</small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>... Yet why is it that men able to work and willing to work
cannot
find work?&nbsp; ..</small><br>
<br>
<small> For the question of the unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>... So that, whether we begin at the right or the
wrong end, any analysis brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
opportunities of finding employment and the rate of all wages depend
ultimately upon the freedom of access to land; the price that labor
must pay for its use....</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>... Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of
American farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the
first form of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are
landless men, without right to employ their own labor and without stake
in the land they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the
reason why the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by
pauperism has already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in
more dangerous type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These recurring spasms of business stagnation; these long-drawn
periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do not
come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to be
cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and what
is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but speculation
in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor and capital
would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail demanded for
their employment in production, and the same round would be run again. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is but one remedy, and that is what
is now known as the single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor
and capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and
the taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to
the mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. </span>Charity
can merely demoralize and pauperize, while that indirect form of
charity, the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public
expenses and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more
dangerous. If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more
quickly by dynamite and kerosene.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But there is no need for charity; no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective demand"
for the things he desires would infuse new life into every subdivision
of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the preacher, the
magazine writer, or the actor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The country is suffering from "scarcity of employment." But let
anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or in
erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to demand
of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
common-sense way to cure "scarcity of employment" is to take taxes off
the products and processes of employment and to impose in their stead
the tax that would end speculation in land.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But, it will be said, this is
not quick enough. On the contrary, it is quicker than anything else.
Even the public recognition of its need, by but a part of the
intelligence and influence that is now devoted to charity appeals and
schemes, would have such an effect upon the speculative price of land
as to at once set labor and capital to work.&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">Who Says Cities are Poor? They Just
Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary economics
      starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production in the
      creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive and,
      taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value. The
      first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called land.
      Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied; it meant
      not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth. Today sunlight,
      radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added. The second factor
      of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort applied by people's
      minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product of past application
      of land and labor to current production: capital. Each factor in classical
      economics has its price, the product of which is the creation of wealth as
      we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages; the price of capital
      is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as understood in economics,
      is not payment for the use of property owned by others; it has, rather, a more
      technical meaning, one which will require greater explication below.</p>
  <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
    and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of
    taxation
      with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
      building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor
    continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course
    of a shift
      from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had
    earlier encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212; the
      product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land
    by itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
      altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
      formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
  <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and rent
        as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the surplus
        produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
        to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form of
        taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by shifting
        taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance of markets
        would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless to taxpayers.
        This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now possible to demonstrate
        with the advent of computer power and available data. It amplifies and validates
        what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical claim. We can now
        show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the services demanded
        of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that exceeds all others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And
        unlike other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive. Economic
        rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates through the
        markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
        result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price. Economic
        rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason, and comes
        about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by the consequence
        rather of society's collective effort. British political economist David Ricardo
        first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to agricultural production
        in the early 1800s, but its applicability today is understood far more easily
        with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas ground rent to Ricardo reflected
        the differential gifts of nature inherent in various land sites, it is today
        better understood as reflective of locational differentials in the capacities
        of communities.</p>
  <p>This is relatively easy to understand by considering a vacant expanse of
          land that has imposed upon it a grid of roads like a tic-tac-toe board.
      Suppose each of the squares were privately owned, and development of those
      sites were
        to ensue, the economic surplus generated by that market activity would
    raise the value of each of those locations. Let's further suppose that every
    site
        were developed except the center square, that titleholder choosing instead
        to just hold his title vacant. Which land site, discounting the building
      values, would command the greatest market price after a short time? The
    center square,
        of course &#8212; even though that owner made no effort to earn that
        increase in price. The center square would see the greatest accretion
        of economic
        rent because of its strategic access. It would be the passive beneficiary
        of the
        surplus generated by the common enterprise of all the market exchanges
        resulting from the other locations. In just this way rent becomes the
        social creation
        of the community and not the result of any private individual's enterprise.
        The more the economic activity, the more the surplus generated comes
        to settle on land in the form of rent. Rent accretes to land sites and
        raises their
        market value, directly reflecting the varying levels of productive economic
        surplus
        generated over time throughout a community. High economic productivity
        yields high surplus rent.</p>
  <p>If one plots the land value per unit area, whether by square foot, acre, hectare,
      or square mile, as is now possible to easily do using modern computer programs,
      the differential land values are easy to approximate. Typically the center
      of a city experiences the peak land value, with a precipitous decline as one
      leaves the center and departs to its outer edge. The highest value locations
      are the commercial cores, falling quickly as one travels out to residential
      locations, and with agricultural and forest lands having only a small fraction
      of the value commanded at the center. In areas of New York City, the market
      price of locations has been shown to be in the vicinity of $500 million per
      acre. Even in smaller cities, there is little realization of the enormous cost
      of sites in core areas: in downtown Des Moines, the price per acre was $31.5
      million. Other illustrations are easily available, particularly in urban areas
      on the east and west coasts of the US. Taking another perspective, the urbanized
      center of Tompkins County, New York (Ithaca) is five percent of the land area
      but contains ninety-five percent of the land value.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8] </em></strong></font>To
      see where the land values are highest, it is easiest to look at a city's skyline.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
      tallest buildings sit on the most expensive land parcels. Typically the aggregate
      land value of a city is about 40 percent of the combined market value of land
      and improvements. The proportion of overall land value to building value is
      revealed by that profile, known as a landvaluescape<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[10]</em></strong></font> Some
      buildings will exceed that proportion &#8212; a large investment on a small
      footprint; other sites may be vacant or depreciated buildings with a far
      smaller land to building ratio. The dynamic at work here is easily understood:
      the
      greater a land site's value the greater the incentive to take advantage
      of its location; following the same logic, the more intensive the investments
      in particular neighborhoods the greater market value of remaining or underused
      land sites, making any locations that are underutilized good candidates
      for
      improvement. So it is that downtowns generate land values many times those
      of farther reaches; each investment development fosters others.</p>
  <p>The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the economic
      rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes to settle
      on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market price of
      sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced ground rent
      in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect on sites but could
      be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the services that cities are
      bound to perform. As will be evident below, the amount of economic rent available
      for recovery is thought sufficient to pay for all services and then some. Today
      it simply collects on sites of greatest activity with typical and visible negative
      consequences.</p>
  <p>One might suppose that collecting the economic rent would leave locational
      sites with less market price appreciation, stabilizing land prices at levels
      that are more within reach for various developments. To be sure collecting
      economic rent exerts a downward pressure on market prices. But there is a countervailing
      pressure that works to neutralize whatever tendencies are otherwise at work:
      the collection of rent, especially from high-value sites, increases the carrying
      costs in ways that provides a greater inducement for their titleholders to
      improve them. That incentive fosters development in areas that, together in
      combination with other activity generated in neighborhoods, tends to maintain
      the stability of land markets in a roughly constant pattern.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
      state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
      with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation.</p>
  <p>One must be careful not to confuse land-value with the price of land. The
      price of land is the sum demanded for the transference from one individual
      to another of the privilege to collect and retain land-value and thus to divert
      public earnings to private pockets. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He understood
that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. </span>And because government was taxing labor and capital
instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
