          Justice</small></small></a> </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our problem today, as yesterday,
      and the days before, back to the
      earliest recorded times, is POVERTY.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are times when this problem
      is lesser. We call these
"booms." There are also times when the problem is greatly
      exacerbated. These are called "busts." But, as the Bible says, "the
      poor have ye always with ye."</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The purpose of this paper is to
      explore the core of the problem.
      It is not the position that there is only one single error afoot in
      our social organizations. There may be several, there may be only a
      few things to remedy. The position is, as stated earlier, that there
      is one basic cause of the problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
      the removal of this one
      basic error is the first, the primary step, for the simple reason
      that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
      will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust cycles until
      the economies of the whole world are wrecked by inflation or by a
      nuclear war triggered by the ongoing economic disaster.</span></small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
      likely causes of our troubles by
      asking two questions: 
    </small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
          </small></li>
        <li><small>Are the earth's
      resources inadequate for this population?&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></li>
        </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In our economy, land is a ready
      object of speculation, and its
      value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
      market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
      prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
      increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
      present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
      current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
      today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
      The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
      imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
      rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
      threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
      passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
      The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
      back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
      the new boom will have started.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1933, the University of Chicago
      published a book by <a href="Hoyt.html">Homer Hoyt</a>      entitled <b><i>One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago</i></b>.
      This monumental study consists in 7 chapters, of which each of the
      first five describes one of the five major business cycles of the
      period in great detail.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was so outstanding about
      Hoyt's book was its compelling
      confirmation of George's analysis, some thirty-five years after
      George's death in 1897! What is even more significant is Hoyt's
      handling of his data in chapters six and seven, the balance of the
      study. In these two chapters, he selects some sixteen events which
      not only are present in each cycle, but which occur in the same order
      in each cycle.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr. Hoyt concluded with the usual
      caveat: that the mere fact that
      this sequence is observed this many times does not guarantee that it
      will ever happen again; which is to say that we can never prove
      truth, we can only fail to disprove it.</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a
 href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/monroe-john-1962.jpg">graphic
      rendition</a> of one such cycle appearing on the following page was
      devised by John Monroe, the Director of the Commerce and Industry
      Division of the Chicago Henry George School of Social Science. For
      classroom use, Mr. Monroe had set up a large magnetized blackboard
      with a large inverted "U"; the sixteen items of the figure were
      described on sixteen magnetized chips, which were shuffled and
      distributed along the participants. The author once had a
      class of five company presidents; after defining the task, he never
      spoke during the exercise. The individual members had sole control as
      to the place on the curve where each chip belonged. It was thrilling
      to see and hear the discussion and the ultimate positioning of the
      individual chips. At completion, they matched precisely the
      historically-based results of Hoyt. Five converts, one of whom had
      been the President both of Chicago's Real Estate Board and of its
      Building Managers Association, as well as a trustee of the University
      of Chicago, walked out of that session.</small></div>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are banks
      which have gone under
      supporting rising land
      prices, loaning money on land at speculative price levels. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The answer
      is not to rescue those banks; it is to rid ourselves of the
      fundamental process of speculation in land values.</span></small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The wringing out of land
      speculation from the dynamics of
      economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which has so
      labored the economic profession and the public at large. As Henry
      George discovered and as Homer Hoyt so brilliantly depicted
      speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle, so will
      its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It will put
      the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the terrible
      risks to which that market has always been subject in the past.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason for such speculation
      under the present practices is
      obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or decreases
      depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any commodity
      begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and production is
      thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward. Land, on the
      other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can increase or
      decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that operates
      in the field of production does not apply to land values and
      prices.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just think of the social benefits
      that would accrue to a society
      that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential hazards to which
      all prior societies have been so subject. Production will then occur
      on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the well-being of
      society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions are made,
      and all these will be benefits to the community as a whole, and not
      just to the land-owners as in the past.&nbsp; ... <a

  <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I wish clearly to bring to view
    this point. The Irish famine was
    not a true famine arising from scarcity of food. It was what an
    English writer styled the Indian famine &#8211; a "financial famine,"
    arising not from scarcity of food but from the poverty of the people.
    The effect of the short crops in producing distress was not so much
    in raising the price of food as in cutting off the accustomed incomes
    of the people. The masses of the Irish people get so little in
    ordinary times that they are barely able to live, and when anything
    occurs to interrupt their accustomed incomes they have nothing to
    fall back on.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet is this not true of large
    classes in all countries? And are
    not all countries subject to just such famines as this Irish famine?
    Good seasons and bad seasons are in the order of nature, just as the
    day of sunshine and the day of rain, the summer's warmth and the
    winter's snow. But agriculture is, on the whole, as certain as any
    other pursuit, for even those industries which may be carried en
    regardless of weather are subject to alternations as marked as those
    to which agriculture is liable. There are good seasons and bad
    seasons even in fishing and hunting, while the alternations are very
    marked in mining and in manufacturing. In fact, the more highly
    differentiated branches of industry which advancing civilization
    tends to develop, though less directly dependent upon rain and
    sunshine, heat and cold, seem increasingly subject to alternations
    more frequent and intense. Though in a country of more diversified
    industry the failure of a crop or two could not have such wide-spread
    effects as in Ireland, yet the countries of more complex industries
    are liable to a greater variety of disasters. A war on another
    continent produces famine in Lancashire; Parisian milliners decree a
    change of fashion, and Coventry operatives are saved from starvation
    only by public alms; a railroad combination decides to raise the
    price of coal, and Pennsylvania miners find their earnings diminished
    by half or totally cut off; a bank breaks in New York, and in all the
    large American cities soup-houses must be opened!</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this Irish famine which
    provoked the land agitation, there is
    nothing that is peculiar. Such famines on a smaller or a larger scale
    are constantly occurring. Nay, more! the fact is, that famine, just
    such famine as this Irish famine, constantly exists in the richest
    and most highly civilized lands. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It
    persists even in "good times"
    'when trade is "booming;" it spreads and rages whenever from any
    cause industrial depression comes.</span> It is kept under, or at least
    kept
    from showing its worst phases, by poor-rates and almshouses, by
    private benevolence and by vast organized charities, but it still
    exists, gnawing in secret when it does not openly rage. In the very
    centers of civilization, where the machinery of production and
    exchange is at the highest point of efficiency, where bankvaults hold
    millions, and show-windows flash with more than a prince's ransom,
    where elevators and warehouses are gorged with grain, and markets are
    piled with all things succulent and toothsome, where the dinners of
    Lucullus are eaten every day, and, if it be but cool, the very
    greyhounds wear dainty blankets&#8211;in these centers in wealth and
    power and refinement, there are always hungry men and women and
    little children. Never the sun goes down but on human beings prowling
    like wolves far food, or huddling together like vermin for shelter
    and warmth. "Always with You" is the significant heading under which
    a New York paper, in these most prosperous times, publishes daily the
    tales of chronic famine; and in the greatest and richest city in the
    world&#8211;in that very London where the plenty of meat in the
    butchers' shops seemed to some savages the most wondrous of all its
    wonderful sights&#8211;in that very London, the mortuary reports have
    a standing column for deaths by starvation.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But no more in its chronic than in
    its spasmodic forms is famine
    to be measured by the deaths from starvation. Perfect, indeed, in all
    its parts must be the human machine if it can run till the last bit
    of available tissue be drawn to feed its fires. It is under the guise
    of disease to which physicians can give less shocking names, that
    famine&#8211;especially the chronic famine of civilization&#8211;kills.
    And the statistics of mortality, especially of infant mortality, show
    that in the richest communities famine is constantly at its work.
    Insufficient nourishment, inadequate warmth and clothing, and
    unwholesome surroundings, constantly, in the very centers of plenty,
    swell the death-rates. What is this but famine &#8211; just such famine
    as the Irish famine? It is not that the needed things are really
    scarce; but that those whose need is direst have not the means to get
    them, and, when not relieved by charity, want kills them in its
    various ways. When, in the hot midsummer, little children die like
    flies in the New York tenement wards, what is that but famine? And
    those barges crowded with such children that a noble and tender
    charity sends down New York Harbor to catch the fresh salt breath of
    the Antlantic &#8211; are they not fighting famine as truly as were our
    food-laden war-ship and the Royal Prince's gunboats? Alas! to find
    famine one has not to cross the sea.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There was bitter satire in the
    cartoon that one of our illustrated
    papers published when subscriptions to the Irish famine fund were
    being made &#8211; a cartoon that represented James Gordon Bennett
    sailing away for Ireland in a boat loaded down with provisions, while
    a sad-eyed, hungry-looking, tattered group gazed wistfully on them
    from the pier. The bite and the bitterness of it, the humiliating
    sting and satire of it, were in its truth.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is "the home of freedom," and
"the asylum of the oppressed;"
    our population is yet sparse, our public domain yet wide; we are the
    greatest of food producers, yet even here there are beggars, tramps,
    paupers, men torn by anxiety for the support of their families, women
    who know not which way to turn, little children growing up in such
    poverty and squalor that only a miracle can keep them pure. "Always
    with you," even here. What is the week or the day of the week that
    our papers do not tell of man or woman who, to escape the tortures of
    want, has stepped out of life unbidden? What is this but famine?... <span

    <blockquote>
      <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for
        social needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God
        in the sense that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort
        of men to do things other than in the way he has intended; in the sense
        that where the blessings he proffers to men are refused or misused they
        turn to evils that scourge us. And just as for the mother to withhold
        the provision that fills her breast with the birth of the child is to
        endanger physical health, so for society to refuse to take for social
        uses the provision intended for them is to breed social disease.</p>
      <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
        to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
        by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
        It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego
        the only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to
        combine the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with
        the equality of natural opportunity that is the most important of all
        natural rights. It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up
        an unjust inequality between man and man, compelling some to pay others
        for the privilege of living, for the chance of working, for the advantages
        of civilization, for the gifts of their God. But it is even more than
        this. The very robbery that the masses of men thus suffer gives rise
        in advancing communities to a new robbery. For the value that with the
        increase of population and social advance attaches to land being suffered
        to go to individuals who have secured ownership of the land, it prompts
        to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever there is any prospect
        of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus producing an artificial
        scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor, <em><strong>and a strangulation
        of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial depression
        as disastrous to the world as destructive wars.</strong></em> It is this
        that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries, only
        to bring there
        the same curses. It is this that causes our material advance not merely
        to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but to make the
        condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that in our richest
        Christian countries is giving us a large population whose lives are harder,
        more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest savages. It is
        this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler and is constantly
        bringing more people into his world than he has made provision for; or
        that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
        the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

        of the sick patient, as distinct from remedies that dope the patient into

              the midst of idle billions of hoarded money and unused credit, as well
              as factories and mills deteriorating for lack of use, of hunger while farmers

      <p>No wonder people are asking what sort of a crazy economic system we have
              when at a time when millions are short of adequate food, when babies are
              going without the milk necessary for their growth, the best remedy that
              experts can think of and that the Federal Government can recommend is to
              pay a premium to farmers to grow less grain with which to make flour to
              feed the hungry, and pay a premium to dairymen to send less milk to market.</p>

      <p>Henry George called attention to this situation
        over fifty years ago. The contradiction between increasing plenty, increase
        of potential security--and
              actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief
        work, Progress and Poverty. That is what his book is about. It is a record
        of
        the fact
              that as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty
        and insecurity also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires
        and
              tramps multiply together. It is a prediction of why this state
        of affairs will continue; it is a prediction of the plight in which the
        nation
        finds
              itself today. At the same time it is the explanation of why this

      <p>Go to the work of Henry George himself and learn how many of the troubles
              from which society still suffers, and suffers increasingly, are due to
              the fact that a few have monopolized the land, and that in consequence
              they have the power to dictate to others access to the land and to its
              products -- which include waterpower, electricity, coal, iron and all minerals,
              as well as the foods that sustain life -- and that they have the power
              to appropriate to their private use the values that the industry, the civilized
              order, the very benefactions, of others produce. This wrong is at the very
              basis of our present social and economic chaos, and until it is righted,

          on predictable and stable financial support, particularly education,
          health, and public safety.&nbsp; With revenue streams based on formulas
          that vacillate from year to year, it becomes difficult to provide for
          public needs, and the continual political struggle over fiscal designs

          stabilizing effect of taxes on Land in the form of economic rent
          collection is shown best by the fact that those nations and states that

    <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Perfect Tax</strong></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In the final analysis, a tax should be evaluated
        according to the tenets of sound tax theory that have evolved over the
        course of recent centuries,
              and much of what has been said above is recaptured by a review
        of those principles. These measures of what is a &quot;good&quot; tax or a &quot;bad&quot; tax
              are often listed differently in textbooks, but they are largely agreed
              upon. Failure to conform to these venerable benchmarks is by itself sufficient
              cause to explain an economy's faltering &#8212; a particularly
              noteworthy example today is the city of Philadelphia which appears
              to have done
              everything backward! It taxes income, sales, building capital and
              even business privilege,
              the result being that its fisc is destitute.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> The
              principles by which to measure tax design are enumerated here so
              as to make quite clear how recapturing economic rent in the form
              of taxes &#8212; in
              all the several forms where 'land' can be identified &#8212; constitutes
              the best method of financing government services and the most advantageous
              to cities.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[21]</em></strong></font></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The first measure of a good tax is its neutrality.
        A neutral tax in no way alters the behavior of its partners from what
        would transpire were
              there no tax at all. A simple example illustrates the case: today
        many consumers will travel to alternate jurisdictions to avoid paying
        a sales
              tax on particular items, be they food, medication, clothing, or
        whatever. Taxes fully absorbed (&quot;capitalized&quot;) in a market
        price such as land taxes in no way distort behavior, the volume of transactions,
              or gross
              prices. They are neutral.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">A tax should also be efficient. To be sure, efficiency has many meanings
            even in economics. But here, rather than speaking of the administrative
            efficiency of its collection as will be addressed below, the measure is
            whether and how much it constitutes an excess burden on the economy, thereby
            slowing down performance and market vitality. Many taxes, as was mentioned
            earlier, exert so much drag on market transactions that they are destructive,
            however much revenue is brought to government coffers. Because land has
            a fixed supply there is no excess burden at all.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>People are frequently most concerned about
        the fairness of a tax, which is typically measured according to both
        horizontal and vertical equity.
              Horizontal equity means that those in similar circumstances will
        bear similar burdens. Vertical equity prescribes that those with greater
        resources will
              pay more. Although studies have yet to show this, land taxes are
        likely the most &quot;progressive&quot; of any levy, as tenants bear
        no passed-through burden at all.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[22]</em></strong></font> Not
              only does no household or office tenant bear any tax burden, locational
              sites distant from the urban core, mostly homeowners and farmers,
        typically find their burden reduced. Vacant or underused lots in high
        value areas
              pick up the difference, employing a design that employs an alternate
        criterion of equity: taxing according to use. &quot;Paying for what you take and
              not for what you make&quot; encourages efficient consumption of
              space and resources in an automatic and non-coercive manner. The
              one-third
              of households
              that own no land are relieved of all taxes, and residential and
              non-residential property owners split the rest. Farmers, whose
              land is typically
              of inconsequential value relative to sites in urban areas, are
              likely to pay little if anything
              even if they are not already protected by other save-harmless provisions.
              By eliminating taxes on building improvements they typically enjoy
              savings just as do other businesses.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>All this makes for a far simpler and more
        comprehensible system of taxation. Land taxes are totally transparent,
        impossible to evade, and therefore
              much more administrable. This further engenders the legitimacy
        of taxation and of government itself. What it also does is assure stability
        to the
              tax system, for the reason that land values are not subject to
        the
        variations and vacillations that other tax bases frequently have. Indeed,
        the removal
              of economic rent from locational sites discourages speculative
        bubbles and the related economic cycles that are associated with them.
        This
        greater stability and reliability is to the advantage of every sector
        of the economy &#8212; private,
              public, and non-profit.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">A tax that collects economic rent offers a
      win-win proposition to every sector of the community &#8212; except to
      those who speculate in land. But who wants to favor land speculators? They
      are not held in high regard
            anywhere; their destructive behavior is the bane of cities, recognized
            everywhere for what it is: parasitic and passive. Speculators provide
      no added value to a community's well-being, and taxing rent is a foolproof
            means by which to eliminate it. Land speculation is highest where
      the most
            rent can be privately captured, but it forces those who choose to
      develop to look to sub-optimal locations when the primary locations they
      hoped
            for are held off the market for opportunistic gain. By collecting
      rent, primary choice locations become available for use and to facilitate
      the
            development of land use configurations ideal for the economic health
      and efficient allocation. Urban ambience is improved, public sector service
            costs are reduced, and sprawl development is stemmed. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></div>

          transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a

          had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
          railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
          economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
          States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
          evaporating.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor
          Henry George marveled at the
          stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
          Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished want
          and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
          classes from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the
          division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
          had increased the dependence of the working poor upon forces
          beyond their control. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The working

          more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. It

          society, but through society. Those who are above the point of

GEO-RENT <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>While this article
will not necessarily serve as a manifesto for
the idea of tapping geo-rent to fund community goods, there are a

  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Geo-rent taxation would reduce sprawl</span>.
    </span>Current
tax policies tend to discourage the development of urban land, because
the fruits of those developments are directly taxed. To the extent that
those policies are replaced by policies that tap geo-rent, the
landowner is incented to develop his land. Recall, an underused site
pays the same geo-rent tax as a developed site. The untaxing of
production combined with the tapping of geo-rent will induce infilling
of the city center, making for a more compact city, agreeable to mixed
use and pedestrian activity. Hence, the demand-side push for sprawl is
diminished. Moreover, the supply-side pull toward sprawl would also be
diminished: Today, sprawl landowners are subsidized by extraneous
taxpayers who pay for the roads, sewers, schools, fire-fighting, and
security in the sprawl neighborhoods. If those services depended on the

<blockquote>
  <p>Somehow he did manage to live. By one means or another he got over the peak
      of his greatest distress, and four years later, in the winter of 1868,
    he came from California to New York on an errand for a newspaper. He was
    then not quite
      thirty years old, and did not even yet have a dollar in his pocket that
    he could call his own. New York showed him something brand-new in his experience.
      Up to this time he had not been in a position to see any great show of
    inequality
      in the distribution of wealth. Life was simple in the Philadelphia of his
    boyhood days, and in the rough and new California of his youth one person
    lived much
      like another. But now, in the New York of 1868, he saw our western Palmyra
      in all the shoddy glory of its post-war period, and by all accounts it
    must have been a most dreadful sight, as repulsive as the pens of Dickens
    and George
      William Curtis pictured it. Shoddy riches, shoddy show, shoddy ideals and
    taste, shoddy people &#8212; and on the other hand, whole populations of
    troglodyte slum-dwellers living at an almost inconceivable depth of wretchedness
    and degradation.</p>
  <p>Years afterward George said that here &#8220;I saw and recognized for the
      first time the shocking contrast between monstrous wealth and debasing want.&#8221; What
      was the cause of it? Again, nobody seemed to know. Like depressions and
      plagues, it was taken as part of the regular order of nature. It had always
      existed
      in large commercial and industrial centers, apparently it was bound always
      to exist, and it seemed to be just another one of the things that had to
      be put up with. There was no cure for it, so far as anybody knew. All that
      could
      be done was to take some of the curse off it by charity of one sort or
      another, and this was being done; in fact, it was beginning to be organized
      on a large
      scale, more lavishly perhaps than in any other country.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, George reasoned with himself, the thing had to have a cause,
      for nothing in nature ever happens without a cause. If that cause could be
      found, a cure might be found; but trying to deal with an effect without knowing
      anything about its cause would be mere fumbling in the dark. Here, then, was
      a second question, to which George pledged his lifetime for an answer. <strong>The
      first question was, what is the cause &#8212; not any superficial and apparent
      cause, but the true fundamental cause &#8212; of recurrent industrial depressions?
      The second question was, what is the true fundamental cause of the enormous
      inequality in the distribution of wealth?</strong></p>
  <p>George succeeded in answering these two questions to his own satisfaction
      while he was still a comparatively young man. This was the only success he
      ever had in his life; whatever else he touched failed. His one success, however,
      such as it was, led him through one of the strangest and most remarkable careers
      ever achieved in America, or for that matter, in the world. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general
      readjustment are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent

    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive

  <p><em>Q46. How can it be possible that speculative land values cause business
      depressions when, as any business man will tell you, the whole item of
      land value &#8212; whether ground rent or interest on purchase money &#8212; is
      one of the smallest items in every business?</em><br>
A. You overlook the fact that the item of speculative rent is the only item which
the business man does not get back again. The cost of his goods, the expense
of clerk hire, the rent of his building, the wear and tear of implements, are
all received back, in the course of normal business, in the prices of his goods.
Even his ground rent, to the extent that it is normal (i.e., what it would be
if the supply of land were determined alone by land in use, and not affected
by the land that is held out of use for higher values), comes back to him in
the sense that his aggregate profits are that much greater than they would be
where ground rent was less. But the extra ground rent which he is obliged to
pay, in consequence of the abnormal scarcity of land, is a dead weight; it does
not come back to him. Therefore, even if infinitesimal in amount, as compared
with the other expenses of his business &#8212; and that is by no means admitted &#8212; it
is the one expense which may break a thriving business down. Besides, it is not
alone the ground rent paid by the business man for his location that bears down
upon his business prosperity; the weight of abnormally high land values in general
presses upon business in general, and by obstructing the flow of trade forces
the weaker business units to the wall. It is not altogether safe to deduce general
economic principles from the ledgers of particular business houses.... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
wealth gap is increasing in the
US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the
population has $2 trillion more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the
suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
$582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the
land are Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A United Nations study of 83
countries showed that less than 5% of
rural landowners control three-quarters of the land. Other studies on
land ownership report these facts: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span>, 2% of
landowners hold 60% of the arable land while close to 70% of rural
households have little or none. Just 342 farm properties in Brazil
cover 183,397 square miles - an area larger than California. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Venezuela</span>, 77%
of the farmland is owned by 3% of the people. In Spain, 70 per cent of
the land is owned by 0.2 per cent of the people. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Britain</span>, 69
per cent
of the land is owned by 0.6 per cent of the population. Just 158,000
families own 41 million acres of land while 24 million families live on
four million acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[9]</span></small></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic human need for food
and shelter requires access of labor to
land. With access to land people can produce the basic requirements of
life. Access to land provides an enabling environment for life itself
and thus meets the minimum requirement of love, meaning fairness in
human relations based on the fundamental equal right to exist. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
Land Problem in its two forms - the inequitable ownership and control
of land and natural resources and the treatment of land as a market
commodity - is the root cause of the great amount of human deprivation
and suffering from lack of the basic necessities of life.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">And
yet the human right to the earth is missing from the Bill of Rights,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Human Rights.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Democratic governance has not yet concerned itself with a "first
principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span>
The question of "Who Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question.
In venues when this question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span></small>

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>High land price guides
investors to prefer kinds of capital that
substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
prices
are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
structure
and character of capital is determined by the level of rents and
wages.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19&nbsp;</span></small>
Such substitution is an integral part of the
equilibrating function of markets; the human race could never have
attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages
evoke labor-saving capital; high rents evoke land-saving capital.&nbsp;
It is useful to carry this farther, and recognize five kinds of
substitutive capital evoked by high rents and land prices:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-saving
capital, like high buildings.<br>
b.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-enhancing
capital, meaning capital used to improve land for new, higher
use.<br>
c.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-linking
capital, like canals and rails and city streets.<br>
d.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-capturing
(rent-seeking) capital, like squatters' improvements, and canal
and rail lines built to secure land grants,
and dams and canals built to secure water rights. <br>
e. Rent-leading capital.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To understand the forces shaping
capital investment, one must recognize
the difference of land and capital.&nbsp; High land prices evoke
substitution of capital for land, shaping the capital stock in
particular
ways.&nbsp; Viewed positively, this is a central part of economic
equilibration, tempering land scarcity.&nbsp; Viewed negatively, it has
led historically to boom and bust cycles.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">C. Land-driven Booms
and Busts</span></small><br>
<small>...</small><br>
<small>In a speculative land boom, land prices go prematurely
high.&nbsp;
Premature high land values profoundly distort the character of capital
investment.&nbsp; High land prices stimulate land-saving,
land-enhancing
and land-linking investments.&nbsp; This is a rational economic
response
when and if the market is sending the right signals.&nbsp; Ideally, an
optimally high level of land rents and values serves as a community
synchronizer, causing everyone to build <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">as though others were going to
build complementarily in synchronized fashion</span>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>However, in the frenzy of a speculative boom the market sends
the wrong
signals.&nbsp; Land is peculiarly subject to irrational speculative
pricing&nbsp;
in booms because of its subjective pricing - see <a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html#B-16">B-16</a>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Overpricing of land reserves land for two contrasting kinds of
buyers
and
holders.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Type
A buyer</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">s would "force
the future" with
"rent-leading" buildings.&nbsp;</span> They plan to and do develop
land for a future demand higher than present demand.&nbsp; In Chicago,
1835, this was exemplified by building four-story buildings outside The
Loop (the city center).&nbsp; Overpricing and consequent
over-improvement
gets greater, the further out you go.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When that demand fails to materialize, Type A buyers cannot
recover
their
money.&nbsp; They cannot rent out all their floor space, if that is
what
they built.&nbsp; Or they cannot use the full capacity of their
tannery,
harbor, shipyard, sawmill, packing plant, soap factory, brickyard, or
whatever they overbuilt.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When Type A buyers develop land beyond the reach of existing
infrastructure, they force extensions of same which are often losers,
cross-subsidized by the whole system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Type
B landowners</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> just hold
land unused or underused.</span>&nbsp; Rather than
force the future, they would free-ride on the future.&nbsp; They are
usually looking or expecting to sell for a rise.&nbsp; Type B-1 is the
aggressive outside buyer, the stereotypical "land speculator"
who does this calculatingly, cold-heartedly, as a purely pecuniary
investment.&nbsp; Type B-2 is the ancient owner whose land just happens
to lie in the way of growth.&nbsp; Type B-2 owners are sympathetic
figures in popular drama and sentiment.&nbsp; They are passive victims
of
change, clinging to old values against mechanistic, impersonal,
exogenous, amoral, modernizing forces.&nbsp; However, their market
behavior has much the same economic consequences as that of Type B-1.
Many turn out to be ambivalent, resisting change for a few years while
quietly expecting to sell out for the top dollar for their
retirement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The land of Type B landowners absorbs no capital directly, but
much
capital indirectly, by forcing the stretching-out of all land-linking
investments in space, and generating no traffic or use to justify those
that are built to and past them.&nbsp; Empty land also generates no
synergistic spillover gains to raise the cash flow of surrounding,
complementary lands.&nbsp; Thus it helps freeze capital sunk in
improving
them.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-property taxes, you know,
mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity. </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The adequacy of a tax base must
be judged over the cycle of
boom and bust, a cycle we are now learning is still much alive.
</b>How stable is the base? Capital comes and goes; land is fixed.
When they finally close that plant and move the work to Mexico, at
present we reward them by lowering their taxable valuation -- reward
them and punish ourselves, as city revenues fall. On the other hand,
if we taxed just their land, the valuation would remain about the
same. They will squeal, cajole, and threaten, but no way can they
move their land to Mexico. They will just have to find a new use for
it. Meantime, you will have made it more likely there are profitable
new uses by removing the tax threat against whatever new capital they
might invest in your town to employ your people.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Land prices boom and bust
too, jeopardizing revenue
stability. That can be a problem, but land taxation contains a
built-in contra-cyclical factor. <b>When a land boom reaches its
manic phase, as it did in California before 1989, growth expectations
rise so high that they offset interest costs: people think they are
holding land with no net carrying cost. </b>Your home is expected not
just to shelter you, but pay off its own mortgage, upkeep, and
maintenance by appreciating. Call it irrational, but it happens. In
this phase, the fast-moving tax assessor is an equilibrating force.
The quicker he follows such a market, the quicker he showers it with
cold water, by imposing a sobering cash drain on the participants.
This is an excellent time for local governments, if they have the
wit, to pay their debts, fix their potholes, and fill the fiscal
reservoir against the next drought. &nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those getting the cold shower,
meantime, may resist it. In
California, the land of extremes, we got Howard Jarvis and <b><a
 href="Prop13.html">Prop.
13</a>. This Constitutional Amendment capped the property tax rate at
1%,
and virtually froze assessed values until land sold. </b>Then the
boom really went wild. I myself, after campaigning hard against
Jarvis, unexpectedly made $200,000 in a few months after it passed.
Buyers were chasing me around the block, just to buy a scrap of land
I happened to have in the right place at the right time. It was blind
luck, but the money was as good as though I had earned it honestly:
better, in fact, because 60% of the gain was not even reportable as
taxable income. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but buyers
and sellers came to regard it as normal, and only fair. They saw
regular annual increments as a divine right of property. For a few
mad years, they were.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>It was the lack of a tax
stabilizer that took the cap off
land prices. When my lot rose to $240,000, it was still assessed at
$10,000, and capped there by constitutional law! Taxes were 1% of
$10,000 - that's right, $100/year, 1/24 of 1% of the market value.
Was I in a strong bargaining position? You bet, and I loved it, just
as you might. Now we are paying the price, or beginning to, as our
public services collapse and our criminals outgun our police. This
year they are cutting faculty salaries (that's me) 5%, and raising
college tuition (that's my three children) 100%.</b> I'll pay all
right. All tax rates other than property are headed north; land
prices south. Our once-vibrant economy is dying; our unemployment
rate leads the nation. Our largest city was torched last year by the
frustrated unemployed. Our once-leading schools trail the nation; our
murder rate leads it. Those are the economic consequences of Howard
Jarvis. Like Tokyo and London and Faust, we signed with
Mephistopheles. He showed us a grand time, but now his bill is due.
To paraphrase Kipling, "Be warned of our lot, which I dread you may
not, and learn about Jarvis from me."&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

and Control of Monopolies</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recessions (and depressions) may
occur when there are massive shocks to
the system (e.g., the OPEC producers withholding supplies and doubling
and tripling prices of a commodity that could not be readily
substituted for). Recessions may also be prolonged and accelerated by
unwise public policy choices made by people who have no idea of the
consequences of their actions or inactions. Now, in the activist area
where I am working, there is still a strong cry for a Constitutional
amendment to balance the U.S. Federal budget. Some of the economists in
and out of government are saying this would be a disaster, using the
same sort of "if GDP is growing, don't worry be happy" pronouncement
you refer to above. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When GDP is

<br>
<small>As for the coming "boom," I simply repeat my observation that
there is
no U.S. economy; there are only regional economies competing with one
another as well as with other nations. We have the beginnings of
speculative booms in some places, stability in others, and continuing
recessions in others. People who cannot sell their houses because they
owe more on them than they are worth cannot take their services
elsewhere to seek employment. So much for the mobility of the labour
force. This is one of the unfortunate sides of the American dream of
home ownership; when a lease expires, one simply does not renew.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Only around 25-30% of households own their own homes. By good
fortune,
I just read something that helps resolve the difficulty. It seems that
a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive Era had
been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas A.
Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure
inventor. Much of this legislation became unravelled under President -
guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and
political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and
monopolization then ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has
played a role in this. Disney as real estate developer throws its heavy
weight around brutally. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<small>For all their dismal policy failures, economists always seem to
present
themselves as having learnt from the past mistakes of others and to
have caught on to the right policy mix. And yet they, too, are
invariably criticised by the succeeding generation of economists who
themselves trumpet the reasons why they have now got it right. And
nothing exemplifies this ongoing farce more than the debates
surrounding the economic boom and bust cycles - or, more particularly,
the reasons for economic recessions. We can confidently predict that
conventional neoclassical economists will never find the solution in
their own gloomy cupboards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We know already how the failure to distinguish land from capital
fatally flaws neoclassical economics at its very core. This confusion
has been taken a step further by the real estate business in a way
that, when you see it for what it is, verges on the absurd.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WORDS THAT OBSCURE</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real estate
terminology
obscures the whole land issue by hardly ever separating land from
buildings, but lumping the two together as "property."</span>&nbsp; So
when
land prices start rising, the real estate sector terms this a property
boom or housing boom, concealing the fact that houses (or capital)
cannot but depreciate over time while land always appreciates. They
speak of the "housing market" as if houses levitated all over the
place. In point of fact, housing construction costs - both labour and
material combined - have declined in real terms in Australia over the
thirty five years to 1985 by 1%, while over the same period, land price
has skyrocketed by a very healthy average of around 6% per annum!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, the media have
convinced
the public that a "healthy property market" is a good thing and - hey!
- if you're a speculator, then you begin rubbing your hands with glee
as you estimate your latest windfall. </span>If you are a home-owner
however, your "new" net worth is of little benefit if you intend
selling up and moving, since the price of the home which you intend to
buy will in most cases have risen by a similar margin, so where is the
gain?. Well, we've got news for you. It is rising land prices that
precede and are the primary cause nearly all economic recessions.
First, these recurrent booms starve the economy as funds are poured
into land instead of productive capital, and second, they choke any
immediate chance of recovery as businesses have to pay more and more
for land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now we get back to the peculiar nature of land. In a growing
economy,
land prices must rise because competition for land sites cannot be
satisfied by producing more sites. While the real estate industry is
merrily singing about the vigor of the property market, the cost of
space begins to outpace profit margins, and the economy is headed for a
recession.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"RUSH FOR THE EXIT!"</span></small><br>
<small>But we never spot the looming recession before it's too late,
because
once people observe a rise in land values, they too want to get in on
the act, thus pushing up land prices even further. And away we go on
this boom that isn't a boom at all, only a speculative bubble!</small><br>
<br>
<small>We do get a few warnings, but our learned friends in the real
estate
sector dress them up as indicators of rosy investment opportunities. As
the real estate market continues to "strengthen", the cost of occupancy
forces companies either to pay up even more or move elsewhere. And the
suffering soon spreads, because unrealistic land prices must take a cut
from the returns to labour and capital. As a result there is less
purchasing power to buy the goods and services of others, general
production is checked, and the whole downward spiral towards recession
has begun.</small><br>
<br>
<small>At a certain point in the land boom, buyers realise that the
yields on
their investments are not keeping pace with exorbitant land values, and
demand for land drops, in turn causing prices to level off. This is the
moment of collective d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Suddenly the speculators
realise, "Uh,
oh! I think I've been here before!", and begin panic selling as they
realise that their investments could earn more elsewhere. The turning
tide becomes a flash flood, as speculators recognise that the only way
out is to sell quickly before prospective buyers realise that the
bottom has dropped out of the market. At the same time some start to
default on loans which they had taken out to make their now-overvalued
speculative purchases, and at this point the banking sector is involved
in the domino effect. The banks have over-extended themselves on the
speculative land bubble, and when they must start to recall their
loans, the knock-on consequences can be even more severe.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU KNOW THE REST&#8230;</span></small><br>
<small>The rest is history, literally. Speculation in land (or in the
shares
of companies owning natural resources) can be isolated as the prime
factor for practically every periodic panic that has caused economic
crises. Of course, there are all sorts of contributing factors or even
effects that governments, real estate professionals and neoclassical
economists will claim to be the major cause of recessions. In the 19th
century, governments often used the printing presses to increase the
money supply in desperate attempts to stave off the inevitable crises.
The restrictive trade policies of the Great Depression were not really
a cause but rather an outcome, which in turn exacerbated things. But
the great initiatory cause is invariably the speculative advance in
land price, but it's difficult to spot because it does its dirty work
while everyone is crying, "Boom, boom! Robust land market!"</small><br>
<br>
<small>Broadly speaking, the recession will continue until one or more
of three things occur:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Land values fall to affordable levels again</small></li>
  <li><small>The efficiency of labour and technology increases</small></li>
  <li><small>Labour and capital are forced to accept cuts in wages and
interest.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A boom can never be genuine
under land monopoly capitalism, for
speculators inevitably bid up the price of scarce land. And when money
is diverted to speculative purposes, it is effectively sterilised, for
buying land does not create wealth (machines or jobs).&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
automobile.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Noticing rent, realizing its
social nature, accepting that it's to
be shared, and understanding that wages and interest should not be
expropriated, for most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking
such thoughts leads to a new way of conceiving economics, too.
Ecological economics becomes not just a branch of economics but a
whole new discipline, needing a new name. In geonomics we maintain
the distinction between items bearing exchange value that come into
being by human effort - wealth - and those that don't - land. Keeping
this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious and
non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that
hoarding land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy
land plus buildings engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is
quasi-rent, that the cost of land inflates faster than the price of
produced goods and services, that over half of corporate profit, says
the Urban Land Institute, is from real estate. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Summing up these analyses, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomists offer a Grand Unifying
Theory, that the flow of rent pulls all other indicators in its wake.
</span>Geonomics differs from economics as chemistry from alchemy, as
astronomy from astrology. The acid test of any science is prediction,
a test that economics fails and geonomics passes. Plugging in the
land price cycle of 17+ years lets geonomists crank out predictions
more accurate than those generated by "the experts" who missed, for
example, the collapse of mighty Japan. When the land of the Rising
Sun was on the market for four times the assessed value of all
America, that's when a few geonomists, like voices in the wilderness,
countered conventional wisdom by proclaiming that the Japanese boom
would bust. According to these geonomic prognosticators, don't expect
America's next downturn for at least another five years, despite the
tech wreck or any other stock market fluctuations. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Geonomics draws its power to
predict and fix what ails economies
by being grounded in reality. It holds to the notion that economies
are not apart from but part of the embracing eco-system. As part of
whole, economies self-regulate by the same natural feedback loops.
The prey/predator cycle is mimicked by the pricing cycle, also known
as the <b>Law of Supply and Demand</b>. This familiar pattern is
found, too, in the <b>Share Rent Cycle</b>.</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>(1)&nbsp; Getting more rent, people work less, so
output drops. <br>
(2)&nbsp; Less output lowers land values and deflates the rent-share. <br>
(3)&nbsp; Getting less rent, people work more. <br>
(4) More output raises site values and swells the rent-share. <br>
(1) Again, ad infinitum. </small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, production is put into
balance with consumption and work
with play. Geonomics yields a policy that's not at war with but
aligned with nature as model. Perhaps the most central feature of
economics is price. Price is to production what DNA is to
reproduction, the guides to growth. Rather than distort price with
taxes and subsidies, with license (so-called "externalities") and
rent-retention, geonomics respects the integrity of price, allowing
it to accurately reflect our costs and values, by sharing rent. Then
economies ("geonomies") can operate without the deadweight losses of
taxation and rent seeking. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To sustain that which we love,
we must transform our relationships
to nature, to government, and to each other. We need to become
geonomists in worldview, theory, discipline, and policy. Geonomics
creates an economy that's not at war with but aligned with the
natural world.</small><small>...&nbsp; <a

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which every
    human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was fixed in supply,
    the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to enjoy exclusive
    rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer majority from
    land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners in order to access
    this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of rents by landowners
    allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing to the productive
    efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did the demand for land,
    forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition, increases in land
    value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such as roads and public
    transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the expense of the community.
    Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged speculation in land, pushing
    prices even higher, while exposing the economy to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;.
    ...</p>
  <p>Georgists have also frequently claimed to be able to explain and ameliorate,
    even resolve, the cyclical character of the capitalist economy. George argued
    that a higher uniform land tax could reduce the severity of booms and busts
    in the housing market by reducing the speculative investment in land. This
    would produce more stable economic conditions throughout the economy, removing
    the boom-bust cycle to which capitalism is otherwise prone. It is an argument
    that has contemporary Australian relevance because the boom-bust character
    of the urban property market is clearly a significant factor in overall cyclical
    economic instability. An earlier article on Australian land price trends
    by Kavanagh (2001) has illustrated this connection, demonstrating that, while
    the property market is more volatile than the economy as a whole, there has
    been a clear temporal connection between the two patterns of cyclical behaviour
    over the last half century. Property booms and busts have typically coincided
    with swings in overall national economic performance. The policy implication
    is that, by smoothing out cycles in the housing market, a uniform land tax
    could help to avoid periodic crises in capitalist economies more generally.</p>
  <p>However, the argument needs to be kept in perspective. Periodic economic
    recessions cannot be solely attributed to speculation in land.</p>
  <p>Inadequate levels of aggregate demand, problems of overproduction, and problems
    of instability in financial markets are among other causes of interruptions
    to the process of capital accumulation. Land tax cannot feasibly claim to
    redress all the systemic contradictions and malfunctions of a capitalist
    economy. Additional counter-cyclical policies are necessary. These include
    macroeconomic stabilisers, such as monetary and fiscal policies, that can
    contribute to reducing the cyclical tendency to which the economy is otherwise
    prone, along with incomes policy and the more radically interventionist &#8216;socialisation
    of investment&#8217; that Keynes (1936: 378) advocated. So here, too, land
    tax seems to have the status of a necessary but not sufficient condition
    for progressive economic reform. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Stability</b> refers to the
ability of a tax to produce revenue
in the face of changing economic circumstances. Income and sales
taxes, for example, vary greatly according to phases in the economic
cycle; the property tax, in contrast, is highly stable regardless of
the state of the economy. Followers of economist John Maynard Keynes
believe that revenues should be inverse to the cycles of the economy;
i.e., that the government should be used to stabilize or boost the
economy as occasions require. I should add as an aside that t<b>here
are some theorists who believe that, were revenue sources completely
based on land value, economic cycles would disappear.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In assessing the value of a tax it
is also important, of course,
to understand its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of
government. This is usually deemed revenue sufficiency. Income, sales
and property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent,
have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. In contrast, if you take the time to
look at a tax on land value alone, it measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being

witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced.</span> He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington

<br>
Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, George differentiated
sharply between land itself and
the products -- or wealth, as he termed them -- which labor made from
the land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural
forces, but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter,
and, to produce wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter
and to these forces -- that is to say, to land. The land is the
source of all wealth. It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore
that labor fashions. It is the substance to which labor gives the
form."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> George saw, as between land and
products, certain elementary
differences. "In every essential, land differs from those things
which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the
creation of God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity;
they may be increased illimitably. It exists, though generations come
and go; they in a little while decay and pass again into the
elements." </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having noted these differences,
George proceeded to use them as
the basis for his examination of related areas of economics, such as
speculation. When asked how speculation worked, George responded that
a distinction must be made between speculation in land and
speculation in products. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Writing of industrial depressions,
he said, "When, with the desire
to consume more, there coexist the ability and willingness to produce
more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot be charged either to
overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly, the trouble is that
production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy each other . </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"How does this inability arise? It
is evidently and by common
consent the result of speculation. But of speculation in what? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Certainly not of speculation in
things which are the products of
labor ...for the effect of speculation in such things, as is well
shown in current treatises that spare me the necessity of
illustration, is simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady
the interplay of production and consumption by an action analogous to
that of a fly-wheel in a machine."&nbsp; In other
words, the tendency of speculation in products is to increase the
demand for products and therefore to increase the price of products.
This increased price will induce more production, which, increasing
the supply, will tend to lower the price. Throughout this cycle,
there has been a stimulating effect on production in general. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He continued, "Therefore, if
speculation be the cause of these
industrial depressions, it must be speculation in things not the
production of labor, but yet necessary to the exertion of labor in
the production of wealth -- of things of fixed quantity; that is to
say, it must be speculation in land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How can this be? How can
speculation in land cause industrial
depression? George explains, "...that there is a connection between
the rapid construction of railroads and industrial depression, anyone
who understands what increased land values mean, and who has noticed
the effect which the construction of railroads has upon land
speculation, can easily see. Wherever a railroad was built or
projected, lands sprang up in value under the influence of
speculation, and thousands of millions of dollars were added to the
nominal values which capital and labor were asked to pay outright, or
to pay in installments, as the price of being allowed to go to work
and produce wealth. The inevitable result was to check production.
.."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tendency of speculation in
land is similar to that of
speculation in products; it increases the demand for land and thereby
increases the price of land. However, here the similarity ends. The
supply of land is fixed; as successive units of land become priced
beyond the level at which labor and capital can profitably engage in
production, an increasing (though artificial) scarcity of land
develops. "The inevitable result was to check production."&nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, according to George, another
difference between land and
products is that speculation in products tends to stimulate
production, whereas speculation in land tends to check production.&nbsp;

  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed. ...</p>
  <p>The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
      themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
      they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
      states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
      are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
      claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
      what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
      and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
      In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
      they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
  <p>Instead of addressing ourselves seriously to the task of establishing social
      justice &#8212; the most momentous task which has ever confronted this country
      in all its history &#8212; we have wasted our energies and resources in
      adopting shallow and superficial measures not in harmony with the realities
      of social
      life and which ignore its natural laws; erecting great bureaucracies which
      have attempted to regiment our people, while the mass of regulations which
      they have prescribed have served only to demoralize industry, prevent its
      recovery and obstruct the cooperation between labor, capital and consumer
      which the
      interests of all require. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the
