<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But I have not time to enter
into further details. I can only ask
you to think upon this thing, and the more you will see its
desirability. As an English friend of mine puts it: <span

land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to
take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of
the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might,
without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure
from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met
with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not
work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting
the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug.
The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does
harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every
citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade. Charity schools do
degrade children that are sent to them, but public schools do not. ... <a

Alanna Hartzok: <a
 href="../docs/Hartzok_citdivs_oil.html">CITIZEN
DIVIDENDS AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of
Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway&sup1;s citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The paper recommends full use
of information and communication
technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
(ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
possible distribution of citizen dividends.<br>

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small> ...<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ...</strong><br>

<small>What would you do if
you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully </span>is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history
ended&#8221;.
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs&#8221;, a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Meanwhile, ignoring our common assets guarantees that we
continue to
pay rent rather than begin to receive rent. Conversely, insisting upon
a fair share could <span style="font-weight: bold;">win us the world
we want</span>. While it breaks an old habit to leave jobs behind in
favour of fair distribution, just recognizing surplus empowers people.
It reaffirms the very existence of our commonwealth and challenges the
narrow view of property as exclusively private. While the Left gets
excoriated for wanting to be big spenders, demanding a dividend in lieu
of waste and a shift of taxes from individual effort to social surplus
helps refurbish the Left&#8217;s image.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The call to share the commonwealth enjoys an unshakable moral
base and
gets high marks for real world success, unlike taxes upon true
earnings. Once implemented, sharing rent will grant us leisure &#8211; time
enough to evolve and reconnect with friends, family, and neighbours &#8211;
and drain away fortunes rather than let the fortunate continue to soak
society. Hence support for shifting taxes and paying dividends to the
citizenry grows already, without the Left&#8217;s leadership. It&#8217;s time to
run with the banner of an extra income for everyone, in the halls and
capitols of governments everywhere. To liberate humans from exploitive
labor, let us advance the sharing of society&#8217;s surplus.</small><br>

<p>Louis Post: <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?</em></p>
  <p>A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
        of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
        potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
        not is as yet an unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised
        from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while
        any land value remains in private possession. Until land values are exhausted
        the taxation of labor cannot be excused.</p>
  <p><em>Q4. What disposition would you make of the revenues that exceeded the needs
    of government?</em></p>
  <p>A. The people who ask this question ought to settle it with those who want
      to know whether the single tax would yield revenue enough. I do not believe
      that public revenues under the single tax would exceed the just needs of
      economical government; in better highways, better sidewalks, better wharves,
      better schools, better public service of various kinds, we should find sufficient
      demand for all our revenues. But the question of deficiency or surplus is
      one to be met and disposed of when it arises. The present question is the
      wisdom and the justice of applying land values to common use, as far as they
      will go or as much of them as may be needed as the case may prove to be.

    Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Fear of a funded
government</b>
</small><br>
<small>There is also a well founded libertarian concern that land rent
could provide funds enough to support a corrupt and oppressive
government. Most libertarian supporters of the governmental
collection of land rent therefore fall into two camps. One would give
the people power to limit how much money the government can take, but
would stipulate that all such money come entirely from ground rents
and natural resource severance royalties. The other would take the
full rent, but would stipulate that the government can still only
spend what the citizens authorize it to spend. The rest would be
distributed on a per-capita basis. ... <a

<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., <a href="../docs/King_Where.htm">Where Do
    We Go From Here?</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be
    made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position
    we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted.
    New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for
    those for whom traditional jobs are not available. In 1879 Henry George anticipated
    this state of affairs when he wrote in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind, the work
        which extends knowledge and increases power and enriches literature and elevates
        thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work of slaves driven
        to their tasks either by the task, by the taskmaster, or by animal necessity.
        It is the work of men who somehow find a form of work that brings a security
        for its own sake and a state of society where want is abolished. [Book IX:
        Effects of the Remedy; Chapter 4: Of the changes that would be wrought in
        social organization and social life]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  Work of this sort could be enormously increased, and we are likely to find
      that the problems of housing and education, instead of preceding the elimination
      of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The
      poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter
      housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect
      on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in
      their struggle.</p>
  <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
    will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
    will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
    when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands,
    wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
    on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
  <p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
    annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And I
    say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
    a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
    to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
    on their own two feet right here on earth. ... <a href="../docs/King_Where.htm">read the whole chapter and speech</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>Georgists today are
also frequently very divided on the role of
government in society. Many are vehemently anti-government and are
subscribers to libertarian views;</big><span

others are rather conventional progressives in their belief and
confidence in the role of government to provide the full array of
public services which are typically found in modern democratic
societies. The axis of Georgist thought cuts completely across
conventional political party lines as a consequence: one finds hardline
conservatives and progressive &#8220;liberals&#8221; united only in the view that
economic land rent should not be left in the hands of titleholders.
Most would use such revenues to finance the support of government
services, abolishing completely the wide array of income, sales,
corporate franchise and other taxes that are currently used, keeping
only environmental fees and user fees.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Adherents of minimalist government believe that any extra rent
revenue
collected from holders of land should be returned to people
individually in the form of a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s dividend.&#8221; Given the choice of
using the full amount of surplus rent to support government services or
collecting only a portion, many libertarian Georgists would collect it
all; leaving it otherwise in the hands of property holders, they
believe, has more negative consequences than not collecting it. Not
collecting the economic rent, so they argue, is worse than throwing it
&#8220;into the sea&#8221; for all its distorting and destructive consequences.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Others advocates would prefer to
collect it not for financing the
services of government but rather to distribute it as a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s
dividend.&#8221;</span> There is widespread recognition of the destructive
consequences of the failure to collect land rent. Some Georgists would
allow a token amount of rent to be retained by landholders so as to
facilitate real estate markets above and beyond what might otherwise be
realized. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Surpluses</b></p>
  <p>Another difference is that Canadians are much more restrained and self-controlled
    than Americans, and therefore they've managed to build up enormous surpluses.
    There's something called the <b>Alberta Heritage Fund</b>, where instead of
    just blowing that money as it came in, they squirreled it away and saved it
    up and it's now considered I believe the largest single block of available
    capital in North America: $6-10 billion (I lost sight of the figures somewhere
    as they were going up). But can imagine Howard Jarvis in Alberta with his beady
    eyes on the Alberta Heritage Fund? Why, when we built up a surplus of just
    a few million dollars in Sacramento Howard Jarvis climbed all over everybody,
    'We've got to cut taxes.' And that's when we got 'Proposition 13'. Saskatchewan

      even if he's an economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource

      in Canadian politics means sharing the economic rent.</b> Everybody talks

      way. Just as though rent were a permissible word in polite discourse. It's
      very refreshing. <span

 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair game.</i></b> As a
      matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print of the equalization law,
      which I did on the airplane, you find the most interesting exception to what's
      included in the formula. I'll explain the formula to you in a moment if you
      are still awake.</p>
  <p>The formula says that the greater the capacity to raise taxes that a province
    enjoys, the less will be its equalization payment. And various potential tax
    bases are included in this formula. And one of those is the property tax. But
    then you look at the fine print and only the improvements are included.<b><i> The
    land is specifically excluded.</i></b> Very pecular. In the formula as it's
    commonly printed you don't see that exclusion; it's only in the footnote. But
    in the footnote it says 'Instead of the value of land we will substitute the
    gross provincial product.' Of course, all right thinking people know that land
    value is in direct proportion to the growth of the provincial product. Or do
    they? I always thought that was the product of other inputs. <b><i>What it
    means is that if a province has a great deal of valuable land which is not
    being used to a highest and best use, that valuable land will not be included
    in its potential tax base, and it can continue to get subventions from the
    federal government.</i></b> Whereas on the other hand if its potential tax
    base includes oil and gas, then the revenues that it receives from that, or
    the ability it has to receive revenues from that, is counted against it in
    the sharing formula. So this is a very peculiar sort of rent sharing. Some
    rents are shared and others are not. You might even call it a conspiracy against
    Alberta. I'm sure that's the way they look at it. ... <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This earth is a little raft moving in the endless sea of space, and the
    mass of its human inhabitants are hanging on as best they can. It is as if
    some
      raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be floating on the ocean, and
    a few of the strongest and most powerful would take all the raft they could
    get
      and leave the most of the people, especially the ones who did the work,
    hanging to the edges by their eyebrows. These men who have taken possession
    of this
      raft, this little planet in this endless space, are not even content with
    taking all there is and leaving the rest barely enough to hold onto, but
    they think
      so much of themselves and their brief day that while they live they must
    make rules and laws and regulations that parcel out the earth for thousands
    of years
      after they are dead and, gone, so that their descendants and others of
    their kind may do in the tenth generation exactly what they are doing today &#8212; keeping
      the earth and all the good things of the earth and compelling the great
    mass of mankind to toil for them.</p>
  <p>Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back? Everybody who thinks
      knows that private ownership of the land is wrong. If ten thousand men
    can own America, then one man can own it, and if one man may own it he may
    take
      all that the rest produce or he may kill them if he sees fit. It is inconsistent
      with the spirit of manhood. No person who thinks can doubt but that he
    was born upon this planet with the same birthright that came to every man
    born
      like him. And it is for him to defend that birthright. And the man who
    will not defend it, whatever the cost, is fitted only to be a slave. The
    earth belongs
      to the people &#8212; if they can get it &#8212; because if you cannot
      get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not, and
      if you
      can get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not,
      you just take it. The earth has been taken from the many by the few. It
      made no
      difference that they had no right to it; they took it.</p>
  <p>Now, there are some methods of getting access to the earth which are easier
      than others. The easiest, perhaps, that has been contrived is by means of taxation
      of the land values and land values alone; and I need only say a little upon
      that question. One trouble with it which makes it almost impossible to achieve,
      is that it is so simple and so easy. You cannot get people to do anything that
      is simple; they want it complex so they can be fooled.</p>
  <p>Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really believe in the common
      ownership of land is that the public should take not alone taxation from
    the land, but the public should take to itself the whole value of the land
    that
      has been created by the public &#8212; should take it all. It should be
      a part of the public wealth, should be used for public improvements, <strong>for pensions</strong>,
      and belong to the people who create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine
      in these strange times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by
      taxation. All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
      and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is so simple,
      and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if it is simple &#8212; that
      it is the easiest substantial reform for men to accomplish, and when it
      is done this great problem of poverty, the problem of the ages, will be
      almost
      solved. We may need go farther. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read

<blockquote>
  <p>One observer of this transformation was Thomas Paine, America&#8217;s pro-independence
    pamphleteer. Seeing how enclosure of the commons benefited a few and disinherited
    many others, Paine proposed a remedy &#8212; not a reversal of enclosure,
    which he considered necessary for economic reasons, but compensation for
    it.</p>
  <p>Like Locke, Paine believed nature was a gift of God to all. &#8220;There
    are two kinds of property,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Firstly, natural property,
    or that which comes to us from the Creator of the universe &#8212; such as
    the earth, air, water. Secondly, artificial or acquired property &#8212; the
    invention of men.&#8221; In the latter, he went on, equality is impossible,
    but in the former, &#8220;all individuals have legitimate birthrights.&#8221; Since
    such birthrights were diminished by enclosure, there ought to be an &#8220;indemnification
    for that loss.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Paine therefore proposed a &#8220;national fund&#8221; that would do two
    things:</p>
  <p>[Pay] to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the
    sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of
    his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed
    property: And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every
    person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall
    arrive at that age.</p>
  <p>A century and a half later, America created a national fund to do part of
    what Paine recommended &#8212; we call it Social Security. We&#8217;ve yet
    to adopt the other part, but its basic principle &#8212; that enclosure of
    a commons requires compensation &#8212; is as sound in our time as it was
    in Paine&#8217;s. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></p>
  <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
        one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded
        on the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural
        assets, it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and
    income rights. It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons
    equally, but everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from
    selling
        limited usage rights.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
      Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
        of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent Fund shows,
        it&#8217;s
        possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</p>
  <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on
        liquidity, but also on attention. People would notice common property if
        they got income from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it,
        and talk about it. Concern for invisible commons would soar.</p>
  <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since
        common property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable
        the way corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t
        reap capital gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income
        stakes throughout their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent,

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Let us suppose,&#8221; economist Ronald Coase wrote in 1960, &#8220;that
    a farmer and a cattle-raiser are operating on neighboring properties.&#8221; He
    went on to suppose further that the cattle-raiser&#8217;s animals wander
    onto the farmer&#8217;s land and damage his crops. From this hypothetical
    starting point Coase examined the problem of externalities and proposed a
    solution &#8212; the creation of rights to pollute or not be polluted upon.
    Today, pollution rights are used throughout the world. In effect, Coase conjured
    into existence a class of property rights that didn&#8217;t exist before,
    and his leap of imagination eventually reduced real pollution.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let us suppose&#8221; is a wonderful way for anyone, economists included,
    to begin thinking. It lets us adjust old assumptions and see what might happen.
    And it lets us imagine things that don&#8217;t exist but could, and sometimes,
    because we imagined them, later do.</p>
  <p>Coase supposed that a single polluter or his neighboring pollutee possessed
    a right to pollute or not be polluted upon. He further supposed that the
    transaction costs involved in negotiations between the two neighbors were
    negligible. He made these suppositions half a century ago, at a time when
    aggregate pollution wasn&#8217;t planet-threatening, as it now is. Given
    today&#8217;s altered reality, it might be worth updating Coase&#8217;s suppositions
    to make them relevant to this aggregate problem. Here, in my mind, are the
    appropriate new suppositions:</p>
  <p> * Instead of one polluter, there are many, and instead of one pollutee,
    there are millions &#8212; including many not yet born.<br>
  * The pollutees (including future generations) are collectively represented
  by trusts.<br>
  * The initial pollution rights are assigned by government to these trusts.<br>
  * In deciding how many pollution permits to sell, the trustees&#8217; duty
  isn&#8217;t to maximize revenue but to preserve an ecosystem for future generations.
  The trusts therefore establish safe levels of pollution and gradually reduce
  the number of permits they sell until those levels are reached.<br>
  * Revenue from the sale of pollution permits is divided 50 percent for per
  capita dividends (like the Alaska Permanent Fund) and 50 percent for public
  goods such as education and ecological restoration.</p>
  <p>If we make these suppositions, what then happens? We have, first of all,
    an economic model with a second set of books. Not all, but many externalities
    show up on these new ledgers. More importantly, we begin to imagine a world
    in which nature and future generations are represented in real-time transactions,
    corporations internalize previously externalized costs, prices of illth-causing
    goods rise, and everyone receives some property income.</p>
  <p>Here&#8217;s what such a world could look like:</p>
  <p> * Degradation of key ecosystems is gradually reduced to sustainable levels
    because the trustees who set commons usage levels are accountable to future
    generations, not living shareholders or voters. When they fail to protect
    their beneficiaries, they are sued.<br>
  * Thanks to per capita dividends, income is recycled from overusers of key
  ecosystems to underusers, creating both incentives to conserve and greater
  equity.<br>
  * Clean energy and organic farming are competitive because prices of fossil
  fuels and agricultural chemicals are appropriately high.<br>
  * Investment in new technologies soars and new domestic jobs are created because
  higher fuel and waste disposal prices boost demand for clean energy and waste
  recycling systems.<br>
  * Public goods are enhanced by permit revenue.</p>
  <p>What has happened here? We&#8217;ve gone from a realistic set of assumptions
    about how the world is &#8212; multiple polluters and pollutees, zero cost
    of pollution, dangerous cumulative levels of pollution &#8212; to a reasonable
    set of expectations about how the world could be if certain kinds of property
    rights are introduced. These property rights go beyond Coase&#8217;s, but
    are entirely compatible with market principles. The results of this thought
    experiment show that the introduction of common property trusts can produce
    a significant and long-lasting shift in economic outcomes without further
    government intervention.</p>
  <p>Commons Rent</p>
  <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be, a money-free
    zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and the rest of us) to
    understand is commons rent.</p>
  <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord. In
    economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid because
    of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound puzzling, but
    consider this. A city has available a million apartments. In absolute terms,
    that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But the city is confined geographically
    and demand for apartments is intense. In this economic sense, apartments
    are scarce. Now think back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage
    you pay the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
    or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
    is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San Franciscans
    write such large checks to landlords and banks, while people in Nebraska
    don&#8217;t.</p>
  <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply. Rent
    due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can (and should)
    debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself arises automatically.
    And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because this helps the larger economy
    allocate scarce resources efficiently. Other methods of allocation are possible.
    We can distribute scarce things on a first come, first served basis, or by
    lottery, political power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though,
    that selling scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach,
    and such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
  <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam Smith, David
    Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because it constituted
    most of the money earned by landowners, and land was then a major cost of
    production. The supply of land, these economists noted, is limited, but demand
    for it steadily increases. So, therefore, does its rent. Thus, landowners
    benefit from what Mill called the unearned increment &#8212; the rise in
    land value attributable not to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially
    created increase in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
  <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further. Seeing
    both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked a logical question:
    Why does poverty persist despite economic growth? The answer, he believed,
    was the appropriation of rent by landowners. Even as the economy grew, the
    property rights system and the scarcity of land diverted almost all the gains
    to a landowning minority. Whereas competition limited the gains of working
    people, nothing kept down the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted,
    the value of their land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated
    a steep tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
    Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
    economists never took him seriously.</p>
  <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in rent;
    it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to capital and labor.
    But the twenty-first century ecological crisis brings rent back to center-stage.
    Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s scarce, but clean water, undisturbed
    habitat, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
  <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and allocation
    of property rights are the primary factors in determining who pays whom for
    what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution rights are given free
    to past polluters, the rent from the polluted ecosystem will also go to them.
    That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden products will rise as pollution
    is limited (remember, if demand is constant, a reduction in supply causes
    prices to go up), and those higher prices will flow to producers (which is
    to say, polluters).</p>
  <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
    and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
    the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If the
    trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures on
    public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
  <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting corporations
    are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts getting the
    rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers will pay commons
    rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves as beneficiaries
    of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will be the same, but his
    payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden products. The more
    he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back
    less than they put in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic
    incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
    incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s interest
    to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent for scarce things
    works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re
    a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake of argument) your
    responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations, you want to
    increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits you sell,
    or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you lower the number
    of permits.</p>
  <p>This macroeconomic phenomenon &#8212; that less pollution yields more income
    for citizens &#8212; is the ultimate knockout punch for commons trusts. It
    aligns the interests of future generations with, rather than against, those
    of living citizens. By so doing, it lets us chart a transition to sustainability
    in which the political pressure is for faster pollution reduction rather
    than slower.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s one further argument for recycling commons rent through trusts.
    As rent is recycled from overusers of the commons to underusers, income is
    shifted from rich to poor. That&#8217;s because rich households, on average,
    use the commons more than poor households. They drive SUVs, fly in jets,
    and have large homes to heat and cool &#8212; thus they dump more waste into
    the biosphere. Studies by Congress and independent economists have shown
    that only a rent recycling system like the one just described can protect
    the poor. Absent such a system, the poor will pay commons rent and get nothing
    back. In other words, they&#8217;ll get poorer.</p>
  <p>As always, there are a few caveats.</p>
  <p> * First, to the extent commons rent is used for public goods rather than
    per capita dividends, the income recycling effects are diminished. This is
    offset, however, by the fact that public goods benefit everyone.<br>
  * Second, the less-pollution-equals-more-dividends formula doesn&#8217;t work
  indefinitely. At some point after less polluting technologies have been widely
  deployed, the demand for pollution absorption will become elastic. Then, lowering
  the number of pollution permits sold will decrease income to citizens. But
  that time is far in the future, and when it comes, the world will be a healthier
  place. And even then, trustees won&#8217;t be able to increase the number of
  pollution permits without violating their responsibility to future generations.</p>
  <p>The Effect on Poverty</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m now ready to make a bold assertion: sharing commons rent through
    per capita dividends isn&#8217;t just the best way to bring our economy into
    harmony with nature, it&#8217;s also the best way to reduce poverty. That&#8217;s
    because there&#8217;s no other pool of money of comparable size to which
    poor people have a legitimate claim.</p>
  <p>The free market notion that those at the bottom of the ladder will somehow
    lift themselves out of poverty, without any capital or property, just isn&#8217;t
    credible any longer. Our economic operating system has long been stacked
    against the poor, and globalization hasn&#8217;t made it any less so. The
    prospects for taxing and spending the poor out of poverty aren&#8217;t much
    brighter. Arguably, such policies reached their zenith in the Johnson era
    of the 1960s, and didn&#8217;t get the job done.</p>
  <p>The reason commons rent-sharing can work is that it&#8217;s driven not only &#8212; or
    even primarily &#8212; by compassion for the poor. Rather, it&#8217;s driven
    primarily by the need to preserve threatened ecosystems. When this problem
    is tackled, the question of who gets commons rent will necessarily arise;
    we can&#8217;t solve the first problem without addressing the latter. We&#8217;ll
    then have to decide whether to take, once again, the commons from the poor,
    or let them share in our joint inheritance.</p>
  <p>The poor&#8217;s claim on commons rent is, of course, no different from
    the claim of middle-income households or the rich: commons rent rightfully
    belongs to everyone. But commons rent, if fully paid, would boost living
    standards for the poor much more than for anyone else. And unlike other forms
    of help for the poor, commons rent can&#8217;t be derided as welfare. It
    is, technically, unearned income, but no more so than dividends received
    by inheritors of private wealth. It&#8217;s property income, and should be
    a universal property right. That, I believe, is a winnable political strategy,
    as well as sound economic policy. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    his collaborators agreed, are gifts from the creator that can&#8217;t be
    taken away. Put slightly differently, they&#8217;re <em><strong>universal
    birthrights</strong></em>.</p>
  <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant bones. They
    guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process, habeas corpus, speedy
    public trials, and secure homes and property. Wisely, the Ninth Amendment
    affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
    shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#8221; In
    that spirit, others have since been added.</p>
  <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
    see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against the state.
    The second included rights against unequal treatment based on race, nationality,
    gender, or sexual orientation. The third wave &#8212; which, historically
    speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists of rights not <em>against</em> things,
    but <em>for</em> things &#8212; free public education, collective bargaining
    for wages, security in old age. They can be thought of as rights necessary
    for the pursuit of happiness.</p>
  <p>What makes this latest wave of birthrights strengthen community is their
    universality. If some Americans could enjoy free public education while others
    couldn&#8217;t, the resulting inequities would divide rather than unite us
    as a nation. The universality of these rights puts everyone in the same boat.
    It spreads risk, responsibility, opportunity, and reward across race, gender,
    economic classes, and generations. It makes us a nation rather than a collection
    of isolated individuals.</p>
  <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from the corporate
    sector. The starting condition for the corporate sector, as we&#8217;ve seen,
    is that the top 5 percent owns more shares than everyone else. The starting
    condition for the commons sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property.</p>
  <p>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers, distinguished
    between <em><strong>pre</strong></em> distribution of property and <em><strong>re</strong></em> distribution
    of income. Under income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and
    transferred to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t popular
    with winners, who tend to control government and the media. Under property <em><strong>pre </strong></em>distribution,
    by contrast, the playing field is leveled by spreading property ownership
    before income is generated. After that, there&#8217;s no need for income
    redistribution; property itself distributes income to all. According to Rawls,
    while income re distribution creates dependency, property predistribution
    empowers.</p>
  <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property from some
    and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth that
    already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing) some of
    that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons, we <em><strong>need</strong></em> to
    propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth now. This twenty-first
    century necessity means we have a chance to save the planet, and as a bonus,
    add a universal birthright.</p>
  <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
    through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common property?
    One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted earlier, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to invest in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments pays yearly dividends
    to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended to any state or nation,
    whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent
    Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The
    reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of the
    population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</p>
  <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
  <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
    worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would pay
    equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell, so
    would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all boats.
    America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>    To build Capitalism 3.0, we each have unique roles to play. I therefore address
      the final pages of this book to a variety of people whose participation
      is critical. ...</p>
  <p><font size="-1">WAGE EARNERS</font></p>
  <p>You had it good for a while. Thanks to labor unions, you lifted yourselves
    into the middle class. You got paid vacations, forty-hour workweeks, time-and-half
    for overtime, health insurance, a pension, and most of all, job security.
    Even companies without unions paid well and offered lifetime employment if
    you wanted it. There was a social contract, if not a legal one, between employers,
    workers, and communities. This was America&#8217;s version of the welfare
    state, and if you were part of it, it wasn&#8217;t bad. But those days are
    dust.</p>
  <p>In today&#8217;s global marketplace, capital moves at the speed of light,
    and you&#8217;re just a cost to be minimized. What management seeks &#8212; what
    capital demands &#8212; is more profit next quarter. Did you give the best
    years of your life to Acme Inc.? Too bad. Nothing boosts the bottom line
    faster than downsizing, outsourcing, or playing games with your pension fund.
    And forget about help from the union; it&#8217;s toothless now. We&#8217;re
    all on our own.</p>
  <p>What can you do? Truthfully, not much. In the era of global capital, your
    form of income &#8212; wages &#8212; is at a serious competitive disadvantage.
    But over time, things can get better. The way out &#8212; for your kids,
    if not for you &#8212; is through a new version of capitalism that gives
    you (and everyone else) property income from a share of common wealth. That
    share is your birthright. It can&#8217;t be downsized or outsourced.</p>
  <p>It pays some dividends in cash, and others in no-fuss health care, free
    Internet access, healthy food, clean air, and lots of places to go fishing.
    So claim your birthright, and your children&#8217;s. Claim it in living rooms,
    at church, in barbershops, and hair salons. This is how movements begin.

<p><strong>&#8220;Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman&#8221;</strong> &#8212; July
  2006: <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/">http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/</a> <font size="-1">The
  following is an edited transcript of a conversation between Hillsdale College
  President Larry Arnn and Milton Friedman, which took place on May 22, 2006,
  at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, California, during a two-day Hillsdale
  College National Leadership Seminar celebrating the 25th anniversary of Milton
  and Rose Friedman's book, <em>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement</em>. </font>excerpt: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em><strong>LA:</strong> Let me ask you about demographic trends.
      Columnist Mark Steyn writes that in ten years, 40 percent of young men
      in the world are going to be living in oppressed Muslim countries. What
      do you think the effect of that is going to be?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> What happens will depend on whether we succeed in bringing
    some element of greater economic freedom to those Muslim countries. Just
    as India in 1955 had great but unrealized potential, I think the Middle East
    is in a similar situation today. In part this is because of the curse of
    oil. Oil has been a blessing from one point of view, but a curse from another.
    Almost every country in the Middle East that is rich in oil is a despotism.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Why do you think that is so?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> One reason, and one reason only &#8212; the oil is
    owned by the governments in question. If that oil were privately owned and
    thus someone's private property, the political outcome would be freedom rather
    than tyranny. This is why <strong>I believe the first step following the
    2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields.
    If the government had given every individual over 21 years of age equal shares
    in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate
    arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and
    developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form
    of dividends to the people &#8212; the shareholders &#8212; rather than into
    government coffers.</strong> This would have provided an income to the whole
    people of Iraq and thereby prevented the current disputes over oil between
    the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, because oil income would have been distributed
    on an individual rather than a group basis.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Many Middle Eastern societies have a kind of tribal
      or theocratic basis and long-held habits of despotic rule that make it
      difficult to establish a system of contract between strangers. Is it your
      view that the introduction of free markets in such places could overcome
      those obstacles?</em></p>
  <p>MF: Eventually, yes. I think that nothing is so important for freedom as
    recognizing in the law each individual's natural right to property, and giving
    individuals a sense that they own something that they're responsible for,
    that they have control over, and that they can dispose of.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public spending should feature
"Citizen Dividends." These are
social dividends limited to citizens, thus discouraging free or
illegal immigration that would dilute the dividends and erode their
voter support. (The degree, pace, and conditions of legal
immigration is an issue to treat separately.) Dividends take many
forms other than outright per head cash grants. The G.I. Bill was a
splendid example. Social Security payments are another. School
equalization payments based on a.d.a. are another. A state or

        the ideas of Henry George</a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
              argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity,
              and are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained
              them from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and
              natural resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every
              one of the N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal
              beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile
              soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own
              vine and his own fig tree.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
              land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
              of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
              Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
              use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
              years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
              owner.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
              of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
              expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
              owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
              a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here
              I am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
              in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making
    the sale price of a piece of land, not including the price of buildings and
    other improvements on
                it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be,
    not the original sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose
    to
                hold his &quot;fair share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would
                pay a land tax about equal to his dividend check, and so would
                break even. By
                1/Nth of the land is meant land with a value equal to 1/Nth of
                the value of all the land in the country.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
              as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to
              hold more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would
              prefer to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check
              representing the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
              at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough
              to feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and
              1/Nth of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population.
              A family of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend
              checks will enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied
              to that land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of
              course, they may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably,
              but the situation from which we start is one in which everyone has his
              own plot of ground from which to wrest a living by the strength of his
              own back, and any deviation from this is the result of voluntary exchanges
              agreed to by the parties directly involved, who judge themselves to be
              better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal.
    In fact, it is extremely conservative, in the sense of being in agreement
    with historic ideas about
                land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles
    or gold or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking
    countries
                uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal
    property (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
                of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
                means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the
                people. Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
                term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain
                is that the landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings
                to the government
                for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply
                to property other than land, although complications arise when
                there are buildings
                on the land that is being seized.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
              support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
              Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
              Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
              F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized
              by Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and
              the Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight
              of the Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the
              proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton
              Friedman</a>, 1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani,
              1985; James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
              S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most
    Georgists today is that cities shall tax land within their boundaries at
    a higher rate than they
                tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone
    is about to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the
                land and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure
                you that real estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard
                practice to make
                the two assessments separately, and a parcel of land in the business
                district of a large city very often has a different owner from
                the building on it.)
                Many cities have moved to a system of taxing land more heavily
                than improvements, and most have been pleased with the results,
                finding that landholders are
                more likely to use their land productively -- to their own benefit
                and that of the public -- if their taxes do not automatically
                go up when they
                improve their land by constructing or maintaining buildings on
                it.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of
    many is that it is a Fabian proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental
                and reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results
                of a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the
                difference in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other
                proposals of the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me
                absolute dictator of the world so that I can supervise the distribution,
                and if it doesn't work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem
                is that absolute dictators seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read
