</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">These ideas are known by a number of
names.&nbsp; Geonomy, Property Tax Shift, Geo-Libertarian, Geo-classical, Georgist,
Community Ground Rent, Land Value Taxation, Single Tax,
...&nbsp; Here are references and etymology for a few of them... <br>
</div>
<br>
Kris Feder: <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html">Progress and Poverty
Today </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist (or "geoclassical")
economic analysis </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>bears directly upon the current difficulties of Russia and
other
nations emerging from communism, upon the international debt crisis,
and upon the world-wide pressure on environmental and natural
resources. </small></li>
  <li><small>It is relevant to the common experience of chronic budget
deficits, both municipal and federal. </small></li>
  <li><small>It can be applied to the problems of corruption in
government,
and of the concentration of political power associated with
concentration of wealth. </small></li>
  <li><small>It provides an ideal framework for the analysis of
environmental
pollution and the design of environmental policy. </small></li>
  <li><small>Indeed, readers will notice that the modern environmental
movement in certain respects seems to be grappling toward a rediscovery
of Georgist proposals.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many American cities are plagued
by the twin problems of urban
decay and suburban sprawl. An expanding network of roads and highways
carries commuters ever farther to their jobs. Fleeing the problems of
the city, citizens build new homes in the quiet countryside only to
find that traffic congestion, pollution, noise and urban social
problems are flung outward with the movement of population.
Sociologists decry the loss of community, while environmentalists
warn of the potentially disastrous consequences of automobile
pollution, habitat loss, deforestation and ecosystem disruption.
Economists point to the billions of dollars worth of wasted physical
and human capital left behind in the crumbling central cities - where
the urban poor remain stranded to fend for themselves, with few jobs
and, as municipal tax revenues shrink, declining public services. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Yet
several years before the automobile appeared, Henry George analyzed
the dynamics of urban growth and decay. He explained the basic
processes that yield an inappropriate geographic distribution of
population, inefficient land use, and urban blight. Enlightened urban
economists and transportation planners today advocate Georgist policy
reforms at the municipal level.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, George's synthesis informs
a research program of remarkable
breadth. Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct
paradigm of political economy, one which reconciles the
contradictions between the two competing paradigms dominant in the
world today - the mainstream neoclassical school, which tends to
focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets, and
Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can
and should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical
economics. What is certain is that geoclassical thought bears
crucially on some of the foremost controversies in America and the
world today.</small> <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html"><small

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Geonomics.html">Basic Principles
of Geonomics</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A geonomy respects the freedom
of individuals, the limits of the
environment, and the claims of future generations. Individuals must
be free to organize their economic lives as they wish, within bounds
determined by the equal freedom of others and the recognition that
land, natural resources and environmental amenities are the common
heritage of all generations.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
To summarize, the basic principles of geonomics are:<br>
<br>
1. Equal sharing of land and natural resources, achieved by:<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>a. public collection of the
rental value of land and of appropriate fees for broadcast rights and
other opportunities that must be assigned exclusively, for depletion of
natural resources, and for causing pollution or engaging in other
activities that reduce the value of surrounding land;</small><br>
<small>b. equal sharing among the population of that part of rent and
other public revenue not attributable to public services;</small></div>
<small>2. Elimination of taxes on labor, capital and enterprise, limiting
government revenue to the items mentioned in 1.a. above;<br>
3. Economic freedom, encompassing free enterprise, free trade, and
freedom to use foreign currencies;<br>
4. Assignment of the ownership of previously centralized enterprises to
all workers in proportion to the number of years they have worked,
through shares in mutual funds whose managers are rewarded in
proportion to the profits earned. ...&nbsp; <a

</span></span>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving Life to the Property Tax Shift
(PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

INTRODUCTORY KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Geonomics</span> (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">geo</span>- earth, -<span
 style="font-style: italic;">onomy </span>law)
is the alternative. It represents the most radical and breathtaking
examination of human rights you'll ever come across, backed up with
detailed economic solutions. But isn't something drastic to be
expected, for an economic and social system like our current one that
is so flawed surely requires a radical remedy? If it's busted big time,
it surely needs to be fixed big time.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Let's approach it from a number of different angles to try and
try to shed light on its many facets. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">philosophical </span>appeal
could be embodied as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Land
and natural resources - the Global Commons - should be the equal and
common birthright of all humanity."</span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>From an <span style="font-weight: bold;">economic </span>perspective,
we could characterise our standpoint as a radical reform of the tax
system and our form of land tenure. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Coming from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">social
justice</span>
angle, we could be seen as striving to abolish all forms of privilege
(including some massive injustices which are presently almost
completely concealed). 
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmentally</span>,
we are
monitoring and conserving a whole range of natural resources, rather
than selling them off forever to the highest cash bidder. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>From <span style="font-weight: bold;">libertarian </span>eyes,
Geonomics restores a number of basic human liberties which are
particularly violated through our current tax system.</small></li>
  <li><small>Putting on our <span style="font-weight: bold;">visionary
    </span>spectacles,
we see a possible world of almost unimaginable prosperity - not in
merely material terms, but with regard to leisure time, our natural
environment, human relations, and personal &amp; spiritual growth.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we appear to be dreamers,
then you should know that the solutions
underlying these grand declarations are expressed in detailed economic
policies rather than vague principles and motherhood statements.
Furthermore, these policies have been put to the test in many parts of
the Western world. While Geonomists are agreed on important issues,
some still disagree on a number of minor aspects - but it will be some
time before we need to get to this level of detail.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Essentially, the basis of our proposals is the replacement of
nearly
all forms of taxation with a system of rentals or taxes on the Global
Commons, in particular on land values. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Prosper Australia (also known as EarthSharing) and its far-flung
sister
organisations are brought together by a social conscience underpinned
by a belief that there really is a practical way to a much more just,
green and prosperous society. Because our proposals are so radical,
far-reaching and thereby so difficult to briefly describe, perhaps it's
no surprise that it goes under so many names, such as:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Geonomics - this is the term mainly used here</small></li>
  <li><small>Land Value Taxation</small></li>
  <li><small>Georgist Economics or Georgism</small></li>
  <li><small>Community Ground Rent</small></li>
  <li><small>Site Value Rating &middot; EarthSharing</small></li>
  <li><small>Ground Rent Collection</small></li>
  <li><small>Land Value Recapture</small></li>
  <li><small>Resource Rentals</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Prosper Australia is the new
name for an organisation that is over 100
years old. It is an educational body set up to advance the cause of
Geonomics, in particular through the ideas of Henry George. Presently,
while we are expanding our numbers, we are an educational rather than a
political organisation. There are allied organisations all over the
world, mainly in English-speaking countries. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>We are philanthropists of a sort, all working for the love of a
great
cause except for our office manager who receives a very modest
allowance. We see ourselves striving to bring about a vision of an
immeasurably-improved world seen through our studies of a radical
economic and social system. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Some of us consider ourselves followers of the 19th century
American
social philosopher and economist, Henry George, and hence call
ourselves Georgists. Henry George didn't "invent" Geonomics or
Georgism, but he did rediscover it and elaborate its finer details and
full consequences more than anyone else to date. Unbeknown to George,
some of the world's greatest thinkers had already independently
proposed much the same thing - Rousseau, Spinoza, Voltaire, the French
Physiocrats, Paine, Jefferson, Cobden, Carlyle and Mill are just a
few.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Williams_IdK.html"><span

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
automobile.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Geonomics draws its power to
predict and fix what ails economies
by being grounded in reality. It holds to the notion that economies
are not apart from but part of the embracing eco-system. As part of
whole, economies self-regulate by the same natural feedback loops.
The prey/predator cycle is mimicked by the pricing cycle, also known
as the <b>Law of Supply and Demand</b>. This familiar pattern is
found, too, in the <b>Share Rent Cycle</b>.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>(1)&nbsp; Getting more rent, people work less, so
output drops. <br>
(2)&nbsp; Less output lowers land values and deflates the rent-share. <br>
(3)&nbsp; Getting less rent, people work more. <br>
(4) More output raises site values and swells the rent-share. <br>
(1) Again, ad infinitum. </small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, production is put into
balance with consumption and work
with play. Geonomics yields a policy that's not at war with but
aligned with nature as model. Perhaps the most central feature of
economics is price. Price is to production what DNA is to
reproduction, the guides to growth. Rather than distort price with
taxes and subsidies, with license (so-called "externalities") and
rent-retention, geonomics respects the integrity of price, allowing
it to accurately reflect our costs and values, by sharing rent. Then
economies ("geonomies") can operate without the deadweight losses of
taxation and rent seeking. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To sustain that which we love, we
must transform our relationships
to nature, to government, and to each other. We need to become
geonomists in worldview, theory, discipline, and policy. Geonomics
creates an economy that's not at war with but aligned with the
natural world. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

</small>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Geoist_Crusoe.html">A
Geoist Robinson Crusoe Story
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, Robinson G.
Crusoe was the only survivor of a ship
that sunk. He floated on a piece of wood to an unpopulated island.
Robinson was an absolute geoist. He believed with his mind, heart, and
soul that everyone should have an equal share of land rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Since he was the only person on this island, it was all his. He
surveyed the island and found that the only crop available for
cultivation was alfalfa sprouts. The land was divided into 5 grades
that could grow 8, 6, 4, 2, and zero bushels of alfalfa sprouts per
month. There was one acre each for 8, 6, and 4, and 100 acres of
2-bushel land. For 8 hours per day of labor, he could work 4 acres. So
he could grow, per month, 8+6+4+2 = 20 bushels of alfalfa sprouts, much
more than enough to feed on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>One day another survivor of a sunken ship floated to the island.
His
name was Friday George. Friday was a boring talker and kept chattering
about trivialities, which greatly irritated Robinson. "I possess the
whole island. You may only have this rocky area," said Robinson. ... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>In the Georgist view,
this economic rent is the public&#8217;s birthright,<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">47</span></small>
and
the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises approximately a third of the economy as it is currently
calculated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Arrangements such as these are to the followers of Henry
George a far more efficient and moral system of public finance. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS OF SYNTHESIS OF GEORGIST
AND
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS</span></small><br>
<small>The commonalities of Georgist economics and ecological economics
appear
to be organizable into six general points: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) preservation of the commons, <br>
2) sustainable development, <br>
3) appropriate valuation of natural capital, <br>
4) ensuring social and biological community, <br>
5) fostering individual self-realization, and <br>
6) securing economic justice. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all these points is
the view that market activity needs to
be circumscribed and juxtaposed to the non-human, biological realm. It
appears that there is lots to be gained by some synthesis of the two
fields of discourse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ecological economists worry about the encroachment, and even the
elimination, of those elements of nature to which private property
title has not been granted. In their concern about the need to protect
the &#8220;commons,&#8221; they are torn between the view that only through
privatization can all the world&#8217;s assets be preserved and the
alternative view that any private appropriation of the commons
constitutes a moral compromise. They fear a repeat of Garrett Hardin&#8217;s
&#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221; Their argument often proposed is rather
complex to explicate: it assumes that private property titles may
perhaps provide the best incentive not to exploit the fruits of the
earth and the earth itself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">126</span></small> To
Georgists, on the other hand, the earth and all its resources are
already in fact the birthright of all humanity; individuals are
entitled to its use in return for the payment of rents. Further
privatization is anathema. The key rather is in distinguishing the
various components of ownership and getting prices right&#8212; mainly in the
collection of economic rents.... <a

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marxism was never a major force in
United States; the primary
challenge to the classical tradition came from what has since come to
be known as neo-classical economics.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
travelled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and travelled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather thabeing returned
to society in rent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The failure of society to
recapture the appropriate level of land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885.</b> The
actual intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got
appointed and promoted, who was funded in research, which were given
endowed chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation
with defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount
preoccupation of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. Was it for the falsity
of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then have
managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather, it
was the threat George represented to powerful interests that required
him to be defeated, and in doing so they succeeded but only in the
short run, as they were within decades victims of their very
successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base.</small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Those economists who today
still persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists</b>. They represent a
small
minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they are,
they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two-factor economics, however,
had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit.</b> This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. <b>In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner.</b> When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
