  <p>Some of what falls into the category of "small business" is actually
  landlording, and often it is also largely speculating on land value.&nbsp; We
  need to make a clearer distinction in our common conversation, and in how we
  set
  up
  our
  incentives. What
  do we want to reward? What do we want to encourage? Conversely, what do we
  want to discourage? What behavior do we specifically <em>not</em> want to reward?  </p>
  <p>In the central business district of most towns, the building owners are
    the same entities (or families) now as they were 10, 20 and 30 years ago.
    The tenants may have changed: over the years, there has probably been a series
    of signs
    in
    the
    windows:
     &quot;grand opening,&quot; &quot;lost our lease, everything must go,&quot; &quot;under
    new
    management.&quot; But the landlords remain the same, and the buildings remain
    the same. If the local economy is healthy, and local government invests in
    good schools and services and maintains the infrastructure well, those landlords
    can collect higher and higher rents on those buildings, making it harder
    and harder for the tenant to afford to locate in the prime locations. Eventually,
    the landlord turns day to day responsibility over to a management company,
    and retires to a more hospitable climate, receiving the rent check there,
    and paying back to the town a small amount in property taxes.</p>
  <p>Every dollar that a commercial tenant spends on rent is a dollar not available
    for wages, inventory or specialized equipment. And when he does succeed in
    making
    a profit, we tax that profit. We also tax his employees' wages and if he
    is a retailer, the purchases his customers make &#8212;  in order to provide
    schools and services and infrastructure which will allow the landlord to
    charge him
    higher rent next time the lease is to be renewed. (See <a href="Pork.html">pork</a> for
    a similarly perverse cycle.)</p>
  <p>Many of us dream of opening our own businesses. Most of those plans somehow
    involve having access to a prime, or at least adequate, site on which to
    conduct that business. Without it, and without it being affordable, our business
    plan must remain a castle in the air.</p>
  <p>And then there are the entrepreneurs who are ready to retire. They take
    a look at their business, and, if they are the owners of the site on which
    they have conducted their business, they may reach the conclusion that they
    can live just as comfortably by renting that site to someone else, and &quot;letting&quot;
    that other person do the work. We may be used to this, but is it just? Is
    there a difference between being able to rent out one's building and renting
    out a site? Is one equally entitled to privatize, to keep as one's own treasure,
    the value of the building and the value of the site? Or are they fundamentally
    different in character? Most people who have read <a href="About_HG.html">Henry
    George's</a> book <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
    and Poverty</a></em> acknowledge that the difference between land and building,
    or capital, is an important distinction, which needs to be acknowledged by
    how we tax ourselves.</p>
  <p>Look around you at the &quot;small business&quot; people you know. Group
    together in your mind those who own the sites on which they conduct their
    businesses
    &#8212; be that retail, service, professional, whatever &#8212; and those
    who are tenants. They may not be very different in how hard they work, or
    the
    skill or training
    they bring to their work, but their fortunes are likely to be quite different.
     (And then consider the other group: the landlords.) Is this the kind of
    society we want? Land value taxation is the simple reform which will begin
    to change
    this
    situation;
    other measures
    can
    do little
    or
    nothing.</p>

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> This is the secret which would transform the little village into the
      great city.*</li>
    <li> With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
          the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed
      of.</li>
    <li> This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212; a
          new surplus which society might take for general purposes.</li>
    <li> And released from the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue
          in a way that begets corruption and renders legislation the tool of
      special interests, society could assume functions which the increasing
      complexity
          of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
          demoralization under the present system now leads thoughtful men to
      shrink from.
        <p><font size="-1">*At the beginning of <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Book
                IX </a>of the complete Progress &amp; Poverty, Henry George quotes from
                Themistocles: &quot;I cannot play upon any stringed instrument, but I
                can tell you how of a little village to make a great and glorious city.&quot;</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
      blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
      from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
      present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
      on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
            be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
            economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
            The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
            of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging all
            the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value of
            land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
            to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of such
            a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
            land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of
            former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
            to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
            after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will
            be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
      land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
      land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
      most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
      to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
      attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
      would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
      field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
      have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
          of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his
      neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
      warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                  have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                  Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                  cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                  save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                  the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                  purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                  lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                  (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                  in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                  It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                  relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                  price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                  its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                  paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                  but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                  other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.
                  H.G.B.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other
      for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
    of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
    and
      wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
    would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
      competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
      demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to
      bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
      and increased
      profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
      upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
      monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into
          the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
  <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
  <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every hand.

    12. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3. Of the effect upon individuals
    and classes</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic, storekeeper, or
      professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives, and
      which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot
      be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he
      will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish -- theoretically
      it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear. It
      will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other lots
      will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
      of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
      as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a loser
      by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
      to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead
      owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a larger
      lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of their own,
      he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present, other
      things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have more
      taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house and
      improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that he and
      his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
      by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
      of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
      another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain. ...</p>
  <p>In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well as
      a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made. His
      loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
      is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
      or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
      a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
      but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; <em>The

<br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included
either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which are neither
land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these two original
factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

<br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book

  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
      <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
    <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>WITH profits this inquiry has manifestly nothing to do. We want to find
    what it is that determines the division of their joint produce between land,
    labor, and capital, and profits is not a term that refers exclusively to
    anyone of these three divisions. Of the three parts into which profits are
    divided by political economists &#8212; namely, compensation for risk, wages
    of superintendence, and return for the use of capital &#8212; the latter
    falls under the term interest, which includes all the returns for the use
    of capital, and excludes everything else; wages of superintendence falls
    under the term wages, which includes all returns for human exertion, and
    excludes everything else; and compensation for risk has no place whatever,
    as risk is eliminated when all the transactions of a community are taken
    together.&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp031.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp031.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> INTEREST, as an abstract term in the distribution of wealth, differs in
    meaning from the word as commonly used, in this: That it includes all returns

  <p><strong><font size="-1">I. THE SINGLE TAX DEFINED</font></strong></p>
  <p>The practical form in which Henry George puts the idea of appropriating
    economic rent to common use is &quot;To abolish all taxation save that upon
    land values.&quot;</p>
  <p>This is now generally known as &quot;The Single Tax.&quot;2 Under its operation
    all classes of workers, whether manufacturers, merchants, bankers, professional
    men, clerks, mechanics, farmers, farm-hands, or other working classes, would,
    as such, be wholly exempt. It is only as men own land that they would be
    taxed, the tax of each being in proportion, not to the area, but to value
    of his land. And no one would be compelled to pay a higher tax than others
    if his land were improved or used while theirs was not, nor if his were better
    improved or better used than theirs.3 The value of its improvements would
    not be considered in estimating the value of a holding; site value alone
    would govern.4 If a site rose in the market the tax would proportionately
    increase; if that fell, the tax would proportionately diminish.</p>
  <p>The single tax may be concisely described as a tax upon land alone, in the
    ratio of value, irrespective of improvements or use.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
      receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
      pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
      of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption
      in government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute
      to the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production,
      to crush legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions
      it raises are of vastly more concern than is indicated by the sum total
      of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers, enters
        into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate of profit upon
        that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the
        manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price
        and are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the tax with
        all intermediate profits upon it, together with their :usual rate of profit
        upon the whole, from final purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what
        appears on the surface to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination
        to be an indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of
        profits upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were imposed
        upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount of the
        tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect
        the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
        and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with their profit
        from retailers, who would collect with their profit from shoe consumers.
        The principle applies also when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales
        of merchants, or the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with
        the usual profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
        interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000;
        at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
        and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
        of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would
        get. Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that
        indirect
        taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed
        only upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed
        upon materials
        also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent in
        addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect taxes from
        the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers,
        or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest,
        it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is because
        the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other
        tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
        goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business. It
        follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase the price
        of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must
        pay as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the cost
        of their output as is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of
        the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase
        the price of their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as
        the tax is more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
        such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
        copyright publications
        is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly manufacturer whose
        prices are not checked by cost of production, and are therefore as a
      rule higher than competitive prices would be, may find it more profitable
      to bear
        the burden of a tax that leaves him some profit, by preserving his entire
        custom, than to drive off part of his custom by adding the tax to his
      usual prices. This is true also of a moderate import tax to the extent
      it falls
        upon goods that are more cheaply transported from the place of production
        to a foreign market where the import tax is imposed than to a home market
        where the goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance,
        of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian
        town. If the tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation
        the producer will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate
        effect would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
        may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
        will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
        cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">9. &quot;To collect taxes, to prevent and punish evasions, to check and
            countercheck revenue drawn from so many distinct sources, now make up probably
            three-fourths, perhaps seven-eighths, of the business of government outside
            of the preservation of order, the maintenance of the military arm, and the
            administration of justice.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv,
          ch: v</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">10. For a brief and thorough exposition of indirect taxation
            read George's &quot;Protection
          or Free Trade,&quot; ch. viii, on &quot; Tariffs for Revenue.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11 <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</font></strong><br />
<br />
To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and now,
in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in proportion
to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government must use
land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government is poor
to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits of good
government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many and fully
enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government are available,
or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest and most
available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would work or live
where the benefits of government are available, and does not already own land
there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other things
being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that the site
he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service of government
in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public which provides
the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor government
        than in any country of better government, other things being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government. Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.
    But landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts,
    and of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and
    the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with
    the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their

    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
        respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence and
        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
        exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
        for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
        if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down; they
        have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be 'held up'
        and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out in the spring,
        your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs, and if you walk you
        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.
        Isn't it worth a hundred and fifty dollars a year more for a building
        site here than over in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
        But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,
        what would be the conversation if your sense of the fitness of things
        were not warped by familiarity with false systems of taxation? Would
        it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
        the assessor. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
        your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
        for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire department?
        Are not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world?
        Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks,
        and electric street lights, and a first class water supply? Don't you
        suppose these things cost something? And don't you think you ought to
        pay your share?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or less calmness; &quot;I
        do have the benefit of these things, and I do think that I ought to pay
        my share toward supporting them. But I have already paid my share for
        this year. I have paid it to the owner of this lot. He charges me two
        hundred and fifty dollars a year -- one hundred and fifty dollars more
        than I should pay or he could get but for those very benefits. <em>He</em> has
        collected my share of this year's expense of maintaining town improvements;
        you go and collect from him. If you do not, but insist upon collecting
        from me, I shall be paying twice for these things, once to him and once
        to you; and he won't be paying at all, but will be making money out of
        them, although he derives the same benefits from them in all other respects
        that I do.&quot; <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></font></p>

    when he complains of &quot;hard times&quot; is that people do not employ him as much

<blockquote>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger.<strong> The possibility of this danger would
    be still further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer
    greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. </strong>And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. </p>
  <p><em>Q46. How can it be possible that speculative land values cause business
    depressions when, as any business man will tell you, the whole item of land
    value &#8212; whether ground rent or interest on purchase money &#8212; is
    one of the smallest items in every business?</em><br>
    A. You overlook the fact that the item of speculative rent is the only item
    which the business man does not get back again. The cost of his goods, the
    expense of clerk hire, the rent of his building, the wear and tear of implements,
    are all received back, in the course of normal business, in the prices of
    his goods. Even his ground rent, to the extent that it is normal (i.e., what
    it would be if the supply of land were determined alone by land in use, and
    not affected by the land that is held out of use for higher values), comes
    back to him in the sense that his aggregate profits are that much greater
    than they would be where ground rent was less. But the extra ground rent
    which he is obliged to pay, in consequence of the abnormal scarcity of land,
    is a dead weight; it does not come back to him. Therefore, even if infinitesimal
    in amount, as compared with the other expenses of his business &#8212; and
    that is by no means admitted &#8212; it is the one expense which may break
    a thriving business down. Besides, it is not alone the ground rent paid by
    the business man for his location that bears down upon his business prosperity;
    the weight of abnormally high land values in general presses upon business
    in general, and by obstructing the flow of trade forces the weaker business
    units to the wall. It is not altogether safe to deduce general economic principles
    from the ledgers of particular business houses. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<br>
<small>The characteristics of land are well known. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Land has a fixed supply. The space within some boundary

people, who can migrate, or capital goods, which are more or less

  <li><small>Land cannot be imported. Even in the case of buildings and
other
permanent structures, they differ from land in that they are created by
human enterprise, and in that their creators decide where the structure
will be located. </small></li>

        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
        One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to
    use it. Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability
      to
        control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from the
      increase in its price. <strong>With most of the geo-rent tapped for public revenue,
      the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the economy, since
      with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land would instead go
      to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide better training.</strong></p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If
    a landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to
    pass
      on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would
    be invisible to renters, the link between using public services and paying
    for them would
      be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent, so that
    link is there. If government revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not
    generate
      rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce
    land value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue would come from
    the
      landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no different than the
    situation today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no property tax,
    and typically
      they get government assistance. This is an argument not against the use
    of rent, but in favor of privatizing government programs. In the private
    sector,
      the link between ownership and control is stronger. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
    Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
    and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of
    local public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
    don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
    to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not taxed
    if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation reduces
    the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
    funds in an enterprise. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole

    Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
    Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
applied these inherent differences
between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
reduce the price of land." </small><br>
<br>
<small>Here, then is another derivative difference between land and
products, according to George: taxation on products causes an
increase in the price of products; taxation on the value of land
causes a drop in the price of land.&nbsp; ... <a

principal.&nbsp; The buyer must find the excess elsewhere.&nbsp; A poor

open entry to most businesses, and a weak one excludes a large minority

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because market agents expect
land to last
forever they price it
accordingly, high enough so the net cash flow just covers interest on
the
price, with nothing left over to pay for the principal.&nbsp; Thus the
land buyer will never normally (or "in equilibrium") pay for it
from its own cash flow, as he will pay for capital assets.&nbsp; The
debtor will never retire the loan from the cash flow of the land, but
only from other saving, or from new windfalls not expected at time of
purchase.&nbsp; A new buyer with no equity, therefore, is a bad credit
risk and gets short shrift at the bank. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Those of poor credit ratings are
peculiarly handicapped in the
market for land titles.&nbsp; This is because the carrying cost of land
is interest, and because there is a structure of interest rates based
on
borrowers' credit ratings.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Those with existing cores of rent-yielding land -- &#8220;existing
nuclei&#8221; --
enjoy a continual flow of discretionary funds they can use to buy more
land.&nbsp; The advantage of a head start snowballs over time.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Buying with equity funds is only the beginning.&nbsp; Land is
the basis
for extending credit.&nbsp; The "sections" go to the banks for
accommodation to buy the "quarters."&nbsp; As Rainer Schikele wrote,
"The basis of credit is not marginal productivity, but collateral
security." A major factor giving one a good credit rating is the prior
ownership of land.&nbsp; <strong>.... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"></a>Massed control of
land is the most
natural base for monopolizing
markets because land is limited.&nbsp; Buying land always does double
duty: when A expands he <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>
preempts opportunities from B. For
example, a chain of service stations with most of the best comers in a
town has market power, the more so if it also holds a large share of
oil
sources, of refinery sites, of "offset rights" to pollute air,
transmission rights of way, harbor sites, and other such limited
lands.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Preemption is not always just a by-product of expansion; it may
be the
main point.&nbsp; For example, in 1993 Builders'
Emporium, a large chain of California hardware stores with large
parking
lots in good locations, closed down and sold out.&nbsp; The sites were
bought up by the largest grocery chain in southern California, Vons
Company.&nbsp; According to news reports, this is "a shut-out strategy
against competitors."&nbsp; Vons will convert 6-8 Emporium stores to
Vons' markets, and "hold onto the others until commercial rents rebound
-- then market them to non-rivals."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Salomon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler, far from being shocked,
praises
this as "ingenious."&nbsp; "You're controlling who's in your market
area."&nbsp; Ralphs, another grocery chain, had been looking for sites
and is now shut out.&nbsp; The stores
remain empty today; the land idle.&nbsp; <a

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<small><strong>...</strong> Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.

</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small> ...<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
    for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The idea of renting a site to the highest bidder is conceptually more complex
    than selling it to the highest bidder, because different users can be expected
    to desire to use a site for different spans of time. Suppose that one person
    bids 1,000 rubles per year for 20 years and another bids 1,100 rubles per year
    for 30 years. Which bid is higher? To compare these bids, one must know what
    someone else would pay for the use of the site twenty years hence, and one
    must also know the appropriate discount rate for the next thirty years. These
    difficulties of comparing bids for different terms can be avoided by renting
    sites just one year at a time. This annual rent-setting procedure also guarantees
    future generations that they will not be disadvantaged by being bound by the
    terms of agreements in which they did not participate, and which disposed of
    their heritage for a small
  fraction of its value.</p>
  <p>The idea of renting sites one year at a time may sound unpromising at first.
    The efficient use of land generally requires improvements that last for many
    years. How can entrepreneurs be expected to improve land if they are only permitted
    to rent it for one year at a time? The answer is that entrepreneurs can be
    expected to make durable improvements to land even under these circumstances,
    provided that they have the opportunity to continue to use the land they have
    improved, for a price that is determined in a fair and impartial manner.</p>
  <p>The risks associated with uncertainties are customarily borne, for a price,
    by entrepreneurs. Uncertainty in the future price of using land, like uncertainty
    in the future price of any other input or product, can be accommodated by entrepreneurs.</p>
  <p>The kind of uncertainty that will significantly deter potential investors
    is uncertainty associated with a climate that invites tax increases or other
    rule changes that extract additional money from investors, taking advantage
    of the fact that investment in durable improvements has occurred. To attract
    investment, governments must do what they can to commit themselves not to take
    confiscatory action once investment has occurred. This commitment is accomplished
    by settled rules, by public respect for property in a democratic system, and
    by a system of public finance that provides adequate revenue for necessary
    expenditures and curbs the tendency of politicians to spend excessively. The
    future rent of land can accordingly be uncertain without discouraging investment,
    provided that the process used to determine rent is settled and does not confiscate
    capital.</p>
  <p>The question at issue can thus be restated as, "What process can be used to
    determine the rental value of land, one year at a time, in such a way that
    the full rent of land is collected, while at the same time insuring that entrepreneurs
    are not required to pay extra amounts by virtue of having made durable improvements
    to land?" ...</p>
  <p>What is new is the suggestion regarding how a society can receive, in all
    future years, the full rental value of land that it turns over to private management:
    Just charge for each site, in each year, the amount people offer for the use
    of similar land for that year when they know that future rents will be determined
    in the same way. By collecting all rent without burdening those who improve
    land, this
  simple rule maintains land as the heritage of all generations. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read the whole article</a></p>
