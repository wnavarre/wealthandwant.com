    in their well-being.&nbsp; We deserve this, right?&nbsp; Are we not of The
    Greatest Generation (how we love that toadying title)?&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But how will your grandchildren afford a home at
    today's prices?&nbsp; We get the increment, but they get the excrement.&nbsp;</span> Oh,
    well, the plunging dollar, crumbling infrastructure, far-called navies and
    troops melting away, soaring interest rates, higher taxes, incredible public
    debts coming due ... it'll all be different soon.&nbsp; We may all grow poor
    together.</small></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by human
    beings. If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers
    will make
    more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot
    be increased. If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen:
    its
  price will go up. </p>
  <p>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
      no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an
    immediate need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait,
    because they
      expect the land's value to increase with time.</p>
  <p> That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem
    of poverty.</p>
  <p> That is why millions upon millions of people who are willing and able to
    work cannot find work, even while millions upon millions of acres of useable
    land (city land, industrial land, farm land, you name it) are held idle. </p>
  <p>This leads to no end of problems. In the United States, it brings urban
    blight and suburban sprawl, which disrupt communities, and waste energy and
    resources.
    You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal? Consider the fact
    that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its land, or 18.6 square
    miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not parks or streets. And, of
    course, a great deal more land in New York, as in every other city, is used
    somewhat, but far less than the local economy would support. New York City
    has about 80 people per acre of residential land. That means that New York&#8217;s
    vacant land could house another 956,000 people at current density levels,
    without even starting to use its vast stock of under-used land.</p>
  <p> Even though downtowns are underbuilt, people want to move away from the
    high prices and high crime rates they often find there &#8212; so development leapfrogs,
    using far more land than is necessary, jacking up the price of farmland near
    the city &#8212; so that local farms can no longer compete. All this sprawl
    creates more and more need for roads &#8212; provided by tax dollars, of course.
    With all these roads, and all these cars, public transportation systems become
    less popular and harder to finance. This chokes the cities with even more traffic,
    making them even less desirable places to be. Meanwhile, all these subsidized
    highways are just great for the big trucks, burning subsidized fuel, carrying
    imported merchandise to all the big-box stores and franchise restaurants of
    suburbia. In other words: two of the hugest problems that progressives are
    trying to address today &#8212; the decay of communities and the rise of the
    corporate big box &#8212; are all about the land.</p>
  <p> Around the world, it gives too much power to the banks, for land is by
    far the greatest source of collateral for loans, everywhere. The more money
    we
    have to pay for land, the more power we give to the banks. Although 66% of
    American families own their homes, the overall net equity of American home &#8220;owners&#8221; is
    only 18%.</p>
  <p> It&#8217;s all about treating the land as an &#8220;asset.&#8221; ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

  Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_UIaRiCRE.html">Unearned increments and
  reality
  in California's recall
election</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California homeowners are
wallowing in unearned increments beyond
the dreams of avarice, while its governments are courting bankruptcy. <a
 href="../docs/Buffett_Prop13.html">Warren Buffett</a> dared point
this out, and overnight changed from
the Oracle of Omaha into the Numbskull of Nebraska because he does
not understand the "reality of California politics," the oxymoron du
jour.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most candidates for Governor fled
like startled deer. Buffett's
sponsor, well-tailored Mr. Muscles, recalled meeting a tearful widow
who said she would have been taxed out of her home were it not for
Prop 13. Poor thing, her home had risen in value. No one asked her
name, or whether she knew what she was talking about, or had her
claims audited - being a tearful widow "on a fixed income" insulates
one from reality checks. The press chimed in with pix of poster
oldsters, gazing from their multi-million dollar perches over the
blue Pacific, fretting about Buffett's solecism and its possible
effect on them, never mind anyone else.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fact
is, unearned increments ARE income, at the time they accrue. Illiquid?
They are better than cash income because you can turn them
into cash by borrowing on them, and pay no income tax on the cash. </span>If
you have trouble with that, the tax man himself will arrange it
for you by placing a tax lien on your appreciated home, rather than
foreclose and evict you. This helps explain why we never actually
see one of these evicted widows suffering from unearned increments --
they are maudlin figments for mythmakers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The evictees we do see
are renters who couldn't pay, and had no equity to mortgage. Who
cries for them?</span> ...</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Governor Gray Davis, supposedly
fighting to close a deficit,
chimed in endorsing Prop 13, citing the mythical widow again to
explain why non-residential property, about 2/3 of the tax base,
should enjoy low rates. Faced with a negative poll, he backed right
down from his "land tax on wheels," the higher vehicle registration
fee.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>"Home equity" (actually, site equity), the only
equity most people
have, would be consumed by the land dues. Eventho' the complete <i>geonomic</i>
tax shift would let people improve their homes, increase their incomes,
expand their businesses, and augment their savings without increasing
their tax liability, homeowners would still lose their "home equity."
Proponents need to lead off with the bottom line and underscore the
fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">even with lost equity,
numbers show a vast majority would pay
less were taxes shifted. Those savings could be invested in stocks or
bonds for an equivalent return. And were the new policy to include a
per capita rebate, then the geonomic package would merely convert one's
expected equity into a certain annuity. Instead of cashing in one big
lump sum later, residents would be cashing in smaller amounts all
along. ...<br>
<br>
</span></small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big
solution which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Construction -
    Sprawl vs. Eco-City</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. This social surplus is why developers build sprawl,
        not car-free villages. Rent, so-called "equity," is what homeowners borrow
        against for a bout of consumeritis. </li>
    <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The property tax assessment is skewed toward the
      building, away from the land, benefiting speculators and developers, not
      owners. Localities
          often abate the tax for years for developers and major corporations
      who sprawl on new campuses. </li>
    <li><b><i>License</i></b>: The price of new homes too close to streams or
      on freshly cleared hillsides does not include the cost of washing out the
      homebuyers
          or their neighbors.</li>
    <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>: Where new homes go in, localities pick up the
      tab for new schools and infrastructure, saving developers $25,000 per home
      (Better
          Not Bigger, Eben Fodor, 1999). When people build on floodplains and
      get flooded out, the federal government bails them out (National Wetlands
      Newsletter,
          1993, Scott Faber). ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Henry David Thoreau said the best thing government can do for business is
    get out of it. Nevertheless, some hope to shift subsidies from grey bads to
    green goods. Yet the state need not subsidize at all. It's dauntingly difficult
    to know whom to fund; a solar steam generator may be the most promising idea
    one day while photovoltaics are the next. Efficient alternatives don't need
    largesse but fairness. A handout shields new industry from the forces that
    compel efficient growth. The best thing government can do for the environment
  is exit environmental enterprise. ... <a href="docs/Smith_SS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
