<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ...</p>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other
      for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
    of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
    and
      wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
    would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
      competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
      demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to
      bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
      and increased
      profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
      upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
      monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into
          the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
    <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
    <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
      hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax
on capital value of undeveloped land</span>&nbsp; But there is another
proposal concerning land values which is not less
important. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or
suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of the land monopolist
as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not take that view of
the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Dogs_in_the_Manger.html">dog-in-the-manger</a></span>
game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
-- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with
regard to the land, and its effects will be, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>first, to raise an expanding revenue for the needs of the
State; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>secondly, half the proceeds of this tax, as well as of the
other
land taxes, will go to the municipalities and local authorities
generally to relieve rates; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>thirdly,<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> the effect
will be, as we believe, to bring land into the market, and thus
somewhat cheapen the price at which land is obtainable for every
object, public and private, and by so doing we shall liberate new
springs of enterprise and industry, we shall stimulate building,
relieve overcrowding, and promote employment.</span></small><small>... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker
of the US
Congress, is oft-quoted that "All politics is local politics." One
might say the same
of market power. Some lands are sold or leased with covenants against
competition, as Gimbel's Department Store holds a covenant
on a lot adjoining its parent store on 3rd Street and
Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive
arrangements, however blatant, are intra-state, and apparently
immune from sanctions under US Federal anti-trust laws.&nbsp;
Scholars of industrial organization, many of them doing
outstanding work otherwise, pay these grass-roots matters little
heed.&nbsp; Researchers and activists concentrate on commodity markets
at national and world levels - the ones subject to Federal
sanctions, such as they are.&nbsp; They could probably find more
severe and blatant market failure in local land markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
has.&nbsp; A large landowner with a chain of holdings in different
jurisdictions is positioned to bargain, to play off one against the
other.&nbsp; Thus, the Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered
rebuilding
and expanding Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or in Long
Beach
where it had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp; Using this
leverage
it won concessions from both cities, "finally" choosing to
expand in Anaheim.&nbsp; It has yet to do so, however, and nothing is
really final.&nbsp; Disney has many other sites around the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Likewise, land is a basis for oligopsony power in local labor
markets.
A city's labor pool is often faced with a local employers'
association whose membership is limited by the amount of industrial
land
within reach of the labor pool.&nbsp; Migrant farm labor is
faced with statewide employers' associations who have the advantages of
limited numbers, wealth, ancient roots and stability.&nbsp; Labor
unions that organize a local plant are faced with the threat of
the "runaway shop", or merely reallocating work among
plants, when the employer owns plants elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Custom has dulled us to it, but a corporation is a pool of
separate
individual landowners bargaining in concert.&nbsp; A century ago,
corporations and limited liability were viewed with suspicion and
apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and thousands of separate
landowners
pool their corporate strength against labor, as a matter of
course.&nbsp;
Some employees bargain through unions, but not as a matter of
course, and hardly ever with international options.&nbsp; In the
US, less than 20% of the labor force is unionized, yet many,
probably most economists treat labor as the only threatening
monopoly.&nbsp; They see corporations as benign; a prime cause
carried by many economists today is to eliminate the corporate
income tax completely.&nbsp; Would we saw such support
for eliminating the payroll tax, the most obvious cause of
unemployment. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's tax program stimulates
both the demand side and the
supply side. Here is the gist of why it works where other methods
fail. <b> A land tax spurs landowners to use land to earn cash to pay
the taxes. A land tax creates pressure on owners to hire and produce
more; other taxes create pressures to hire and produce less.</b> That
works because it is a fixed charge: it cannot be avoided by
underusing land, and it is not increased by using it. It applies
leverage to landowners, just as would a fixed debt service. Leverage
means that a landowner, by raising gross output 20%, for example, may
raise his net income by 100%.</small></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It created jobs without
inflation, and raised government revenue
without any penalty upon its base.</span> </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a

are, they are among its most esteemed members.... <a

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The Taxable Surplus
    of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable surplus is also what you
        can tax without driving land into the wrong use.</span> It is not enough
        that the land supply is fixed: a tax must not force underuse or other
        misuse of the fixed supply. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of taxing rent is
that it does not change the ranking of land uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let
me explain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
In a free market, the function of rent is to sort and arrange land uses: landowners
allocate land to those uses yielding the most net product, or rent. Economists
have shown (and you can easily see) that this is socially advantageous: the net
product is the excess of revenue over all costs, so land yielding the highest
rent is adding its utmost to the national product. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
When you base your tax on the net product (or rent), the ranking of rival land
uses remains the same after-tax as it was before-tax. That is, if use "A" yields
20% more rent than use "B", and a tax takes 50% of the rent, then use A still
yields the owner 20% more after-tax than use B, and the owner still prefers use
A. We will see below, (<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">Section
D</a>), that when you tax something other than rent (say the Gross Revenue, G),
you will drive the land into less intensive uses, or out of use altogether. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A related advantage of taxing rent
is that you can often levy the tax on the land's <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>to
yield rent, regardless of what use the owner actually chooses.</span> This is,
indeed, a standard way of taxing rent in most capitalist nations. It is possible
because buyers and sellers trade land based on their careful estimates of its
maximum rent-yielding capability. The tax valuer observes and records these value
data, and uses them to place a value on all comparable lands. Many books and
manuals and professional journals have been published on the techniques used:
it is a well established art, with its own professional associations, of which
our speaker Mr. Gwartney is a leading member. <br>
&nbsp; <br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a tax is limited to the maximum possible
rent, and so will not exceed a landowner's ability to pay - provided he uses
the land in the most economical manner (which is not always the most intensive
manner). It will surely not interfere with his using the land in the best way,
but will discourage using it any other way. ...</span></small></p>
  <p> <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you base a tax on taxable surplus,
    and keep the tax proportional to taxable surplus, you levy taxes without
    twisting and inverting the landowner's or land manager's ranking of land
    uses. </span>As noted before, the owner's preferred use after tax remains
    the same as it would be without any tax. On
the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">if you
tax on some other basis</span> (Gross Revenue, for example), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">you
bias the owner
against uses more heavily taxed.</span></span> To keep the example simple, and
generally
realistic, we assume here that the seller is a "price-taker," meaning he sells
on a world market and cannot raise the price, and so has no choice but to bear
the tax. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Bear in mind that Net Revenue is the Taxable Surplus: you cannot tax more than
that without aborting the land use. The ratio of Costs (C) to Gross Revenue (G)
varies over a wide range, from zero up nearly to one (and even above one for
subeconomic uses which, however, you do not want). Let's compare two rival uses,
A and B, for the same piece of land. Use "A" yields more Net Revenue (N), but
has a higher ratio of C/G. We levy a tax of 10% on Gross Revenue (G). To simplify,
Expenses and Capital Costs are consolidated as "C", so N = G-C. Table 1 shows
the effects of the tax on Net Revenue after Tax
(NAT).</p>

  The higher use, A, produces more goods, makes more jobs, and yields more
    Net Product: it is clearly the higher use. The tax on G [Gross Revenue],
    however, turns A into a lower use than B, in the eyes of the landowner or
    manager. A 10% tax on G is a 100% tax on the N from use A, wiping out the
    entire incentive to put land to use A. It is a 40% tax on the N from use
    B, leaving 60% of the Net Product for the landowner. The landowner would
    choose use A in the absence of taxes, or with a tax on N; but the tax on
    G forces him to choose use B, which is socially inferior. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This,
    in a nutshell, expresses the damage done by imposing taxes on bases other
  than N, the Net Revenue of land. </span>    <ul>
    <li>The tax lowers output, employment, and investment opportunities for capital,
      all three. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Fourth, it lowers tax revenues well below their maximum possible level
      of $10k, the Net Revenue from use A. ... <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">read the whole article</a></li>
