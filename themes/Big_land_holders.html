  <p align="left">Land monopoly doesn't necessarily imply that just a few people
    hold all the land, though there are places in which that turns out to be
    the case. A single acre of urban land can be worth as much as 100,000 acres
    of agricultural land, and its owners are in a position to pocket incredible
    amounts of rent &#8212; which has to come from someone!</p>
  <p align="left">When rent on valuable land lodges in private pockets, or corporate
    pockets, it isn't available to support public spending -- schools, bridges,
    subways. So to pay for those things, we use income taxes and sales taxes.
    The benefits of that spending come in the form of higher property values,
    which benefit a fairly narrow class of people: those who own our best land.
    See also: <a href="Pork.html">Pork</a>!</p>
  <p align="left">We are land creatures. None of us are born with hot air balloons
    on our backs. As we currently organize our incentives and tax laws, a few
    of us are able to get rich from this particular quirk of being human. The
    alternative, of course, is to collect the annual value of the land from whomever
    has title to it, and use that as the foundation for our public spending.
    Even if it alone is not sufficient to replace all of our current taxes, why
    shouldn't it be the <em>first</em> tax we use, supplemented by less logical
    taxes only if necessary?</p>

  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,

    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose

As important as our ideas are for the justice and efficiency of
the American economy, their application is even more important in
less developed countries, where often 80% of the land is held by 3%
of the population. To give all the citizens of these countries
chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which
inevitably winds up putting land into the hands of people who cannot
use it well) but by requiring any one who uses land to pay according
to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring
this message to the world, we must first apply it to ourselves.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The rural landed
gentry. </b>Georgists have focused on urban land, stressing its
stupendous
value p.s.f., and also its high value per capita. Some have favored
ignoring rural areas completely, to placate the rural vote, and the
putative empathy of urban Americans with their rural roots, and the
supposed rural preservation of old cultural values. If those notions
ever had merit, they do not today. George himself did not think they
had merit in his day, either: his first book, <b><i>Our Land and Land
Policy</i></b> (1871) went into great detail about the villainies
(his word) involved in monopolizing rural land from the public
domain. He demolished economist Francis A. Walker while exposing how
Walker&#8217;s direction of the U.S. Census concealed the concentrated
ownership of rural land &#8211; an early example of &#8220;How to Lie
with Statistics.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the process,
George invented what today is
called the Lorenz Curve, and influenced the U.S. Census to begin
arranging data in a template geared to that curve, and to report on
land separate from buildings (which it did until 1940).</span></small></div>

<br>
<small>George
wrote little about the corporate form of organization. His modern
allies are aware that <span style="font-weight: bold;">corporations
are our major landholders. That is
a most important truth, one neglected by most other economists and
reformers. However, the Georgists are mostly content to let it go at
that. They do not see the corporate form itself as a menacing kind of
special privilege.</span> In this they are somewhat behind other reform
groups, and have, alas, little to contribute to the current debate on
this matter. They are unaware of the seminal old work by inveterate
Georgist lecturer John Z. White on the meaning of the Dartmouth
College Case decision of 1819.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><b>Weight of
excess burden of most taxes.</b> Many modern Georgists tend, oddly,
to trivialize the power of tax bias to keep land from its best use.
They have seized upon a conventional micro-economic device, now
generally called the &#8220;Harberger Triangle,&#8221; in recognition
of one Chicago-School expositor. It is based on supply and demand
curves, with no reference to land markets at all. Perhaps these
Georgists are hoping this will help them get through to ordinary
economists; but this device has the effect, by accident or design, of
minimizing estimates of the economic losses, or &#8220;excess
burdens,&#8221; that bad taxes cause. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The power of tax bias to keep land
from its best use is starkly
obvious by analyzing the economics of using marginal land. Any tax at
all will sterilize such land completely, unless the taxes are so
universal that the mobile factors, labor and capital, cannot escape
them by moving. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Who cares about marginal land?&#8221;,
some may say. The
distorting power of taxes has been demonstrated inadvertently by
Chicago-School economists Gale Johnson and Stephen Cheung. They have
shown that <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharecropping</span>, as a
private arrangement, creates a bias on
the part of tenants to substitute land for labor and equipment,
almost without limit. This is because extra land costs the cropper
nothing, unless it adds to output, so the cropper&#8217;s interest is
to substitute land, which is free to him, for his labor and capital,
which he pays for. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxes based on gross output affect
all landowners the same way the
cropshare lease affects croppers. They make every landowner a cropper
of the state, giving every landowner a motive to substitute land for
labor and capital indefinitely. Private landlords overcome this by
limiting how much land to allow each cropper; but the state has no
such offsetting control. Thus, each landowner&#8217;s motive to
acquire excess land runs wild. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In conjunction, consider that
taxes (other than property taxes)
are based solely on cash flows, thus entirely exempting all the
imputed income from and imputed consumption of the service flows of
land &#8211; the &#8220;amenities.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government
tells the landed
gentry, &#8220;Hold land as a totem, an heirloom, a private hunting
and riding park, a dream of future retirement, a speculation, a hedge
against inflation, an entry into high society, a beach access, a
protection against future neighbors, a shooting range, a golf course,
a ski hideaway, a drinking club, a private landing strip &#8230;
anything private and narcissistic or exclusionary or snobbish &#8230;
and your pleasures are tax exempt. Produce goods and services for
others, though, and we will treat you like a sharecropper &#8211; and
tax your employees, too.&#8221;</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now hark back to George&#8217;s second
force holding labor off the
better lands (Item A,3,b): <span style="font-weight: bold;">holding
land as a totem</span>. He noted that
tendency in an age before we even had an income tax, or state sales
taxes. Our present tax system magnifies the tendency beyond all
reason, resulting in the relegation of much of our best land to the
indulgences of the landed gentry, old and new.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>City and country.</b>
Few studies ever hit such a sensitive nerve as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Walter
Goldschmidt&#8217;s (1947) demonstration of the greater sociological
health and wholesomeness of Dinuba, CA, compared with nearby Arvin,
CA.</span> Dinuba is surrounded by small farms in the Alta Irrigation
District, which taxes land values. The District also taxes land
values inside the city itself. Arvin is surrounded by giant
industrial-type farms, &#8220;factories in the fields,&#8221; without
such taxes. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Goldschmidt&#8217;s prose was tedious,
melding acadamese and
bureaucratese &#8211; anything but rabble-rousing. The values he
celebrated were square and middle-class &#8211; nothing of Greenwich
Village. Yet the substance resonated radically.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The big owners sensed
a vital threat. They roared and threatened and reared up with their
political power, and &#8220;terminated with extreme prejudice&#8221;
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the agency that sponsored the
study.</span> That tells us something about its deep significance and
its
threat to the landed establishment. Goldschmidt identified a viable,
market-oriented, indigenous American alternative to gigantic,
absentee-owned industrial agriculture exploiting cheap migrant labor.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No Georgist to my knowledge has
yet drawn the Georgist morals from
this great study. Goldschmidt himself was only dimly aware of the
role of land taxation in his story. The facts are there, the
documents are there &#8230; only the scholars, so far, are missing. <a

Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, theSn it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

<blockquote>
  <p>Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his underlings
    collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
  land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated his
  net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give him
  his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald
  Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
  Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.<br>
  <br>
  Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland
  which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
  the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and Belgravia, are
  today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span><br>
  <br>
  It was a handy marriage which brought this fortune into the Grosvenor
  family&#8217;s hands &#8211; in 1677, Sir Richard Grosvenor married Mary Davies,
  heir to the hundred acres north of Piccadilly and the &#8220;Five Fields&#8221; south
  of Knightsbridge. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Mayfair and Belgravia were
  built up as residential areas for London&#8217;s wealthy classes, a position
  they have occupied ever since. Unlike many other great landowners who have
  cashed in, the Grosvenors held on and have benefited enormously from the latest
  boom
  in London property prices.<br>
  <br>
  The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His commercial property
  company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast array of investments
  and developments around the world. These include
  office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>, business
  parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>, luxury apartments
  in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
  shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>.
  In the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in Basingstoke
  and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use redevelopment in the centre
  of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair, land values are in the stratosphere:
  in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold <span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres
  of Mayfair for a cool &pound;335m.</span><br>
  <br>
  Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land value taxation,
  the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
  But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never contemplate
  selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason for not selling.
  (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&#8220;This is part of my heritage,
  my birthright. It is not to do with anything materialistic,
  but is deeply ingrained.&#8221;</span></p>
