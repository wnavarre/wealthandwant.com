<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Q: A former Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation was given a grant
      recently to research the adequacy of land as a tax base. He's a professor
      at the University of California, Riverside, named Mason Gaffney, and he
      wrote a book titled, &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; Are you familiar
      with his work?</p>
  <p>JES: No.</p>
  <p>Q: I'll send you a copy of the book. Basically, he argues that the founders
    of neo-classical economics, which, as you know, is the paradigm taught in
    schools such as the University of Chicago, distorted the science of economics
    to protect vested interests. For example, Rockefeller money was spent to
    hire professors of economics with a view to their discrediting the ideas
    of Henry George. Did that happen?</p>
  <p>JES: My general impression is that most donors that give money to universities
    don't take a very strong view of [who should be on] the faculty. Sometimes
    it ends up on one side, sometimes on the other. It would have been unusual
    [at Chicago], but it could have happened there. <strong>What is striking
    about Chicago as a school of economic theory is that it's very conservative.
    One would
    have thought that Henry George was someone who would have been liked by &quot;Conservatives.&quot;</strong></p>
  <p>Q: In that George wanted to reduce tax on the fruits of one's own labor?</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. <strong>And you want non-distortionary taxes, so I would have
      thought that every &quot;Conservative&quot; would be in Henry George's camp. Now,
    as far as I know, I'm one of the few people who keeps emphasizing that you
    ought to view Henry George in a broader way, to include natural resources.</strong>    I didn't think that people thought about that a hundred years ago. But if
    they had, and maybe Rockefeller was smart &#8212; he realized that he obviously
    didn't want a tax on natural resources.</p>
  <p>Q: He wouldn't have wanted rents flowing from natural resources to go to
    the people rather than to him.</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, he obviously wouldn't like that perspective. But I don't know
    if that view was at that time recognized, and I just don't know whether he
    actively intervened at Chicago.</p>

lunch</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Chicago School
economists insist that no free lunch exists.</span> But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <a
