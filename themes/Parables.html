  <p>In the early years of the 20th century, a Baltimore Quaker named Lizzie
    Magie developed The Landlord's Game as a way of teaching the ideas of Henry
    George. &nbsp; Most

    the 1930's, and would find the structure of The Landlord's Game very familiar. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Applying the
Theory of Justice to Land Rights Among Nations</b>
</small><br>
<small>In connecting his proposals for reform to his theory of justice,
George made the implicit assumption that all of the people to whom
the theory applies are citizens of the same nation. But it is
interesting to ask, as George did not, what his theory of justice
implies for relations among sovereign nations.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To rearrange and condense George's
axiom about natural
opportunities:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>The equal right of every human being to the use of
all that nature offers is natural, inalienable and limited only by the
equal rights of others.</small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How would acceptance of this axiom
affect relations among
nations?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To see the matter clearly, suppose
first that the world consists
of just two agricultural island nations, with equal populations but
different amounts of land of a uniform quality, and no rent
differentials arising from differences in location. Suppose further
that each island is initially governed by an oligarchy that collects
all of the rent of land and provides no public services, but leaves
the population otherwise free to produce what they choose. If the
people of this world come to an understanding that the equal right of
every human being to the use of all that nature offers is natural,
inalienable and limited only by the equal rights of others, they will
see that justice requires them to share the rent of land equally
rather than have it collected by the oligarchies.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Would they then divide the rent of
each island nation among the
people of that nation? No, they would not. From the clear meaning of
the words, the people of the nation with more land would understand
that they, as a nation, were appropriating more than their share of a
common heritage to which the people of the other nation had as much
right as they did, and that they were therefore required to
compensate the people of the other nation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider some forms that such
compensation might take. One
possibility is that everyone with exclusive use of land would divide
the rental value of his land equally among all persons. This would be
equitable, but it would have a very high transactions cost. The
conceptually simplest way to compensate for unequal appropriations of
the common heritage is to have everyone send to a clearing house the
full rental value of the land to which he has exclusive access. The
clearinghouse would then divide the proceeds equally among all
persons in both nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While this is conceptually
simplest, it entails transferring more
money than necessary. It would suffice for each person with more than
his share to send the difference between the rental value of his land
and the global average rental value per capita. This would provide a
fund that would exactly suffice to compensate every person with less
than the global average per capita amount, for the difference between
the average and his holding.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With people organized into two
nations, it would probably be
convenient to have the excess rent sent not to a global
clearinghouse, but to a national clearinghouse. The clearinghouse of
the larger nation would then send the clearinghouse of the smaller
nation an amount of money equal to the rental value of the amount of
land by which nation's area exceeded half of total land. Both
clearinghouses would then have just enough money to compensate their
citizens who had less than the global average per capita access to
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The assumptions of just two
nations, equal populations and land of
uniform quality simplify the identification of what one nation owes
the other. It is easy to dispense with these assumptions. When there
are many countries, land quality varies, and population sizes differ,
a nation is fully entitled to what it is using, taking account of the
equal entitlements of the citizen of other nations to all that nature
offers, if its average rent per capita is no greater than the global
average rent per capita. If the nation's rent per capita is greater
than this, it owes compensation equal to the excess of its aggregate
rent above the product of its population and the global average rent
per capita.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that an equal sharing of
natural opportunities does not imply
either that people derive equal satisfaction from their shares of
natural opportunities or that what constituted one person's share
will remain constant over time. If you are the only person who likes
mountain top land, you may be able to obtain a great deal of it as
your share of what nature offers, and be much more satisfied than
those who like land in valleys and have to compete with many others
who want valley land. If mountain top land becomes more popular, the
amount that constitutes your share will decline.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now suppose that nations are not
entirely agricultural, but have
cities as well as agricultural areas. Cities have streets, water
systems, sewer systems, and a variety of other public services that
raise the rental value of land. How does this additional source of
rent affect the compensation process? Recall the principle:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The equal right of every
human being to the use of all that nature offers is natural,
inalienable and limited only by the equal rights of others.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Streets, water systems, sewer
systems, and other public services
are not offered by nature. The additions to the rental value of land
that these services provide are the product of the human effort that
goes into creating and sustaining them. Thus the increases in the
rental value of land that arise from them are not part of what must,
by the application of our axiom, be shared among nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This distinction between rent to
which all persons have equal
rights and rent that is properly the income of a particular community
creates a problem of assessment. To fulfill their obligations to
people in rest of the world, the people of a city must know what the
rental value of the land they occupy would be if the city were not
there. How can they know this?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This assessment problem is
formidable, but not a reason to abandon
the effort to achieve equal rights to natural opportunities. In
principle, the pre-development value of the land beneath a city is
the difference between the rental value of the land when developed
optimally and the annual cost of that development. One might call
upon city planners or the developers of new towns to make such
estimates. Even if we could not achieve complete precision in such
estimates, we might achieve substantial agreement. It would be a
great step in the direction of equal rights to natural opportunities
if each nation were to make a declaration of the form, "This is what
we believe to be the pre-development value of our land, and of the
land in the rest of the world, and this is the basis for our
belief."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What has been established so far
is that adherence to a principle
of equal rights to natural opportunities requires payments among
nations to offset inequalities in the value of natural opportunities
per capita, that natural opportunities are exemplified by the
pre-development rental value of land, that significant difficulties
can be expected in identifying these pre-development rental values,
and that such difficulties are not a sufficient reason to abandon all
efforts to identify the pre-development rental value of land....&nbsp; <a
