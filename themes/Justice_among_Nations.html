  <p>How are we to live justly and peaceably with the other nations in the world?</p>

      Global Economic Justice</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">      </span>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons
of development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people think of preventing
grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I. The Functions
of a Theory of Justice</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the use of a theory of
justice? A theory is an
abstraction. By itself, it can't make anything happen. But when a
theory of justice takes root in us, it modulates our emotional
responses to distributive outcomes. If you should come to realize
that the theory of justice to which you subscribe says that something
you thought you wanted to do is unjust, you will find that course of
action no longer so appealing. If you come to a new realization that
justice is on your side, you are likely to feel emboldened and ready
to persist despite obstructions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If you should come to the
realization that justice requires of you
a course of action that you had not planned on, you will feel a pull
in that direction, and if you do not follow through, you are likely
to feel guilty. If your theory of justice informs you that another
person is treated unjustly, even a stranger, you are likely to feel
compassion for that person, and you may also feel a chivalrous
impulse to take up that person's cause and seek redress of the
injustice. It was because of feelings of injustice that slavery was
abolished and women were granted the right to vote.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As
the world shrinks, nations impinge upon one another in more and
more ways, providing applications for a theory of justice among
nations. </span>The fishing that one nation does leaves fewer fish in
the
oceans for others. When a river flows from one nation into another,
the removal of water by the upstream nation leaves less water for the
downstream nation. Near the borders of nations, the use of a
frequency by one nation for radio or TV broadcasting precludes its
use by the other. Geo-synchronous parking spaces for communications
satellites are scarce. Air-borne and water-borne pollutants cross
international borders and cause harm. The burning of fossil fuel
produces global warming at rates and with consequences that are not
yet understood. Chlorofluorocarbons emitted in the Northern
Hemisphere enlarge the Antarctic ozone hole and cause skin cancer in
Australia.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
most of these areas, the awareness of our global
interdependence has led to some agreements among nations. But
agreement is not always reached. </span>Negotiations are intricate and
time-consuming. Sometimes key participants refuse to accept what is
agreeable to others. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A shared theory
of justice among nations would
point the way to agreement and shame those who refused to accept the
result.</span> I will argue that a theory of justice inspired by Henry
George provides a simple and far-reaching framework for specifying
the requirements of justice among nations and within nations.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Applying the
Theory of Justice to Land Rights Among Nations</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In connecting his proposals for
reform to his theory of justice,
George made the implicit assumption that all of the people to whom
the theory applies are citizens of the same nation. But it is
interesting to ask, as George did not, what his theory of justice
implies for relations among sovereign nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To rearrange and condense George's
axiom about natural
opportunities:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>The equal right of every human being to the use of
all that nature offers is natural, inalienable and limited only by the
equal rights of others.</small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How would acceptance of this axiom
affect relations among
nations? <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Differences in
Ability and in Wealth</b>
</small><br>
<small>Suppose that a nation appropriates only its share of natural
opportunities but is richer than other nations because its citizens
are on average harder working or more highly talented than the
citizens of other nations are. Does justice require the richer nation
to compensate the others? By this theory of social justice,
definitely not! Each person has an exclusive right to his or her
productive powers. Therefore the nation as a whole has a right to the
product of its citizens' talents, no matter how greatly this product
exceeds that of the citizens of other nations. The citizens of a rich
nation may feel compassion for those who are poorer than themselves,
and therefore contribute to poor nations as a matter of charity, but
justice does not compel them to do so.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What about greater incomes that
arise from greater wealth? These
require more elaborate analysis. When greater wealth is the result of
greater saving from the product of talent or from the product of a
nation's share of natural opportunities, then a nation with greater
wealth is fully entitled to the greater income that comes from it.
However, when greater wealth is the result of a history of theft or
of unjustifiably large appropriations from the natural opportunities
that are everyone's common heritage, then the nation that possesses
that wealth cannot rightly claim either the income from the wealth or
the wealth itself. To achieve justice, the wrongful appropriations
must be rectified. The unjustly acquired wealth must be restored from
those from whom it was taken, or if that is not possible, shared
among all nations. To the extent that persons who are still alive
received past income from this wealth, that income must be
disgorged. ...</small><small>&nbsp; <a
