  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>The Possibility of Land (Rent) Taxation</strong></p>
  <p>The key to understanding how taxing various forms of land conform to sound
    tax theory comes with an appreciation of the importance of economic rent.
    Largely discarded in 20th century economic analysis, rent is the price for
    the use of land. Just as the price of labor is paid in wages and the price
    of capital is paid in interest, land rent is the unearned increment that
    attaches to land in the form of a surplus when its price is not paid by its
    users. All taxes, ultimately, come out of rent; however, by collecting revenue
    from other sources, the rent is left to settle in ever increasing encrustations
    on land sites, i.e., capitalized, ultimately raising their market price.
    In so doing, these land prices are distorted so that their optimal use is
    not secured.</p>
  <p>Examples of such distortion are not difficult to identify. Consider, first
    of all, the use of locations in our urban environments, many of which are
    underused while prospective entrepreneurs are driven to second-best locations
    because titleholders opt to let the rent accrete and passively raise their
    market price. Land speculation is rife most of all in instances where there
    is a great disparity between the tax rate on these sites and the rate of
    rent appreciation. When the holding costs of ownership are nominal, there
    is no incentive for improving them or selling to others who will, and urban
    environments suffer as a result. Another example is rent that collects to
    the electromagnetic spectrum, making it attractive for owners of electronic
    media, communications networks and so on, to rely on returns to their investments
    even when the resource itself is sparsely used. <strong>So also with the
    time slots for take-offs and landings at airports. These opportunities are
    respected
    as private property, even while they gain in market value in response to
    the general traffic volume of the facility. This occurs regardless whether
    the particular airlines use their slots or not. London Mayor Ken Livingstone
    has proposed to tax the rent from Heathrow and Gatwick both for their revenue
    advantage and to assure their more optimal use.</strong><font size="-1"><strong><em>[7]</em></strong></font> One
    could go on, pointing to any number of instances where economic rent is available
    to be had for the support of public services in lieu of conventional taxes
    which we recognize as destructive in their effects.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font> It
    is not surprising that when pressed even conventional (neoclassical) economists
    are often willing to concede that the best possible tax of all is one placed
    on land rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

 href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
      of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
      Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
      Population, and Economic Growth </a><b>    </b>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>III. Applications
to Congestion</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The logic of efficient
environmental protection applies with few
changes to issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple
example of the application of land value taxation to solving a
problem of congestion. If there is a shortage of parking places (at a
zero price) then the introduction of parking meters (charging rent
for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the price of
a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and
demand at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking
only where the revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the
value of the additional lane in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few
years we will have parking meters with prices that vary by time of
day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime, we get by
with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the day
when demand is greatest.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charging rent for parking is only
a small step from charging rent
for cars that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on
the streets, the slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having
one more car on the streets is the value of the extra travel time
that everyone else endures because of the one additional car. In many
places, the congestion cost of traffic is less than the cost of
administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not the case
everywhere. <b>William Vickrey</b> used to say that his estimate of
the cost in additional delays of having one more car in midtown
Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour. He
would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be
charged $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan.
He had estimated marginal cost at the present level of usage. The
efficient charge -- perhaps $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the
streets so greatly that the marginal congestion cost of street usage
would equal the price. Efficient congestion prices for using the
streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities) would not
merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special
charges for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal
way that created congestion. If we could keep track of the movements
of vehicles, then for any vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up
vehicles that wanted to move, there would be a charge for the
resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high. Companies
making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the
day. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Congestion charges also apply
to bottlenecks such as bridges
and tunnels.</b> Whenever such a facility has cars backed up seeking
to use it, efficiency is improved by applying a toll that reduces
demand to capacity. The same output is produced, revenue is
generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The efficiency of congestion
pricing would also apply to such
public facilities as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to
have more take-offs and landings than an airport can accommodate, it
is efficient and just to allocate take-off and landing slots by
price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest of airlines, has
prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead to
allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Central Park in New York, there
are fewer baseball fields than
are demanded at a zero price. There is a private company that has the
right and responsibility to organize the leagues that are allowed to
use the fields. This company is able to charge fees that implicitly
include the scarcity value of the fields. A recognition that the
parks are the common heritage of everyone in the city would lead
instead to a charge for using the ball fields that equated supply and
demand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are also applications of
congestion prices at an
international level. For example, <b>there may be congestion in
geosynchronous orbits for satellites</b>. If this should occur, then
the just thing to do is to charge market-clearing rents for
geo-synchronous orbits and share the proceeds among all nations in
proportion to their populations.&nbsp; </small><small><b>... </b><span
