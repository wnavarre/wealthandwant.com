<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The property tax as most of us know it is two very different
    taxes rolled into one.&nbsp; The two parts of it have very different effects, but since
    we traditionally set a single millage rate for both of them, we get very
    peculiar and undesirable effects.&nbsp; The portion of the tax that falls
    on buildings and their contents -- manmade improvements to the property --
    have one set
    of effects, mostly undesirable.&nbsp; The portion of the tax that falls on
    land -- site values -- has a very different set of effects, and they are
    highly desirable ones from nearly every standpoint.&nbsp; When both tax rates
    go up, or both are capped and unevenly distributed as they are in California,
    strange and undesirable things
    happen.</p>
  <p align="left">Pennsylvania has the enabling legislation to use a higher millage
    rate on land than on buildings, and its use has produced some very good effects.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public need to be
    awakened to the central role played by taxation. They need to see that loss
    of our historic land tax has made speculation our top national sport -- a
    treacherous one at that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
    Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect Paul
    Spreiregen):</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>There is no doubt that the present real
    property tax...contributes more to depressing the standard of housing than
    all government housing policies combined do to raise it. The current property
    tax may fairly be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land values too lightly,
    buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use, penalizes good land
    use. Consider three identical homes and lots: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec room, new
        roof, great landscaping.</span> The assessor comes by and says, in effect: "As
        punishment for making a showplace, and for generating jobs and profits
        for local businesses, we're raising your assessment by the amount of
        your investments. Your tax bill will go up, not just for a year, but
        for as long as you keep the house in good condition."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his house of the
        same size run down -- loose banisters, torn screens, broken gutters,
        junk-filled yard. </span>The assessor tells him, in effect: "Because
        you created an eyesore for your neighbors and an unsafe dwelling for
        your tenants, we're reducing your assessment and your taxes. If your
        place is more dilapidated next year, we'll reduce them even more."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his building
        down; the idle lot neither houses nor employs anybody.</span> The friendly
        assessor tells him, in effect: "For completely wasting your property,
        and for making no use of the infrastructure provided for this area, we'll
        give you the lowest assessment and tax bill of the three." </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples condemn
    not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same perverse property
    tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it any wonder cities are
    torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only the half of it. The low
    land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees that the annual increase in his
    or her land value is greater than the tax bill. This signals the owner to
    do nothing, to sit back and collect the values generated by productive neighbors
    and the community.</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
    feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter the supply of
    available sites.</span> This raises land prices further, seducing more speculators
    into the land game, hastening the flight of residents and businesses from
    central cities and even small towns. This is far from the only cause of sprawl,
    but one of the most potent. It cannot be stressed too much because it is
    one of the least recognized causes.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>If we continue on our present course, overtaxing production and undertaxing
  land, the outlook is dismal. It is heading us toward the very conditions seen
  in extreme forms in Latin America and other continents.</small> <br>

</span>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any one thing
    and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on the property
    tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss, political favoritism,
    and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood tenure. Echoing Thoreau,
    the more familiar reforms have failed to address this many-headed hydra at
    its root. To think that the root could be chopped by a mere shift in the
    property tax base -- from buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome
    of unfounded faith. Yet the evidence shows that state and local tax activists
    do have a powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
    efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the site's
    full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land is a lower
    or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... </strong><br>
  <br>
  <font size="3"><small>In PTS, the T stands for tax. Taxes, at best, are grudgingly
  accepted as "the price of civilization". The property tax, a threat to home
  ownership, is roundly disliked. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rather than recognize the two different taxes rolled
  up in the property tax, most reformers and most electorates simply choose to
  cap the property tax rate (and thereby inflate the price of land).</span> To
  parry the anti-tax fervor, it is possible to rename the proposal as a "sprawl
  tax" (as does Alan Thein Durning in <i>Tax Shift). </i>This name suggests the
  new charge would counter a negative condition. It's also possible to formulate
  the proposal as a user fee. A jurisdiction could raise the fee for deeds and
  collect it annually, as states do for titles to vehicles, and thereby technically
  avoid being a tax.<br>
  <br>
  The proposal is often seen as a tax on land, on one's private property, the
  under girding of one's home, "everyman's castle." The associations with land<b> </b>are
  so positive, and the connotations of tax are so negative, that the proposal
  feels to the public like a threat to one's own niche in the universe. One way
  to try to defuse this emotional reaction is to replace "land" with terms such
  as "site" and "location."&nbsp; Also, proponents can insert the word "value" which
  is not only more accurate, it's also more abstract, softening the emotional
  blow.<br>
  <br>
  People prefer "the devil they know."&nbsp; People may not like their tax burden,
  but they sure don't want to risk letting it go any higher. Yet the proposal
  is to increase the land tax rate or deed fee. Plus, a levy on site value, in
  the many growing jurisdictions, constitutes a higher charge on something growing
  -- site values. To prevent "inflating residents out of their homes", the proposal
  could either <br>
  </small></font></small>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>(a) exempt the
            first $20,000 or so of site value, ensuring that the poorest landowners
            pay at most a modicum, or <br>
    (b) rebate some rent (collected site value) once some threshold is reached,
    say when the land dues owed by the poorest quintile equal, say, 5% of average
    local income. (The actual trigger figure needs more thorough calculating.) </small></font><br>
    </small></div>
    <small><font size="3"><small>PTS proponents could present their proposal
    as an even lower cap on improvements, down even to zero, with an equivalent
    quasi-cap on locations, above which any surplus collected rent would automatically
    be rebated to residents on a per capita basis. This higher rate on land may
    be made even more sellable than a lower one were the PTS hitched to a reduction
    of taxes on income or sales, too.<br>
  <br>
  The PTS is social engineering, an attempt to manipulate behavior. Yet all taxes
  spur a different response from taxpayers. Hence legislators offer credits,
  deductions, exemptions, deferments, abatements, and assess property at current
  use versus market value. Which is the real distortion of free choice? The present
  practice of privatizing publicly-generated land values or the proposed policy
  of sharing rent while respecting earnings?</small></font><strong> ...</strong><br>
  <br>
  <font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS would replace is the present
  property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on land and another on
  improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes owners for improving. This
  negative incentive does its greatest damage at the margin, where profit is
  slim. There, rather than pay a higher tax, owners let buildings dilapidate
  into slums. The lack of much tax on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable.
  This negative incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold
  them from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.<br>
  <br>
  Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land. Leap-frog development
  raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up values everywhere,
  increasing the property tax burden of owners of previously developed sites,
  unless the tax is capped. The resultant sprawl also raises enormously the cost
  of extending infrastructure and makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
  <br>
  The PTS reverses all these negative consequences. </small></font></small>
    <ul>
      <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than burden construction, taxing
              only land spares it. </small></font></small></li>
      <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread development (hooking
              us on cars), taxing land concentrates it (providing a market for
              mass transit). </small></font></small></li>
      <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than inflate land price, a land
              tax squashes it. </small></font></small></li>
      <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of prime
              sites or itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected
              site rent as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher,
              making home ownership inflation-proof.<strong> ... </strong> </small></font></small></li>
    </ul>
    <small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in
    turn needs a matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating
    that we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax earnings
    -- does just that. </small></font><a

Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Without spending a penny of subsidy,
    cities can make urban renewal more profitable than suburban development.
    How is about as commonsensical as Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
    it works. The trick is to forget subsidies and lower one tax while raising
    another. That is, levy a tax or charge a fee to collect land value while
    eliminating any tax on buildings or improvements. </small><br>
  <small>&nbsp; </small><br>
  <small> The present property tax works backwards, like an intruder from the
  anti-universe. It increases as owners improve their property; it decreases
  when owners let buildings dilapidate. "Save money, create slums," cities tell
  owners. ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> The world looks different to owners dozing at the wheel, waiting for
  land values to rise. Title-holders keeping prime downtown sites vastly underutilized "now
  pay only, say, $25,000 per year in property tax for a half block," figures <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Dr.
  Mason Gaffney</a> of the University of California at Riverside. "Post-PTS (property
  tax shift), these owners of parking lots and abandoned warehouses might have
  to part with three times that amount each year." At $75,000 per annum, no longer
  could they afford to let prime sites lie relatively idle. "They'll put their
  land to uses that generate much more revenue than does an empty building or
  car-covered lot," adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy building apartments, stores,
  offices, schools, theaters, mixing all uses together to maximize their return."&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html"><big><big><small><small><span

Tony Vickers: <a href="../docs/Vickers_Zee_Vee.html">From Zee to Vee:
using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Nobel-winning economist William Vickrey
    said that the property tax is actually two different taxes (Vickrey 1991).
    That is because buildings are capital, not land, in the economic sense &#8211; even
    if, in most legal codes, there is no distinction between land and improvements
    made to it which are all lumped together as &#8216;landed property&#8217; or
    real estate. Buildings and other improvements to land all depreciate over
    time unless further capital is expended. Eventually the market value of such <i>improvements</i> may
    become negative, owing to the costs that would need to be incurred by someone
    wishing to redevelop the site for an alternative use. But that does not necessarily
    take away the rental value of the <i>site</i>. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much urban blight is caused by these so-called &#8216;brown
    field&#8217; vacant and under-used sites. However they are often in valuable
    locations, with good transport connections. It may be that owners are speculating
    that land prices will rise and enable them to sell at greater profit in the
    future than now, or it may be that there is genuinely no market for sites
    in a particular location unless the cost of remediation is subsidised as
    a form of public investment. Such investment, according to Vickrey and other
    followers of Henry George, can be entirely funded from LVT. In a lecture
    given in 1991, first published last year, Vickrey claimed:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;Cities have the capacity
      to be fully self-financing without dependence on either federal assistance
      or on general taxes that are unrelated to benefits received.&#8221;</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proviso, according to Vickrey, is to
    replace the tax on buildings with a tax on land value alone &#8211; LVT:-</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;The property tax combines
      one of the best and one of the worst taxes we have. The portion that falls
      on sites or land values is the only major tax that is reasonably free of
      distortionary effects and is not intolerably regressive&#8221;.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing buildings and work done to improve
    them discourages such work. Un-taxing them and taxing land more highly, irrespective
    of its actual state of development but based upon its <i>highest and best
    immediate potential use</i>, will encourage owners to maintain their sites
    and buildings in such a way as to maximise their income. <i>A remote site
    or one with conservation or other restrictions will have a low site value,
    hence attract low taxes, whereas a high value city centre derelict site will
    very soon be redeveloped.</i> The extra property tax revenue from extending
    the tax base to sites that are currently under-taxed (because the tax is
    based primarily on building/rental value not site/owner value), ensures public
    infrastructure projects can be funded without resource to general taxes or
    excessive borrowing on the financial markets.&nbsp; <span

Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a> (circa 1964)<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html"><br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of my talk is to show that the
      relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack of economic growth
      is that of cause to effect.</span> I shall try to explain why I believe
      that property taxation is one of the two chief villains in the drama we
      are witnessing today in these United States. The other villain is the monetary
      policy pursued by the government, which has increased the cost of borrowing
      to a point where it stifles the growth of the economy. In this context
      however I shall be concerned only with property taxation.<strong> ... </strong><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect of our
  property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a premium on obsolescence
  and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
  valorem</span> taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
  depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners of old
  and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly constructed
  buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span> ... <br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of the tax that
  is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population, immigration from the farms
  and other forces have led to a rapid increase in the population of our large
  cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population pressure is
  bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate system of land taxation
  could have prevented the steep rise in urban land values.</span><br>
  <br>
  Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are capitalized.
  For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have an imputed or expected
  income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad
  valorem" tax would reduce the imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax
  would naturally reduce the value of the land by the same percentage. <br>
  <br>
  For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by taxing land
  at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have increased tremendously during
  recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the assessed value
  of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002 millions in 1962,
  an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The assessed values, are supposed
  to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values during
  this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even this figure
  is an understatement because it is based on assessed values and land is greatly
  underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land values have
  risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land averaged about 1.5%.
  Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land would have earned about 8
  1/2% per year just by withholding land from its proper use.</span> <strong>... </strong><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
  <br>
  </span>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that has
  taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep rise
  in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
  tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of more and
  better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has been too low
  to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental properties.</span><br>
  <br>
  Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. </small>
    <ul>
      <li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes on
          land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
          rate. </small></li>
      <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are low,
          our cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
          metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <small>Relatively low taxes on land and high taxes on improvements will discourage
    the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as that used for parking
    lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from improving their land. It
    will encourage them to keep the land out of use and to sell later at a profit.
    This will create an artificial shortage of land, which in turn will lead
    to urban blight and irregular, leapfrog city growth.<br>
  <br>
  This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many disadvantages
  besides:</small>
    <ul>
      <li><small>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land; </small></li>
      <li><small>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really needed; </small></li>
      <li><small>the building developer has to go far out to find available land; </small></li>
      <li><small>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther; </small></li>
      <li><small>traffic on congested roads will increase and </small></li>
      <li><small>new roads and schools will have to be built.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is generally believed that zoning
    laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities. Zoning
    laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody can be forced
    to improve his land and to build unless there is an incentive. This can be
    achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make it unprofitable to hold
    it without improving it.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
  <br>
  The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning laws. With both
  these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but -- as experience
  has shown -- without land taxation rational and efficient land usage becomes
  impossible.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
  </span>The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be desired.
  Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous, arbitrary
  and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full market or cash
  value. In many states no public records are available indicating assessed values
  and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his tax bill will be.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the administration
  of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and enormous underassessment
  of land. A survey made recently found that in 9 California counties, vacant
  lots and acreage were assessed at only 5.3% of the cash value, while residential
  property was assessed at 19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of
  land deprives local governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover,
  it further aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of property taxation
  on improvements as distinguished from those caused by the incidence of these
  taxes on land. </span></small>
    <ul>
      <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on improvements
          will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
          home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. </small></li>
      <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not identical
          effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
          will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
          home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property taxation
    consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same results
    as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on improvements produce
    the same results as lower rates on land. </span><small><small><big><big><a style="font-weight: bold;"

    Just
Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Rent in Cities</strong></p>
  <p>The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the economic
      rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes to settle
      on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market price of
      sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced ground rent
      in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect on sites but could
      be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the services that cities are
      bound to perform. As will be evident below, the amount of economic rent available
      for recovery is thought sufficient to pay for all services and then some. Today
      it simply collects on sites of greatest activity with typical and visible negative
      consequences.</p>
  <p>One might suppose that collecting the economic rent would leave locational
      sites with less market price appreciation, stabilizing land prices at levels
      that are more within reach for various developments. To be sure collecting
      economic rent exerts a downward pressure on market prices. But there is a countervailing
      pressure that works to neutralize whatever tendencies are otherwise at work:
      the collection of rent, especially from high-value sites, increases the carrying
      costs in ways that provides a greater inducement for their titleholders to
      improve them. That incentive fosters development in areas that, together in
      combination with other activity generated in neighborhoods, tends to maintain
      the stability of land markets in a roughly constant pattern.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Unfortunately the positive effect of taxing rent in the typical American city
        is neutralized by the fact that taxes are also imposed upon improvements. Even
        though taxing land sites fosters their more intensive use, taxing buildings
        exerts a penalty on titleholders for doing so that works in the opposite direction.
        The conventional tax on real property in most American cities is like a train
        with an engine at each end. Whatever beneficial effects that might be apparent
        by taxing just land value are taken away again by the tax on improvements.
        This is why so many cities suffer from abandonment and despoliation. It is
        also why titleholders so often revile the conventional property tax. Were the
        tax on improvements gradually phased out and the tax on land values raised
        proportionately in a revenue-neutral manner, underused parcel owners would
        be induced to make improvements and sites would be built upon commensurate
        with their market price.<font size="-1"><em>[12]</em></font> This
        practice is increasingly employed by municipalities both in the US and beyond.</strong><font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxing land value only is an incentive with the virtue of reversing the centrifugal
        forces of sprawl development and the tendency for builders to choose suboptimal
        locations.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Some titleholders
        find it advantageous to hold their valuable parcels off the market for speculative
        gain. But bringing the holding costs forward rather than allowing their exploitation
        for a capital gain upon sale increases the market efficiency of transactions
        and more optimal use of sites. The incentive to speculate on others' dime is
        removed.</p>
  <p>Cities, having the huge preponderance of land value, stand most to gain
          by a shift of taxes to land value alone. If they wished they could &quot;cream&quot; the
        tax base in a way that would make outermost locations positively jealous.
          Contrary to the thesis of writers like David Rusk who argue for incorporating
          the suburbs
        to the cities to expand the tax base,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> it
        is the urban cores that have the greatest tax base in the form of high
        ground rent. Preliminary studies indicate that the amount of economic
        rent available
        to be recovered in taxes is equivalent to the optimal demand for services
        that cities require. Nobel prize winning economists William Vickrey and
        Joseph Stiglitz
        have been among those who explored what is known as the Henry George
        Theorem.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16] </em></strong></font>Given
        the quality of current data it remains a challenge to be more specific
        in applications of this thesis. It remains a subject area begging for
        further exploration. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

                                                  <small>In a now familiar sequence, developers reach for the cheapest land,
                                                  out in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in behind with brand
                                                  new infrastructure roads, sewerage systems and schools paid for in part
                                                  by those
                                                  whose existing roads and schools are left to decline. Property values rise
                                                  in a ring that marches steadily outward from the city and fall in older
                                                  suburbs inside the moving edge. Because residential development can't meet

                                                  that deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise, providing

Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most compelling arguments to many
    supporters stem from its environmental consequences. A tax on land sites
    is the most powerful instrument available to neutralize and reverse the centrifugal
    forces of urban sprawl. This is because incentives are present &#8212; the
    higher the tax the more power it has &#8212; to improve the high-value sites
    to the full extent that their market value warrants. Titleholders are induced
    to build on their parcels in order to recover the carrying costs of their
    increased taxes. The inelastic supply of land sites means that taxes are
    shouldered fully by owners, without being passed on to tenants. (Of course
    a tenant&#8217;s charges can be raised anytime.) Hence urban areas tend to
    be improved and peripheral areas become less attractive to sprawl development.
    George saw a strong moral argument for shifting from the conventional property
    tax levied on both land and improvements to one based on land alone. The
    argument was quite simple:<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the tax as it stood penalized people who improved
    their property and rewarded people who held vacant parcels for speculative
    gain. It rewarded those owners who let their holdings go to wrack and ruin,
    often those who bought up parcels to use as rental property without investing
    in the maintenance to ensure that they would continue to be attractive and
    livable &#8212; slumlords.</span> ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The counterpart
      of sharing rent through taxation is to untax things, like buildings, that
      involve human endeavor.</span> This doubles the incentive effect. If land
      tax is the stick, untaxing buildings is the corresponding carrot, and George's
      program makes both larger. Every lot with an old "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Defender</span>" building
      has a potential replacement, the "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Challenger</span>." Taxing
      buildings rigs the fight against the Challenger. Say the lot-cum-Defender
      is worth $100K, and the Challenger would cost $500K to build. Challenger
      cash flow must exceed Defender cash flow by enough to pay $500K, plus added
      taxes based on it. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax, by contrast, is impartial
    between Defender and Challenger; the market decides. In 1965, after a detailed
    Milwaukee study, I found that switching to the George program would allow
    30% of the city to be renewed immediately, simply by untaxing Challengers
    vis-a-vis Defenders. (Sadly, Mayor Maier went the other way, so Milwaukee
    lost 20% of its people and much of its wealth.)&nbsp; <span

TRED (Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development): <a

USA</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... As the reader goes through these collected
    papers he will, I&nbsp;am certain, find himself saying (even as I did) that
    the taxation heritage of the United States -- based on sound democratic principles
    -- has been permitted to become heavily encrusted with an overlay of special-interest
    legislation. It is time these accretions were scraped off so that the clean
    lines of the original may be seen. When the original purposes and methods
    of reaching them are revealed, the property tax becomes much more attractive
    to businessmen, to economists, to tax specialists, and -- most important
    of all -- to taxpayers in general.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The property tax was developed as a general,
    state-wide tax, and its evolution into a special district and municipal tax
    was most unfortunate and requires remedy. In the United States, the property
    tax just does not possess great, unique advantages as a revenue e source
    within a small geographical area. Actually, many of the small, independent
    property-taxing jurisdictions are not required for effective local control
    of government, but are an example of property-tax encrustation through special-interest
    legislation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before the days of the income tax, the property
    tax was aimed at ability to pay, and many of its current shortcomings arose
    from efforts to reach income directly. This effort is no longer required.
    The development of the income tax as the major revenue source of the federal
    government and the emergence of the federal government as the nation's major
    tax-gatherer -- plus the wide use of the income tax by state and local governments
    -- have largely eliminated the original need to justify the property tax
    by attempting to base it on ability to pay. Individual justice could now
    be attained if the property tax were based on cost of benefits enjoyed by
    the property. Social justice could be achieved if the tax took into account
    society's general expansion in numbers and productivity. Recognition of the
    property tax's strength in helping society to benefit generally from the
    land and resource values it is creating seems currently to be growing.&nbsp; </small><small>... <a
