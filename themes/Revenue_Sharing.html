Sharing</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>A great deal of revenue sharing goes on in the U.S. now, generally flowing
    from higher-rent states to lower-rent states. Were we to start taxing land
    value properly, the same thing would happen: the extremely high land values
    in our largest cities would be collected and used to support spending, including
    education, in much lower-rent places. Currently, only a small amount of the
    economic rent of, for example, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles
    is collected. The rest lines the pockets of individuals, family trusts and
    the shareholders of corporations and real estate investment trusts, and contributes
    mightily to our amazing concentration of wealth in a small segment of the
    U.S. population.</p>
  <p>When one stops to think about the huge amount of land rent that exists in
    New York City, it is particularly shocking that NYC's public schools aren't
    the showpieces of American society.</p>

    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value, how
    would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public needs?</em><br>
    A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
    values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth,
    are not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values
    of the state at large.</p>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would be still
    further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The current trend toward
returning functions to the states is a step in the right direction. But
it encounters understandable objections that poor states cannot afford
to do what they ought to do. Some form of revenue sharing is needed.
But it is important to have the right definition of which states are
rich and which are poor. The level of well-being in a state is
determined in part by the wisdom of its public policies. States should
not be penalized for adopting productive policies. Revenue sharing
should equalize per capita levels of natural opportunities (mineral
revenues, fishing rights, pre-development land rents, etc.) Replacing
the personal and corporate income taxes with either a flat income tax
or a national sales or value added tax would greatly reduce the excess
burden of federal taxes. (Excess burden is roughly proportional to the
square of the typical marginal tax rate.) But almost all the gains go
to the rich. Perhaps the flat tax could be combined with a guaranteed
income.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even better than a flat tax or a national sales tax, in my view,
would be a return to the revenue system that was apparently envisioned
by the drafters of the Constitution in 1787. I mean a rule that the
federal revenue requirement would be allocated to the states in
proportion to their populations. The use of population as the
allocation device seems anachronistic in this era of concern for
impoverished regions. But the allocation could be corrected by an
expenditure that equalized per capita access to natural opportunities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I see three important virtues in allocating the revenue
obligation to the states.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it gets rid of the IRS and its intrusions. (A
national sales or value added tax would do most of this, leaving only
firms subject to the tax man's scrutiny.)</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, it requires the states to compete in seeking ways
of raising revenue that do not reduce the productivity of their
economies. The competitive equilibrium is to raise as much revenue as
possible from charges for exclusive use of land and other natural
opportunities, and to tax labor and capital only as a last resort.</small></li>
  <li><small>The third virtue is the likelihood that placing the
revenue obligation on states rather than on individuals would lead to
more careful scrutiny of the value of proposed expenditures.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With only fifty states and each
state aware of exactly how much each spending proposal will cost its
treasury, I believe that it would be much harder to secure approval for
inefficient or special-interest spending. <span

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Revenue_Sharing.html">Revenue
Sharing under Land Value Taxation</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proposition that the rental
value of land should be collected by
governments and used for public purposes has a powerful moral
rationale: Since no one made the land, no one can properly claim to own
it. There is a simple efficiency rationale as well: Social collection
of the rental value of land does not interfere with incentives to be
productive. If governments do not collect the rental value of land,
then they will levy taxes that discourage productive activity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When "government" is not a monolith but a collection of entities
with
responsibilities in different geographic and functional areas, these
rationales for land value taxation leave unanswered the question of how
the rental value of land should be allocated among governments. That
question is addressed in this paper.</small>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me therefore that we need
    to face up to the question that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
    Federalism, that is, how is money going to be distributed by the federal
    government out of its so-called surplus, either to people or the States,
    or localities? ... </span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>The reason it's so hard to
  sell growth policies at the local level today in the United States is very
  much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he United States
  federal government taxes people and it gives subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to
  landlords. So the landlords can get the subventions without having the people.
  So who needs people?</span> That's it in a nutshell. We need to reverse that,
  I think, if we're going to be able to make Georgism work at the local level.
  ... </small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between the
  federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both countries we find
  something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which means that the senior governments
  send money to the junior governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
  balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the poorer governments,
  those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than to richer ones. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> <strong>&nbsp;...</strong> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's
  Law</span>. ... But the general idea is, you may think you have tenure control
  of land but if the municipal government can tax that land and use that money
  to finance public welfare services, public education and other things that
  are open to all comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution
  of population. ... </small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> At the same time, in both countries you find something I will call <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammer's
  Law</span>. This is not a carpenter's tool but again the name of a man, an
  economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that if you compared population
  to land values in the different counties of his State (in the very poor counties
  of the Ozarks the land was hard scrabble land of very little value, with the
  very rich lands in the northwestern part of the State, which resembles Iowa)
  you found that the population density was much greater on the very poor land
  of the Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest. ... </small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> Now another similarity to the two countries us that the subventions
  that do go from the federal government to the provinces in Canada (and you
  find a similar thing in the United States) do not come from the richer provinces.
  They come instead from the general fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is
  in other words more vertical balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal
  balancing you remember means equalization among the different jurisdictions).</b> It's
  a little like what somebody said about foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device
  by which poor people in rich countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in
  poor countries.'</small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something like
  that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation, there's a
  tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the property tax are
  being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose Ferdinand Marcos would
  be a splendid example of the kind of person I was talking about in the poor
  country and in West Virginia you have all these coal companies whose owners
  live in Palm Beach, whose shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places,
  who benefit from an inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well
  these are similarities.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
  <small> </small><br>
  <small> The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the United
  States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes to have his fingerprint,
  as they say, on every dollar that goes from Washington. ... So in the States
  the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their population and then
  give the money back according to political power.</b> In the United States
  Senate it means that the smallest State has just as much clout as the biggest
  State or would have if their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in
  California when we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places
  for a Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
  But that's another story.) <strong>...</strong></small><small> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful distinction about
      Canadians is the strong and explicit recognition among almost everyone,
      even if he's an economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
      endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span> <b>Equalisation
      in Canadian politics means sharing the economic rent.</b> Everybody talks
      that way. Canadian economists even when they come to the States talk that
      way. Just as though rent were a permissible word in polite discourse. It's
      very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However there's a very selective attitude
      towards rent -- towards what rents are shareable, I should say.</span> </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Forest revenues are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Water power is fair game. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents that are generated
      by the valuable lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big
      and powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair game.</i></b> As a
      matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print of the equalization
      law, which I did on the airplane, you find the most interesting exception
      to what's included in the formula. I'll explain the formula to you in a
      moment if you are still awake. ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let's look at the sharing formula. <b>The
      sharing formula in Canada is essentially based on population and potential
      tax base.</b> And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've
      boiled it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
      population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax base
      that it has, subtract that and that gives you another percentage. And then
      you multiply that times the total tax revenue that's collected throughout
      Canada from that tax source, and then you pay them that amount out of the
      provincial treasury. ... </b></small><small> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conclusion of all this is that the Canadian
    system is really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
    payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described, are essentially
    based on population. Population is in the formula. And if you compare this
    with the way things are done in the States, population plays a very minor
    role in the formula for equalisation payments in the United States. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, how should it be done? Well, there's
    a well known Georgist economist who figured this out a long time ago and
    wrote an article about it. His name is Colin Clark. ... He came up with a
    plan for collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what
    we really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation payment,
    is <i><strong>we should classify local jurisdictions according to land value
    per capita, and those that have the least land value per capita, we'll leave
    all of that land value for them to use for local purposes. </strong>But then we will
    graduate the federal land tax according to the amount of land value per capita
    in the jurisdiction, and thus we will have a federal tax that automatically
    achieves inter-regional equity, without all this razzmatazz that I've been
    describing about inter-regional equalisation payments.<a href="../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html"> </a></i><a href="../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">Read

  <br>
  <small><b>A. Rich and Poor</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are rich jurisdictions and poor. Professor
    Tideman's paper in this conference alludes to this matter in passing. Let
    us support his point with some numbers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In California, you might think that farm
    counties like Tulare have a lot more taxable value per capita than cities,
    but au contraire. Tulare County reports assessed values per capita of $38,100;
    the whole State averages $60,000 per capita. Suburban Marin County weighs
    in with $95,400; urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; Orange County has
    $74,000.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You might also think that Tulare, being
    rural, has a lot higher fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not
    so. The<b><i> Land Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</i></b> in Tulare County
    is 28 percent, compared to a statewide mean of 40 percent, and 47 percent
    in Orange County. (This datum, and others of like kind, refute the conventional
    belief that farm counties are heavy on land in the mix. On this last point,
    I must respectfully take issue with my good old friend Gene Wunderlich, whose
    paper at this conference suggests that farm counties have higher land fractions.
    I wonder if he has perhaps conflated building values with pure land values?
    My data, from California State Board of Equalization, show lower land fractions
    in real estate in the purely rural counties of the San Joaquin Valley.) Grazing
    and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but they are a small
    share of the farm economy. (lnyo County, lightly peopled but heavily cattled,
    has $136,000 per capita, with very few human capita (and its cattle are exempt
    from the California property tax). Major farm counties with intensive farms,
    like those of San Joaquin Valley, have low values of LSREV. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, disparities among cities
    and school districts are much greater. In Tulare County, one pathetic little
    povertyville, the City of Parlier, has just $10,000 of assessed value per
    capita. Here are some assessed values per capita from different California
    cities in the County of Los Angeles: Lynwood, $21,500; Beverly Hills, $294,000
    (14 times Lynwood); City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times Lynwood).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is
      why some critics call the property tax "regressive." It has given some
      plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that switching to a sales tax
      is less regressive than sticking with the property tax. </span>Within each
      city a property tax is progressive, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">when
      your data meld cities like poor little Parlier and Lynwood with Beverly
      Hills, you sometimes find poor people paying more of their income in property
      taxes than rich people, and getting less for it. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Switching
      just the local property tax to land ex buildings will do little or nothing
      to correct such disparities, and therefore make little progress toward
      overall social justice, and the wide support that will evoke. </span>There
      is, in fact, a natural cap on local property tax rates imposed by local
      particularism: the City Council of Beverly Hills will not raise taxes in
      Beverly Hills for the benefit of voters in Parlier.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To avoid
      such regressivity we must work out some formula for power equalization. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
      most straightforward formula is simply a statewide land tax.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>On
      this I must again applaud Dick Noyes in NH - not for what he says, but
      what he does. What he says is that the genius of NH is its local control
      of revenues; what he does is initiate bills for a statewide land tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are many other tax enclaves and exemptions
    by which much property stays off the tax rolls. I have a long list, with
    about 35 items. Here I'll just focus on two: timber and oil. <a

      and investment.</b> Taxing productive activities has counterproductive
      effects, certified by expert economic testimony. </small>

    <p><small>3. <b>Taxing land drains cash from sleeping owners of surplus land,</b> arousing
        them in the most compelling way to the otherwise overlooked opportunity
        cost of their surpluses. A cash drain has wealth and liquidity effects
        that are demonstrably more potent than mere "opportunity cost" in driving
        land to its highest and best uses.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>4. <b>Taxing land motivates sellers and moves the otherwise torpid
          land market.</b> Standard-brand market theories implicitly envision
          a flow of commodities, readily turned up or down with changing demands,
          constantly consumed and replaced, easily divided or assembled, moved
          at will from here to there.</small></p>

    <blockquote><small>Land does not fit the model. "So much the worse for land," pedantic
        theorists seem to say, but our realistic concern is with life and the
        facts that the models do not fit. The models' bright promises of competition
        working smoothly are not borne out by experience with land. It takes
        a strong extra push to make land markets work: land taxes provide that
        push. </small>
        <p><small>As Harold Groves put it, land is not a stream from a fountain,
            it is the fountain itself. Land is fixed in place, easily subject
            to local monopolization, slow to be divided, arduous and costly to
            assemble, and tempting to hold in reserve. Most land lasts forever
            and is accordingly bid up by a wealthy few who seek a store of value
            for the distant future. This strong competition, usually with speculative
            overtones, makes land unaffordable for median buyers seeking to meet
            ordinary needs of the present.</small></p>
        <small> </small></blockquote>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>5. <b>Taxing land promotes markets by pushing central urban land
          into commercial uses yielding high cash flows</b>. "The market" is
          not just an idea or a way of organizing the economy; it is a place,
          a land area dedicated to exchange. Taxing land inhibits most non-commercial
          uses in all those locations having high potential commercial value.
          It by no means destroys non- commercial uses, but relocates them to
          less central places.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>6. <b>Taxing land discourages the motives, currently powerful and
          dominant, to hold land mainly as a store of value and hedge against
          inflation</b>. It also discourages landowners from their current practice
          of borrowing money and then joining and leading the too-powerful pro-inflation
          lobby.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>7. <b>It is arguable that taxes on bases other than land are largely
          shifted to - that is, are drawn from - land rent anyway</b>. That is
          the "Physiocratic doctrine" of tax incidence. It presumes an open economy:
          labor and capital migrate freely across the borders. Given the premise,
          it follows that after-tax wage levels, and rates of return on capital,
          are fixed by world market forces. Local taxation can only affect land
          rent.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <blockquote><small>With closed borders, the Physiocratic rule still applies
        in part. In either case a prime reason for singling out rent for direct
        taxation is that it is simply a more efficient means to socialize rent.
        Tax shifting always implies some friction and loss of taxable surplus: "excess
        burden" is the standard term.</small></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This reasoning also gives us a new, expanded
    insight into the adequacy of land as a tax base. Under Physiocratic doctrine,
    land rent and taxable surplus are nearly coterminous.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Ethical Reasons for Taxing Land Rent</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once land titles are privatized, unearned
    gains and losses begin accruing immediately in this dynamic, complex, stochastic
    world. Expectations change daily; unforeseen windfalls and wipeouts based
    on exogenous, uncontrollable forces soon take over from original expectations
    which formed the basis of initial bids and sales prices. Surprises are inherent
    in land markets because land is irreproduceable, permanent and stationary.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Thomas N. Carver has divided all
    incomes into "<b>Earning</b>s, <b>Findings</b> and <b>Stealings</b>." Historically
    most if not all land rent has been secured by stealing, that is by force
    of conquest in the manner of Iraq taking Kuwait, Cromwell taking parts of
    Ireland, Spain taking the Philippines, Captain John Mason massacring the
    Pequods to take Connecticut, and so on. There is a lingering presumption
    of unsanctity about landed property.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other hand, if buyers in a truly
    free market paid government up front the full present value of land, one
    could regard future land rent as an honest "earning" on their early payment
    to the general fund. That view prevails among landowners and their economists,
    ex parte to be sure, but still arguable. Even from this perspective, however,
    there soon arise windfall rents which are "findings." Such findings are just
    as non-functional socially as stealings based on force, covin and fraud.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A major source of such "findings" is new
    infrastructure which brings benefits to specific lands, and may remove them
    from others. In the Soviet lands, shifting from one political-economic system
    to a radically different one will entail massive changes of infrastructure
    - for example, providing micro-infrastructure like road and utility extensions
    for the many small private farms expected to supplant the present few giant
    collectives. Giant landholding units, both farm and industrial, typically
    have provided internally for much infrastructure that must now be provided
    publicly, no doubt with new plans and layouts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The capital to finance this infrastructure
    now lies sleeping in the lands to be served, whose rise in value will more
    than cover the costs, providing the projects are well planned and executed.
    To be just, however, the land gains must be tapped to pay the cost. If they
    are not tapped, the result will be the unethical process of someone else's
    paying to give the landowners a windfall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some lands are occupied by squatters. When
    these lands are privatized and tenured, removing the squatters poses hard
    ethical choices. Should they be given a prior claim to own the land they
    occupy? With a land tax that problem is <i>de minimis</i>: the state may
    give them titles but then require regular land tax payments to keep them.
    All buyers are more able to pay over time than up front. Many squatters could
    pay that way, too: the effect is the same as extending credit to these poor
    risks on the same terms as to the best. The inevitable non-payers can be
    evicted selectively, leaving most squatters undisturbed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Political Reasons for Taxing Land Rent</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To unify a nation it makes sense for
      a central government to tax the rent from richer regions, those with more
      rent per capita, and distribute it nationally as some form of social dividend</b>.
      Distribution should be on a per capita basis, and/or some surrogate basis
      like average daily attendance at school, military service, or social security
      entitlement. Nothing else that is purely economic seems as well calculated
      to give every citizen a birthright and stake in the nation.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On balance this policy helps overcome ancient
    ethnic loyalties and particularism. One must concede it may be resented by
    local landowners in regions of high land value per capita, exemplified by
    the Province of Alberta, Canada. However, local distribution of superior
    local rents - in money or superior public services - is of no lasting advantage
    to the bulk of local people. The gain is quickly offset by competition from
    immigrants drawn by the higher social dividend. Such migration is also socially
    wasteful.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">National distribution
      of rent, by contrast, has a great efficiency advantage along with its political
      advantage. Local distribution mislocates the population by overattracting
      immigrants to the favored local polities, much as footloose people are
      now drawn to Moscow. </span>National labor resources are wasted when people
      work at jobs of low productivity in order to enjoy the supplement of superior
      local public services. The efficiency advantage of national distribution
      can be made a political advantage because it raises national output for
      the gain of all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The alternative method of distribution, "regional
      equity," sets an implied goal of equalizing rents among regions or local
      polities, rather than among individual citizens</b>. Regional equity says,
      in the extreme, that every cow county deserves its own Grand Central Station
      or JFK Airport to compensate for its inherent geographical handicaps. It
      is a proven, historically certified recipe for dissipating rent and impoverishing
      rich states and nations. It may also be used as a cloak for costly, irrational
      imperialism, a way of clinging to distant, submarginal marches whose maintenance
      and demands exceed all possible economic, military or political gains.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Distribution to local governments is also
    a formula for aborting their development as quasi-independent sources of
    power. Such quasi-independence within a nation is needed to balance central
    power and check despotism. Early U.S. federalism had some praiseworthy features
    (I do not refer to modern "revenue-sharing"). Sovereignty was shared between
    central and state governments ("territories," earlier). States then set up
    counties, generally on the principle of <i>nulle terre sans seigneur</i>,
    that is without leaving much land unorganized and hence untaxed. The states'
    power of taxation was delegated to counties and later to cities as they organized.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A key factor is that little aid (other than
    military) was passed from central to local governments as such. Local units
    had power to tax property, and they used it. They had little effective power
    to tax anything else. In this way, decentralized political power grew, saving
    the U.S. from the evils of overcentralization that beset, for example, its
    neighbor to the south.... <a

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The United States is a federation of states (and Indian-nation reservations),
      with many government functions such as criminal law, education, and local services
      provided by the states. Since the federal income tax was enacted in 1913, taxation
      and authority have shifted increasingly to the federal government.</p>
  <p>In 1902, federal taxes represented 37 percent of total revenue to governments
      at all levels.45 By 2002, federal taxes represented 67 percent of the government
      revenue pie.46 The share taken by state governments rose from 11.4 percent
      in 1902 to 21.5 percent in 1986. Local governments&#8217; share fell from
      51.3 percent in 1902 to 13.7 percent in 1986.</p>
  <p>The change in the share of tax revenues taken by each level of government
      has occurred in large part because of the relative ease of increasing income
      taxes at the federal level, and the relative difficulty of increasing local
      and state taxes. Taxpayers find it much easier to respond to changes in
    state and local taxes, by moving to lower-tax communities. It is far more
    difficult
      to avoid taxes imposed by the federal government &#8212; especially since
      U.S. citizens are taxed even if they are abroad.</p>
  <p>Revenue-sharing from the federal government to the states is, in effect, a
      tax cartel among the states, collusion to tax the population and then divide
      the funds among the states. Taxation at the federal level also encourages spending
      by the federal government instead of the states, so now we have federal departments
      and agencies for education, housing, health and welfare, energy, and other
      fields that once were local, state, or private-sector matters.</p>
  <p>Local and state governments, once willing to go along with the federal government&#8217;s
      tax-and-revenue-sharing scheme, are beginning to realize centralized taxing
      brings with it centralized authority, dramatically reducing local control.
      Revenue-sharing comes with strings attached: Local and state governments
    must abide by federal government mandates in order to obtain the funds, taken
    from
      their residents in the first place. Revenue-sharing allows the federal
    government to sidestep the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides
    that powers
      not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the
    people and the states.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
      Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
      and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of local
      public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
      don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
      to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not
      taxed if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation
      reduces
      the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
      funds in an enterprise.</p>
  <p>When public finance is based on land value taxation, government revenues flow
      up, instead of trickling down from the federal government to the states and
      then to local governments. Real estate taxes today are assessed and collected
      primarily by county governments; under a system of land value taxation, funds
      raised would flow up from the counties to the states, and only then to the
      federal government.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would create a decentralizing force, shifting or &#8220;devolving&#8221; power
      down to local government in accord with the principle of subsidiarity:
    that which can be most efficiently done by individuals or smaller jurisdictions
      should not be done by larger or higher-level jurisdictions. Government
    functions
      would then come under more observation and control by the voters, who can
    monitor and alter local governments much more easily than remote federal
    agencies.
