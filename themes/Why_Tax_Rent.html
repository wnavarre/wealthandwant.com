  </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. An entire nation cannot be
    sold off quickly at other than fire-sale prices. Mass privatization is
    a way of securing the worst possible bargain for the public selling the
    land.</small><br>
    <small>2. In a massive general land sale, most land would be bid up by
    a small number of buyers with surpluses of "patient money," many of
    them looking toward use or resale in the distant future. These buyers
    are the kind stigmatized as "land speculators," for their traditional
    indifference to highest and best current use of land.</small><br>
    <small>3. A government selling land, even at fire-sale prices, would be
    swamped with cash flow</small><br>
    <small>4. Governments need revenues in perpetuity.</small><br>
    <small>5. Private wealth being scarce in most Soviet republics, wealthy
    aliens would prevail in bidding for much of the best land.</small><br>
    <small>6. The land market works better, on an ongoing basis, if land
    remains subject to regular taxes or other charges in perpetuity.</small><br>
    <small>7. Counterproductive rent-seeking behavior, in the most primal
    sense, is maximized when land is simply privatized without the state's
    reserving substantial servitudes, especially tax power.</small><br>
    <small>8. Local governments, traditionally undernourished and weak in
    much of the Soviet Union, also need revenues in perpetuity.
    </small><br>
    <small>9. A means is needed gently to pry loose surplus land from state
    agencies like ministries in charge of production.
    </small><br>
    <small>10. Public acquisition of lands for such uses as rights-of-way
    (r.o.w.), schools, reservoirs, air bases, parks, and watershed
    protection becomes much more costly when all land is privatized first.</small></div>

    </small>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Taxing land allows us to
    avoid taxing functional activities like production, exchange, work,
    saving, and investment.</small><br>
    <small>2. Taxing land holds down its purchase price, thus easing and
    democratizing entry.</small><br>
    <small>3. Taxing land drains cash from sleeping owners of surplus land,
    arousing them in the most compelling way to the otherwise overlooked
    opportunity cost of their surpluses.</small><br>
    <small>4. Taxing land motivates sellers and moves the otherwise torpid
    land market.</small><br>
    <small>5. Taxing land promotes markets by pushing central urban land
    into commercial uses yielding high cash flows. </small><br>
    <small>6. Taxing land discourages the motives, currently powerful and
    dominant, to hold land mainly as a store of value and hedge against
    inflation. </small><br>
    <small>7. It is arguable that taxes on bases other than land are
    largely shifted to - that is, are drawn from - land rent anyway. </small></div>

Capacity of Land </a></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature of
        land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic base
        of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder
        than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
        land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any city,
        so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold. They like
        the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your balance

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>... Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
          him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his
          labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
      <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the
          value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
          of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system
          no one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld
          from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
      <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its
          death blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions
          of acres from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned
          by their present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this
          not merely on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled
          districts.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
                be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
                economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in
                economics. The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot
                limit the supply of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax
                is laid, charging all the rent they can get. There is nothing in a
                tax on the rental value of land to make tenants willing to pay more
                or to make land more difficult to hire. On the contrary, more land
                will be on the market, because of such a tax, rather than less, since
                the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding land out of use and unimproved
                for mere speculation. The competition of former vacant land speculators
                to get their land used will make land cheaper to rent rather than more
                expensive. And since only the net rent remaining after the tax is subtracted
                is capitalized into salable value, land will be very much cheaper to
                buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
          land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as
          agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep
          land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for
          it than the use to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere
          that land had attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now,
          as a fine upon improvement, would operate to force improvement. Whoever
          planted an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory,
          no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept
          so much land idle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
              his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with
          stock.</li>
        <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the
          privilege of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use
          it, as his neighbor
              who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
        <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon
          valuable land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile
          of great
              warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid
          before labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage
          his labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
        <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much
              for a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
        <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have
          to expend a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
        <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in
              lieu of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery,
          and stock.
            <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional
                      economists, have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension
                      of this point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced
                      that the greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor
                      man who is trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece
                      of land; for, it is said, the higher taxes on the land after it
                      is acquired, offset the lower purchase price. What such objectors
                      do not see is that even if the lower price of land does no more
                      than balance the higher tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one
                      thing, the discouragement to speculation in land), the reduction
                      or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to save
                      in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of taxation.
                      It is easier to buy land, because its selling price is lower, if
                      the land is taxed. And although the land, after its purchase, continues
                      to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully paid out of the annual
                      interest on the saving in the purchase price, but also there is
                      to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and other improvements
                      and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
          would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing
        with each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down
        wages
          to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing
          for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For
        into the labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors
        for
          the employment of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied
          until want is satisfied &#8212; the demand of labor itself. The employers
          of labor would not have merely to bid against other employers, all
          feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased profits, but against
          the ability
          of laborers to become their own employers upon the natural opportunities
          freely opened to them by the tax which prevented monopolization.</p>
      <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
      <ul>
        <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
              from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn
          their labor into the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
        <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
        <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
        <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>

          Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
          11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
          IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
          and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of
          all public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully
        appreciated until we consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
        <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which
          appears in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater
          and greater inequality as material progress goes on, we have found
          it in the fact that, as civilization advances, the ownership of land,
          now in private hands, gives a greater and greater power of appropriating
          the wealth produced by labor and capital.</p>
        <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
          and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to
          counteract this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to
          take in taxation the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be
          totally destroyed. Rent, instead of causing inequality, as now, would
          then promote equality. Labor and capital would then receive the whole
          produce, minus that portion taken by the state in the taxation of land
          values, which, being applied to public purposes, would be equally distributed
          in public benefits.</p>
        <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided
          into two portions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
            producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
          <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
            in public benefits to all its members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong,
          young children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the
          blind, as well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while one
          part represents the result of individual effort in production, the
          other represents the increased power with which the community as a
          whole aids the individual.</p>
        <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken
          by the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends
          to produce inequality as material progress goes on would then tend
          to produce greater and greater equality.</p>
        <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity
          of labor may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to
          the producers of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and
          enjoyments! With present processes the gain would be simply incalculable,
          but just as wages are high, so do the invention and utilization of
          improved processes and machinery go on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
        <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact,
          that while thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency
          of labor, the equalization in the distribution of wealth that would
          result from the simple plan of taxation that I propose, must lessen
          the intensity with which wealth is pursued. It seems to me that in
          a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty, no one would
          desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would take the trouble
          to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle
          of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for
          the sake of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that
          in a state of society where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated
          the envious admiration with which the masses of men now regard the
          possession of great riches, whoever would toil to acquire more than
          he cared to use would be looked upon as we would now look on a man
          who would thatch his head with half a dozen hats.</p>
        <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare
          it? Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development,
          it is not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not
          come from the weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers
          from, and what, if a remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal
          distribution!</p>
        <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
          of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production
          is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one
          of the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane
          desire to get rich at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted
          to scraping together riches would be translated into far higher spheres
          of usefulness. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all
          landholders are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting
          appeals to the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be
        told that this is a proposition to rob them of their hard-earned property.
        But
          a moment's reflection will show that this proposition should commend
        itself to all whose interests as landholders do not largely exceed their
        interests
          as laborers or capitalists, or both. And further consideration will
        show that though the large landholders may lose relatively, yet even
        in their
          case there will be an absolute gain. For, the increase in production
        will be so great that labor and capital will gain very much more than
        will be
          lost to private landownership, while in these gains, and in the greater
          ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the whole community,
          including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly
              benefit all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head
          -- laborers, operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all
          sorts.</li>
        <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
              by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers,
              merchants, manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and
          exchangers of all sorts from the peddler or drayman to the railroad
          or steamship
              owner -- and</li>
        <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those
              whose incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read
