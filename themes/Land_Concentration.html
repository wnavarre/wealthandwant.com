<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse.</p>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. ...</p>
  <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the
      supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power.

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
    and Thence Upon Production</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
      two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
      and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
      And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
      effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
      the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
      community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
      as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
      equality.</p>
  <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
      may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers of
      wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With present
      processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages are high,
      so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and machinery go
      on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
  <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that while
      thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor, the equalization
      in the distribution of wealth that would result from the simple plan of
    taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity with which wealth is pursued.
    It
      seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
      no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would take the
      trouble to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the
      spectacle
      of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for the
      sake of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state
      of society
      where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration
      with which the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches,
      whoever would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked
      upon as we
      would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen hats.</p>
  <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare it?
      Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development, it is
      not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come from the
      weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and what, if a
      remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
  <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
      of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production is
      greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of the most
      obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire to get rich
      at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping together riches
      would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If Adam, when he got out of
Eden, had sat down and commenced to
pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
forth by labour. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labour we
shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labour and to nothing
else. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable

generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the

<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.</strong> (9-10.)</p>
  <p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended on land gives a right
    to ownership of the land, and that the improvement of land creates benefits
    indistinguishable and inseparable from the land itself.</p>
  <p>This contention, if valid, could only justify the ownership of land by those
    who expend industry on it. It would not justify private property in land
    as it exists. On the contrary, it would justify a gigantic no-rent declaration
    that would take land from those who now legally own it, the landlords, and
    turn it over to the tenants and laborers. And if it also be that improvements
    cannot be distinguished and separated from the land itself, how could the
    landlords claim consideration even for improvements they had made?</p>
  <p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words imply. What you really mean,
    I take it, is that the original justification and title of landownership
    is in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither can this justify private
    property in land as it exists. For is it not all but universally true that
    existing land titles do not come from use, but from force or fraud?</p>
  <p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part of the land of Italy is
    held by those who so far from ever having expended industry on it have been
    mere appropriators of the industry of those who have? Is this not also true
    of Great Britain and of other countries? Even in the United States, where
    the forces of concentration have not yet had time fully to operate and there
    has been some attempt to give land to users, it is probably true today that
    the greater part of the land is held by those who neither use it nor propose
    to use it themselves, but merely hold it to compel others to pay them for
    permission to use it.</p>
  <p>And if industry give ownership to land what are the limits of this ownership?<strong>    If a man may acquire the ownership of several square miles of land by grazing
    sheep on it, does this give to him and his heirs the ownership of the same
    land when it is found to contain rich mines, or when by the growth of population
    and the progress of society it is needed for farming, for gardening, for
    the close occupation of a great city? Is it on the rights given by the industry
    of those who first used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes that you
    would found the title to the land now covered by the city of New York and
    having a value of thousands of millions of dollars?</strong></p>
  <p>But your contention is not valid. Industry expended on land gives ownership
    in the fruits of that industry, but not in the land itself, just as industry
    expended on the ocean would give a right of ownership to the fish taken by
    it, but not a right of ownership in the ocean. Nor yet is it true that private
    ownership of land is necessary to secure the fruits of labor on land; nor
    does the improvement of land create benefits indistinguishable and inseparable
    from the land itself. That secure possession is necessary to the use and
    improvement of land I have already explained, but that ownership is not necessary
    is shown by the fact that in all civilized countries land owned by one person
    is cultivated and improved by other persons. <strong>Most of the cultivated
    land in the British Islands, as in Italy and other countries, is cultivated
    not
    by owners but by tenants. And so the costliest buildings are erected by those
    who are not owners of the land, but who have from the owner a mere right
    of possession for a time on condition of certain payments.</strong> Nearly the whole
    of London has been built in this way, and in New York, Chicago, Denver, San
    Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as in continental cities, the owners
    of many of the largest edifices will be found to be different persons from
    the owners of the ground. So far from the value of improvements being inseparable
    from the value of land, it is in individual transactions constantly separated.
    For instance, one-half of the land on which the immense Grand Pacific Hotel
    in Chicago stands was recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is a not
    infrequent occurrence for one person to own a fruit-tree and another to own
    the ground in which it is implanted.</p>
  <p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether it be clearing, plowing,
    manuring, cultivating, the digging of cellars, the opening of wells or the
    building of houses, that so long as its usefulness continues does not have
    a value clearly distinguishable from the value of the land. For land having
    such improvements will always sell or rent for more than similar land without
    them.</p>
  <p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what the land irrespective
    of improvement would bring, it will take the benefits of mere ownership,
    but will leave the full benefits of use and improvement, which the prevailing
    system does not do. And since the holder, who would still in form continue
    to be the owner, could at any time give or sell both possession and improvements,
    subject to future assessment by the state on the value of the land alone,
    he will be perfectly free to retain or dispose of the full amount of property
    that the exertion of his labor or the investment of his capital has attached
    to or stored up in the land.</p>
  <p>Thus, what we propose would secure, as it is impossible in any other way
    to secure, what you properly say is just and right &#8212; &quot;that
    the results of labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; But private
    property in land &#8212; to allow the holder without adequate payment to
    the state to take for himself the benefit of the value that attaches to land
    with social growth and improvement &#8212; does take the results of labor
    from him who has labored, does turn over the fruits of one man&#8217;s labor
    to be enjoyed by another. For labor, as the active factor, is the producer
    of all wealth. Mere ownership produces nothing. A man might own a world,
    but so sure is the decree that &#8220;by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou
    eat bread,&#8221; that without labor he could not get a meal or provide himself
    a garment. <strong>Hence, when the owners of land, by virtue of their ownership
    and without laboring themselves, get the products of labor in abundance,
    these
    things must come from the labor of others, must be the fruits of others&#8217; sweat,
    taken from those who have a right to them and enjoyed by those who have no
    right to them.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The only utility of private ownership of land as distinguished from
      possession is the evil utility of giving to the owner products of labor
      he does not
    earn.</strong> For until land will yield to its owner some return beyond that of the
    labor and capital he expends on it &#8212; that is to say, until by sale
    or rental he can without expenditure of labor obtain from it products of
    labor, ownership amounts to no more than security of possession, and has
    no value. Its importance and value begin only when, either in the present
    or prospectively, it will yield a revenue &#8212; that is to say, will enable
    the owner as owner to obtain products of labor without exertion on his part,
    and thus to enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</p>
  <p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery involved in private property
    in land is that in the most striking cases the robbery is not of individuals,
    but of the community. For, as I have before explained, it is impossible for
    rent in the economic sense &#8212; that value which attaches to land by reason
    of social growth and improvement &#8212; to go to the user. It can go only
    to the owner or to the community. Thus those who pay enormous rents for the
    use of land in such centers as London or New York are not individually injured.
    Individually they get a return for what they pay, and must feel that they
    have no better right to the use of such peculiarly advantageous localities
    without paying for it than have thousands of others. And so, not thinking
    or not caring for the interests of the community, they make no objection
    to the system.</p>
  <p>It recently came to light in New York that a man having no title whatever
    had been for years collecting rents on a piece of land that the growth of
    the city had made very valuable. Those who paid these rents had never stopped
    to ask whether he had any right to them. They felt that they had no right
    to land that so many others would like to have, without paying for it, and
    did not think of, or did not care for, the rights of all.... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming in space.
    Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide the land, share
    and share alike, as individual property. At first, while population is sparse
    and industrial processes rude and primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
  <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and look again.
    Some families will have died out, some have greatly multiplied; on the whole,
    population will have largely increased, and even supposing there have been
    no important inventions or improvements in the productive arts, the increase
    in population, by causing the division of labor, will have made industry
    more complex. During this time some of these people will have been careless,
    generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some of
    them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how they themselves
    and the things they see around them came to be, to inquiries and speculations
    as to what there is in the universe beyond their little island or their little
    world, to making poems, painting pictures, or writing books; to noting the
    differences in rocks and trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts
    and birds and fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the
    many things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
    happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others again will
    have devoted all their energies to the extending of their possessions. What,
    then, shall we see, land having been all this time treated as private property?
    Clearly, we shall see that the primitive equality has given way to inequality.
    Some will have very much more than one of the original shares into which
    the land was divided; very many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in
    all things save this, our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that
    there are no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
    taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency; imagine,
    if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is utterly abolished;
    yet inequality in the ownership of land will have produced poverty and virtual
    slavery.</p>
  <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to say,
    in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can live only on
    land and by the aid of the products of land. They may make machines which
    will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps to fly in the air, but to
    build and equip these machines they must have land and the products of land,
    and must constantly come back to land. Therefore those who own the land must
    be the masters of the rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land,
    he is their absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the
    land only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
    land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as his ownership
    is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in everything as he wills.</p>
  <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so far as to
    make one or a very few men the owners of all the land &#8211; if there are
    still so many landowners that there is competition between them as well as
    between those who have only their labor &#8211; then the terms on which these
    non-landholders can live will seem more like free contract. But it will not
    be free contract. Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor;
    labor can produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
    factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary factors
    of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts as to how the
    results of production are divided, the possessors of these two meet on equal
    terms. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the nature of these two factors
    is very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have his
    stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but labor cannot
    exist without land.</span> If I own a piece of land, I can let it lie idle
    for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the laborer must eat every day, and his family
    must eat. And so, in the making of terms between them, the landowner has
    an immense advantage over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that
    the intense pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
    urged by hunger.</span> And, further than this: As population increases,
    as the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
    are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a larger
    and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it produces. That
    is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this steady rise in the
    value of land brings about a confident expectation of future increase of
    value, which produces among landowners all the effects of a combination to
    hold for higher prices. Thus there is a constant tendency to force mere laborers
    to take less and less or to give more and more (put it which way you please,
    it amounts to the same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity
    to work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our little
    island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some of the people
    would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all the fruits of labor
    without doing any labor at all, while others would be forced to work the
    livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
  <p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us suppose
    great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the steam-engine, the power-loom,
    the Bessemer process, the reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving
    devices that are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
  <p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is to increase
    the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the same amount
    of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater amount with the same
    labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen the necessity for land. Until
    we can discover some way of making something out of nothing &#8211; and that
    is so far beyond our powers as to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there
    is no possible discovery or invention which can lessen the dependence of
    labor upon land. And, this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving
    devices, land being the private property of some, would simply be to increase
    the proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for the
    use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and inventions
    would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more dependent.</p>
  <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving inventions to
    go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to perfection. What
    then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done away with, all the wealth
    that the land could produce would go entire to the landowners. None of it
    whatever could be claimed by any one else. For the laborers there would be
    no use at all. If they continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers
    on the bounty of the landowners! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In New York, in San Francisco,
in Washington, Boston, Chicago, and
St. Louis, live men who own large tracts of land which they seldom or
never see. A resident of Rochester is said to own no less than four
hundred farms in different States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky)
comprises thirty-five thousand acres. Under the plantation system of
farming and that of stock-raising on a grand scale, which are
developing so rapidly in our new States, very much of the profits go to
professional men and capitalists who live in distant cities.
Corporations whose stock is held in the East or in Europe own much
greater bodies of land, at much greater distances, than do the London
corporations possessing landed estates in Ireland. To say nothing of
the great land-grant railroad companies, the Standard Oil Company
probably owns more acres of Western land than all the London companies
put together own of Irish land. And, although landlordism in its
grosser forms is only beginning in the United States, there is probably
no American, wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity
see some instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to
concentration born of the new era ushered in by the application of
steam shows itself in this way as in many others. To those who can live
where they please, the great cities are becoming more and more
attractive. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>What seem to be considered the most radical propositions yet
made
are those for the creation of a "peasant proprietary" &#8211; the State
to buy out the landlords and resell to the tenants, for annual
payments extending over a term of years, and covering principal and
interest. Waiving all practical difficulties, and they are very
great, what could thus be accomplished? Nothing real and permanent.
For not merely is this, too, but a partial measure, which could not
improve the condition of the masses of the people or help those most
needing help, but no sooner were the lands thus divided than a
process of concentration would infallibly set in which would be all
the more rapid from the fact that the new landholders would be
heavily mortgaged. The tendency to concentration which has so
steadily operated in Great Britain, and is so plainly showing itself
in our new States, must operate in Ireland, and would immediately
begin to weld together again the little patches of the newly created
peasant proprietors. The tendency of the time is against peasant
proprietorships; it is in everything to concentration, not to
separation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The tendency which has
wiped out the small landowners,
the boasted yeomanry, of England &#8211; which in our new States is
uniting the quarter-sections of preemption and homestead settlers
into great farms of thousands of acres </span>&#8211; is already too strong
to
be resisted, and is constantly becoming stronger and more
penetrating. For it springs from the inventions and improvements and
economies which are transforming modern industry &#8211; the same
influences which are concentrating population in large cities,
business into the hands of great houses, and for the blacksmith
making his own nails or the weaver working his own loom substitute
the factory of the great corporation. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the fatal defect of all these
schemes as remedial measures is,
that they do not go to the cause of the disease.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What they propose to do, they
propose to do for merely one class
of the Irish people &#8211; the agricultural tenants. Now, the
agricultural tenants are not so large nor so poor a class (among them
are in fact many large capitalist farmers of the English type) as the
agricultural laborers, while besides these there are the laborers of
other kinds &#8211; the artisans, operatives, and poorer classes of the
cities. What extension of tenant-right or conversion of
tenant-farmers into partial or absolute proprietors is to benefit
them? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Even if the number of owners of
Irish soil could thus be
increased, the soil of Ireland would still be in the hands of a
class, though of a somewhat larger class. And the spring of Irish
misery would be untouched. Those who had merely their labor would be
as badly off as now, if not in some respects worse off. Rent would
soon devour wages, and the injustice involved in the present system
would be intrenched by the increase in the number who seemingly
profit by it.&nbsp; </span></small><small>... <span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
As I say, the man that owns the land is the master of those who must
live on it. Here is a modern instance: you who are familiar with the
history of the Scottish Church know that in the forties there was a
disruption in the church. You who have read Hugh Miller's work on "The
Cruise of the Betsey" know something about it; how a great body, led by
Dr. Chalmers, came out from the Established Church and said they would
set up a Free Church. In the Established Church were a great many of
the landowners. Some of them, like the Duke of Buccleugh, owning miles
and miles of land on which no common Scotsman had a right to put his
foot, save by the Duke of Buccleugh's permission. These landowners
refused not only to allow these Free Churchmen to have ground upon
which to erect a church, but they would not let them stand on their
land and worship God. You who have read "The Cruise of the Betsey" know
that it is the story of a clergyman who was obliged to make his home in
a boat on that wild sea because he was not allowed to have land enough
to live on. In many places the people had to take the sacrament with
the tide coming to their knees &#8212; many a man lost his life worshipping
on the roads in rain and snow. They were not permitted to go on Mr.
Landlord's land and worship God, and had to take to the roads. The Duke
of Buccleugh stood out for seven years compelling people to worship in
the roads, until finally relenting a little, he allowed them to worship
God in a gravel pit; whereupon they passed a resolution of thanks to
His Grace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But that is not what I wanted to tell you. The thing that struck
me was this significant fact: As soon as the disruption occurred, the
Free Church, composed of a great many able men, at once sent a
delegation to the landlords to ask permission for Scotsmen to worship
God in Scotland and in their own way. This delegation set out for
London &#8212; they had to go to London, England, to get permission for
Scotsmen to worship God in Scotland, and in their own native home!</small><br>
<br>
<small>But that is not the most absurd thing. In one place where they
were refused land upon which to stand and worship God, the late
landowner had died and his estate was in the hands of the trustees, and
the answer of the trustees was, that so far as they were concerned they
would exceedingly like to allow them to have a place to put up a church
to worship God, but they could not conscientiously do it because they
knew that such a course would be very displeasing to the late Mr.
Monaltie! Now this dead man had gone to heaven, let us hope; at any
rate he had gone away from this world, but lest it might displease him
men yet living could not worship God. Is it possible for absurdity to
go any further?</small><br>
<br>
<small>You may say that those Scotch people are very absurd people, but
they are not a whit more so than we are. I read only a little while ago
of some Long Island fishermen who had been paying as rent for the
privilege of fishing there, a certain part of the catch. They paid it
because they believed that James II, a dead man centuries ago, a man
who never put his foot in America, a king who was kicked off the
English throne, had said they had to pay it, and they got up a
committee, went to the county town and searched the records. They could
not find anything in the records to show that James II had ever ordered
that they should give any of their fish to anybody, and so they refused
to pay any longer. But if they had found that James II had really said
they should they would have gone on paying. Can anything be more
absurd?&nbsp; ... <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, here is a desert. Here is a
caravan going along over the desert. Here is a gang of robbers. They
say: "Look! There is a rich caravan; let us go and rob it, kill the men
if necessary, take their goods from them, their camels and horses, and
walk off." But one of the robbers says:&nbsp; "Oh, no; that is
dangerous; besides, that would be stealing! Let us, instead of doing
that, go ahead to where there is a spring, the only spring at which
this caravan can get water in this desert. Let us put a wall around it
and call it ours, and when they come up we won&#8217;t let them have any
water until they have given us all the goods they have." That would be
more gentlemanly, more polite, and more respectable; but would it not
be theft all the same? <span style="font-weight: bold;">And is it not
theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of population
and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as people come
into the world and population increases, will not let this increasing
population use the land until they pay an exorbitant price?</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">That is the sort of theft on
which our first families are founded. Do that under the false code of
morality which exists here today and people will praise your
forethought and your enterprise, and will say you have made money
because you are a very superior person, and that all can make money if
they will only work and be industrious!</span> But is it not as clearly
a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not steal," as taking the money
out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we ourselves
must not steal. But does it not also mean that we must not suffer
anybody else to steal if we can help it?</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we,
all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime
that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212;
they are not to blame above anyone else, but we who permit them to
monopolize land are also parties to the theft. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>What we propose to do is to divide up the rent that comes from
land; and that is a very easy thing.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We need not disturb anybody in
possession, we need not interfere with anybody&#8217;s building or anybody&#8217;s
improvement. </span>We only need to remit taxes on all improvements,
on all forms of wealth, and put the tax on the value of the land,
exclusive of the improvements, so that the dog-in-the-manger who is
holding a piece of vacant land will have to pay the same amount of tax
for it as land of similar value with a building or other improvements
upon it. In that way we would treat the whole land of such a community
as being the common estate of the whole people of the community.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The people of New York could manage their estate just as well as
any corporation, or any private family, for that matter. But for the
people of New York to resume their estate and to treat it as their own,
it is not necessary for them to go to any bother of management. It is
not necessary for them to say to any landowner, this particular piece
of land is ours, and no longer yours.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We can leave land titles just as they are. We can leave the
owners of the land to call themselves its owners; all we want is the
annual value of the land. Not, mark you, that value which the owner has
created, that value which has been given to it by improvements; but
simply that value which is given to the bare land by the fact that we
are all here &#8212;that has attached to the land because of the growth of
this great community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And, when we
take that, then all inducement to monopolize the land will be gone &#8212;
then these very worthy gentlemen who are holding one-half of the area
of this city idle and vacant will find the taxes they have to pay so
high that they will have to go to work and build houses or otherwise
use the land, or give it away to somebody who will build upon it, or
put it to other productive use. And so it will happen all over the
country.</span> ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Go into Pennsylvania, and there you will see great stretches of
land, containing enormous deposits of the finest coal, held by
corporations and individuals who are working but little part of it. On
these great estates the common American citizens who mine the coal are
not allowed even to rent a piece of land, let alone buy it. They can
only live in company houses; and they are permitted to stay in them
only on condition (and they have to sign a paper to that effect) that
they can be evicted at any time on five days&#8217; notice. The companies
combine and make coal artificially dear here, and make employment
artificially scarce in Pennsylvania.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, why should not those miners, who work on it half the time,
why shouldn&#8217;t they dig down in the earth and get up coal for
themselves? Who made that coal? There is only one answer &#8212; God made
that coal. Whom did He make it for? Surely you would say that God made
it for the people that would be one day called into being on this
earth. But the laws of Pennsylvania, like the laws of New York, say God
made it for this corporation and that individual; and thus a few people
are permitted to deprive miners of work and make coal artificially
dear. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

that robs men of their birthright can be removed otherwise than by
opening to all the bounty that God has provided for all!</small></div>

not irresistibly follow that to give the land in ownership to some men
and to deny to others all right to it is to divide mankind into the
rich and the poor, the privileged and the helpless? <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land being necessary to life and
labor, where private
property in land has divided society into a landowning class and a
landless class, there is no possible invention or improvement, whether
it be industrial, social, or moral, which, so long as it does not
affect the ownership of land can prevent poverty or relieve the general
conditions of mere laborers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>For, whether the effect of any
invention or improvement be
to increase what labor can produce or to decrease what is required to
support the laborer, it can, so soon as it becomes general, result
only in increasing the income of the owners of land, without benefiting
the mere laborers. ... 
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The same hopelessness attends the
suggestion that working
people should be encouraged by the State to obtain a share of the land.
It is proposed that, as is being attempted in Ireland, the State shall
buy out large land owners in favour of small ones, thus establishing
peasant proprietors.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Supposing that this can be done,
even to a considerable
extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for
the still larger class that must remain the laborers of the
agricultural districts, the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of
the cities?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it not true, as Professor De
Laveleye says, that in such
countries as Belgium, where peasant proprietary exists, the tenants
(for there still exist tenants) are rack-rented with a mercilessness
unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries as Belgium
the condition of the mere laborer is worse than it is in Great
Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the State attempts to
buy up land for peasant proprietors, will not the effect be, what is
seen today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus
make it more difficult far those. not so favoured, and for those who
will came after, to get land?<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Aside from all this, any scheme of
dividing up land while
maintaining private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot
co-exist with the treatment of land as private property where
civilisation is materially advancing and wealth augments.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We may see this in the economic
tendencies that in ancient
times were the main cause that transformed world conquering Italy from
a land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the
fact, that, while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers
were owners of the land they tilled, tenancy has, been for a long time
the all but universal condition of the English farmer. And now the
mighty forces of steam and electricity have come to urge concentration.
It is in the United States that we may see on the largest scale how
their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners into a nation
of tenants.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
principle is clear and
irresistible. Material progress makes land more valuable, and when this
increasing value is left to private owners land must pass from the
ownership of the poor into the ownership of the rich, just as diamonds
so pass when poor men find them.</span></small><br

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
      interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: In <em>Globalization and its Discontents</em>, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

<p>    William Ogilvie: <a href="../docs/Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">An Essay on
    the Right of Property in Land</a> (Scotland, 1782)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... How preposterous, then, is
the system of that country which maintains a
civil and military establishment, by taxes of large amount, without the
assistance of any land-tax at all! - In that example may be perceived
the true spirit of legislation as exercised by landholders alone. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The actual state of Europe, with respect to property in land, is
very
different from what might be desired. That exclusive right to the
improvable value of the soil which a few men, never in any country
exceeding one hundredth part of the community, are permitted to
engross, is a most oppressive privilege: by its operation, the
happiness of mankind has been for ages more invaded and restrained,
than by all the tyranny of kings, the imposture of priests, and the
chicane of lawyers taken together, though these are supposed to be the
greatest evils that afflict the societies of human kind. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The monopoly possessed by land-holders enables them to deprive
the
peasants not only of the due reward of industry exercised on the soil,
but also of that which they may have opportunity of exercising in any
other way, and on any other subject; and hence arises the most obvious
interest of the landholder, in promoting manufactures. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Property in Land, as at present established, is a monopoly of
the most
pernicious kind. The interest of landholders is substituted for that of
the community; it ought to be the same, but it is not. The landholders
of a nation levy the most oppressive of all taxes; they receive the
most unmerited of all pensions: if tithes are oppressive to industry,
rents capable of being raised from time to time are much more so. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Regarding the whole wealth of the community, as belonging of
right to
themselves, landholders stand foremost in opposing the imposition of
exorbitant taxes by the State, forgetting the exorbitancy of that
taxation which they themselves impose on the cultivators of the soil,
and which the sovereign may in justice, and in the way of retaliation
ought to, regulate and restrain. They clamour aloud against pensions
and sinecure places, bestowed by the sovereign, not adverting that
their own large incomes are indeed pensions, and salaries of sinecure
offices, which they derive from the partiality of municipal law in
favour of that order of men by whom its regulations are virtually
enacted.... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

"A. J. O."&nbsp; (probably Mark Twain)&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
  estate and 100 slaves, all the land about being held in the same way by
  people of the same class as myself. It is a profitable business, but
  there are many expenses and annoyances attached to it. I must keep up
  my supply of slaves either by buying or breeding them. I must pay an
  overseer to keep them continually to their work with a lash. I must
  keep them in a state of brutish ignorance (to the detriment of their
  efficiency), for fear they should learn their rights and their power,
  and become dangerous. I must tend them in sickness and when past work.
  And the slaves have all the vices and defects that slavery engenders;
  they have no self-respect or moral sense; they lie, they steal, they
  are lazy, shirking work whenever they dare; they do not care what
  mischief their carelessness occasions me so long as it is not found
  out; their labor is obtained by force, and given grudgingly; they have
  no heart in it. All these things worry me.</small>    </p>
  <p><small><strong>Flash!</strong></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
      unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were free
      they would still have to look to me for work somehow. So one day I
      announce to them that they are all free, intimating at the same time I
      will be ready to employ as many as I may require on such terms as we
      may mutually and independently agree. What could be fairer? They are
      overjoyed, and falling on their knees, bless me as their benefactor.
      Then they go away and have a jollification, and next day come back to
    me to arrange the new terms. ... <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html"><span

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is traditionally subject to
a host
of legal and customary
limits on use and ownership.&nbsp; Covenants are found in land titles:
seldom in titles to cars or canned goods.&nbsp; Divided ownership is
common, there is so much about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
easements through, air rights over, mineral
rights under, and neighbors and zoning all around any parcel of
land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is unavoidably a social process, there
is
no other way.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A large share of the more valuable land in cities is held by
estates.&nbsp; Public and eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are
preferentially tax
exempt and often without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water
licenses are held subject to "use it or lose it" traditions
leading to appalling waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting licenses are
highly political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with the
characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of
non-economic pressures. </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Land is a major basis of market power</b></small><br>
<small><b></b></small><br>
<small>We have seen that landownership conveys superior bargaining
power
(A-?),
accretes around existing nuclei (<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html#B-9">B-9,</a>a), and is highly
concentrated
(<a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html#B-9">B-9</a>,b).&nbsp; We have
seen markets are sticky.&nbsp; It follows that
landownership is a natural basis of market power.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Amassing land is always done, can only be
done, by shrinking the
holdings of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to
have
more then B, C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other
way.&nbsp; A can amass more capital by saving, creating new capital,
leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with as much as before.&nbsp; A can
increase his labor income by working longer, or harder, or smarter,
producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He and she
together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is
reproducible, and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land,
however, means just one thing: bumping others.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by
all
with
no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or
Beethoven, or understanding physics is any less because at the same
time
millions of others have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and
science
are the common property of mankind, open to all who care to acquire
them.&nbsp; The
creative producer's pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom
he
shares.&nbsp; The gratification is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp;
The
contrast with landholding is nearly total.<small><span

<small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not,
therefore,
a
threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with
others' doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a
particular limited market, but glutting one market increases real
demand
for the products of other markets, and raises the real value of others'
incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing land, however, has to
deprive
others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated holding and
control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
of
those left out.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can
get
land
is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced
as the solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is
mere temporizing because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and
demand grow, land rents rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the
problem is not production, but distribution".&nbsp; There is no

Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small></a><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanishing
Farmers and Unaffordable Farms </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You might say this would be a blessing for the farmers who were
now more free of these property taxes. </small><br>
<br>
<small>However, it didn't work out that way. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The mean acres per farm (the
average, that is) had remained fairly constant for 65 years
(1870-1935) at about 155 acres</span>, despite two major industrial
merger movements, including the steel
industry. <span style="font-weight: bold;">After 1935 the mean value
took off and had tripled to 462
acres by 1987. As the number of farms were falling, national population
was on the rise.
In 1900 there was one farm per 11 Americans; in 1987 there was one
farm per 113 persons.&nbsp;
</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>Farms became unaffordable for folks starting at the bottom of
the
agricultural ladder. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real wage rates, meanwhile
since 1955, have not risen as fast as
real land prices, and they haven't risen at all since 1975. </span>This
has
raised the labor-price of land (the number of days/years a person must
work at the average wage
rate in order to raise the price of a farm.)&nbsp; Coupling this with
rising acres per farm, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
labor-price of a farm roughly tripled, from about 6 years' wages
(before payroll deductions) in 1954 to about 17 years' wages in 1987</span>.
That, of course, doesn't mean you could buy a farm in 17 years, unless
you didn't eat
anything and saved every penny of your wages to buy a farm.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>That is the mean size. At the same time, concentration of
ownership was rising. That was the subject Henry George and Francis
Walker debated way back in the 1880s. In the process Henry George
invented something, later
to be known as the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "Lorenz Curve"</span>
- academicians are not generous
about crediting Henry George with his various contributions to the
discipline of
political economy. Basically this Lorenz Curve is a way of measuring
concentration by answering the question, what fraction of all the land
is owned by the top ten
percent. The curve extends from zero up to 100 percent. This curve
has been reduced to a single figure, called the Gini Ratio, which is a
measure of concentration
which varies between zero and one. At zero, everyone has the same
amount; at one, one person has it all.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1900 the Census Bureau began publishing farm data ranked by
acres per farm. Using those data, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Gini Ratio was .58 in 1900.</span> By
1930 the GR had gotten up only to .63. This, remember, was the peak
year of property
taxes, before the property tax started waning. The GR began to rise
faster, and by 1950 it was up to .70. It plateaued there for 15 years
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">then rose again to .76
by 1987</span>. That is a high degree of concentration. (By comparison,
GRs
for personal income are much lower, about .40, and are much more stable
over decades.) The
accelerated rise since 1930 coincided with the rise of mean acres per
farm, and both followed the fall of property tax rates.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Gini Ratio has been criticized because it deals only with
the
concentration among existing farms, and doesn't take into account all
of the former farmers who left the business. To adjust for this, we can
simply add them
to the distribution of the farms as farmers with zero land. There are
4-1/2 million farms that died between 1935 and 1988. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you add in the farmers with zero
acres of land to the lowest bracket, that raises GR for 1988 from .76
to .92</span>, a radical rise of inequality since 1930 (.63). But
calculating the ratio this way
gives you a better sense of how concentration has shot up during and
since the Great Depression. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the
Great Depression (1930-1941), six million farms provided a
refuge for the urban jobless and homeless. Today, that refuge is
closed.</span> </small></div>

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Rise of Land Quality in
Vast Farms </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A frequent way to trivialize this information on concentration
is
to say "farms in the Census are ranked by acreage and so the degree
of concentration is a statistical illusion." And "it looks like
concentration because
you are mixing million acre ranches in New Mexico with family farms
in Iowa or New England, which are worth much more per acre, and if you
adjust for that it
is not as concentrated." That is a common allegation.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>There are two things wrong with that allegation, that make it
pure
humbug. </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
first is, when you rank farms by acres per farm, as the Census
does, the quality of land in the top bracket has been going up very
sharply over this period. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>One example has to do with <span style="font-weight: bold;">irrigation</span>.
About 60 to 80 years ago,
1890-1930, irrigation was the refuge of the small farmer -- it was
the new frontier, and specifically in California. A lot of publicity
has been given to
something called the Irrigation District movement, whereby farms and
cattle ranches were incorporated into taxing districts or irrigation
districts, which
taxed land and exempted improvements and used tax powers to issue
bonds and build expensive irrigation units. And under this system,
people in the district
paid for water whether they used it or not, and caused a revolution
in California agriculture from 1900 to about 1930. It was a fantastic
case study in economic
development (which has been mostly ignored by academic and government
economists). As a result, the average size of a farm in California went
way down.
And the concentration of land went way down, and irrigation was at
the forefront of this.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>When irrigation was young in Anglo-America (1890-1914), it was
the
recourse of small farmers and ranchers. Then, vast spreads were
subdivided to create small irrigated farms. There was drastic
subdivision and
intensification (1900-1930). After the 1930s drop in property tax
rates, this land has been reconsolidated. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you don't tax land, conglomeration
occurs
inexorably. </span>The sections buy out the quarters. This has
happened in
irrigated agriculture faster than almost anywhere else. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. Irrigated land is worth a lot more than
dry land.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land in farms of 1,000 acres and over actually dropped
(nationally) by 15 percent from 1900 to 1910, the only drop on
record. Now, however, 34 percent of all irrigated land is in the top
bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. Control of irrigated land means control over water. Control of
water gives control over arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control
based on water have become
highly concentrated. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For farms with
irrigated land, the Gini Ratio is
.82, substantially higher than the GR of .76 for all farms.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">From 1930-87, the fraction of
all farm acres in units of 1,000
acres and over rose from 28% of the total to 62% of the total. </span>That
is a rise of 123% over the 1930 base. That rise in degree of
concentration is impressive, all
by itself. At the same time, however, the mean value per acre in the
largest spreads was rising much faster than that of other farms. In
result, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the value of the
real estate (land and buildings) in these giant spreads rose from 8%
of the total in 1930 to 38% of the total in 1987.</span> That is a rise
of 375% over the 1930 base.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
second thing that makes the trivialization humbug is a
statistical principle called "regression fallacy."</span> Many people,
otherwise bright, are thicker than mud when it comes to picking up on
this principle, so there must be
some mental block built into the culture. Once you see this "cat,"
however, it's pretty simple and straightforward. It says that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the degree of
concentration you find
in any distribution depends on what you choose as the ranking
variable.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>If you want
to compare the concentration of value with the concentration of
acreage, you can't rank the farms by acreage and then take the top
bracket and ask what the value is. You have got to re-rank them by
value, and these are
entirely different rankings with an entirely different collection of
farms in the top bracket, and </small><br>
<small>naturally these are more valuable farms. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This reranking, farm by farm, is almost impossible to do from
published census data, which come in large groups. But I managed to
do it with some other series, and I can vouch for the fact that if you
do rewrite the data by
value, you get a higher - not a lower - degree of concentration in
terms of value than in terms of acreage.&nbsp;
</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, for those two reasons, concentration of land ownership is
not
only high but it has risen at a very rapid rate.&nbsp;
</small><br>
<br>
<small>To sum up, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior
wealth can no longer buy in.&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a
given number of farms. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Higher quality land is moving into bigger
farms. "Gamma" is the top bracket acre value divided by the mean acre
value, and it is
rising. The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland and
irrigated land in vast farms. Rising price to cash flow (P/C) ratios
reflect a higher land share
of real estate value (LSREV), and they mean it is harder for a
newcomer to acquire any farm acres. The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been
pulled up. Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside
finance; exit and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes
accompanied and followed a 40 percent
drop in farm property taxes.&nbsp; </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conclusion: to redemocratize
farming, promote small farms and
break up big ones, raise land tax rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a

<blockquote>
  <p>Several million persons, perhaps half the resident adult population, hold
    titles to land in southern California. With so many holders, the median holding
    is perforce small, although well above the national median. But the mean holding
    is well above the median, indicating a skewed distribution.<br>
    <br>
    All wealth distributions are skewed; so, to a lesser degree, are income distributions.
  Landholding, however, is more skewed than other distributions. In 1985 the
    Internal Revenue Service released a Report based on a study of 1983 estate
    tax returns.
  According to the Report, "More than one half of his (the mean top wealth-holder's)
  wealth was held as real estate and corporate stock, with real estate surpassing
  corporate stock as the most prominent asset in the top wealth-holder's portfolio." (AP
  dispatch by Jim Luther, Riverside Press Enterprise, 8 March 1985, p. A3.) This
  Report warrants careful study.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOLDINGS BY ALIENS</span><br>
    <br>
  Several studies have shown the largest holders of land in any region are likely
  to be diversified large holders from outside the region. This seems to hold here
  as well.<br>
    <br>
    Non-resident aliens own about 75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A. CBD
    west of Broadway [L.A. Times 21 Sept 86].<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Grosvenor</span>, an Englishman, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a.k.a.
    The Duke of Westminster</span>, is one of these is. Grosvenor owns half the
    Wells Fargo Building on a valuable site in downtown L.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;Grosvenor
    also holds 17 acres in Silicon Valley. He also holds Annacis Island, 1200
    acres near Vancouver, B.C. He is a major owner in downtown Melbourne. He
    is diversified
    around the world. These are parts of his overseas holdings. Their value was
    estimated in 1985 at $1.3 billion, but they were not for sale and the basis
    for the valuation is not given. Like city land worldwide, they must have
    doubled in price, 1985-89 - and then dropped again.<br>
    <br>
  The core of Grosvenor's holdings is 300 acres in central London, including
  half the Mayfair District, most of Belgravia, and Grosvenor Square where the
  U.S.
  Embassy is one of his many lessees. His country estate is 4500 acres. Grosvenor,
  along with Earl Cadogan, the Duke of Bedford, Viscount Portman, and Lord Howard
  de Walden, pretty well control London land. [L.A. Times, 9/85] ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Calling
for "a modern equivalent of Jubilee," signers of a proposal
fundamentally to revise the property tax structure petitioned the
endorsement of the 1984 General Conference of the United Methodist
Church. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The proposal, which the
conference did endorse, sought to shift
taxes from labor to land values. Combining good biblical theology with
public policy insight, the plan offers a simple but critical tax change
as a way of dealing with "poverty, joblessness, slums, urban decay,
farmland destruction, the erosion of public services and facilities and
social justice."</span></small></font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The current
property tax combines land and building
taxes; recently, it has become a tax mostly on buildings. As a result,
owner-made building improvements are overtaxed, while land is
under-taxed. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">undertaxing land
encourages its disuse</span>. The Methodist
petitioners&#8217; simple proposal was to tax land, not buildings. The
possibilities are great for achieving social justice through this
easily implemented change in the property tax. <strong>...</strong></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The
generally held belief that ours is a nation of small landholders is a
myth. According to Gene Wunderlich, quoted in a 1979 <i>Harper&#8217;s </i>article,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
"about 3 percent of the population owns 55 percent of all American
land." And that same 3 per cent holds "95 percent of the private land."</span>
Furthermore, while 64 per cent of families own or are in the process of
buying their residences, the residential sector occupies only 2 per
cent of the 1.3 billion acres of privately held land.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Feudalism,
it seems, is still with us; its new face
is the landlordism that lets a few benefit from what belongs to
society. This lopsided arrangement denies the Bible&#8217;s insistence that
an equitable share of the Lord&#8217;s resources is the birthright of all
humans. While the U.S. is infinitely better off than the countries of
Latin America, Asia and Africa, our situation is worsening. Consider
these facts:

in 1970,
25 per cent of income generally went for rent, today, according to
National Low-Income Housing Coalition reports, that percentage for many
renters, especially the poor, has doubled.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Early in
the century, poor immigrants in New York
City could buy or lease a shop with a fair chance of prospering. Now
many minorities face site costs that almost doom new businesses from

years ago, a startling change even when considering inflation.</small></font></small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>On the
federal level, while the wages of ordinary
workers find no shelter from the Internal Revenue Service, exemptions
and special preferences for landowners whittle down their taxes or turn
real estate losses into profits. The 1986 Tax Reform Act aims to reduce
these privileges, but landowners&#8217; past ingenuity in avoiding taxation
warrants continued vigilance over tax structures. At the local level,
the property tax rises for owners who build or improve their homes,
rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of
the Joneses, the Smiths and the Greens.</small></font></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The

tax office, seeing that they have has added air conditioning, a
recreation room and a new roof, raises their assessment. Never mind
that the Joneses improved their neighborhood and generated jobs and
business. The result will be higher taxes not only this year, but as
long as they keep the house in good condition.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Smiths&#8217; home of the same size and age is an
eyesore. </span>The yard is full of junk, gutters are rusted, screens
are
torn, paint is peeling. The tax office says it is worth less than last
year. The Smiths&#8217; taxes are reduced, a "reward" for blighting the
community.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
land value plan suggested here -- increasing land taxes, while
decreasing taxes on labor, production and buildings -- achieves the
same Jubilee goal without negative effects. It lets everyone share the
economic value of the land rather than the land itself, just as a
corporation, instead of carving up physical portions of itself each
year, lets shareholders enjoy portions of the profit. ...

cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter

It Over Us</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through creating
wealth (in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in
a free and fair market) or through living off the wealth really created
by others. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. Such examples of fairly
earned wealth should not be subject to any (confiscatory) taxation,
which would be legalised robbery. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or
privilege,
that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
without reimbursing the rest of us. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Here we&#8217;re going to look
at one of the most obvious examples of
unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
important, but the value of the land.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how,
over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>

sport; 
    </small></li>

  </strong> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Britains' wealthiest man gets
rich the easy way -- he has his
underlings collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated
his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre
estate
in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
Belgravia, are
today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span>
...&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His
commercial
property company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast
array of investments and developments around the world. These include
office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>,
business parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>,
luxury
apartments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>. In
the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in
Basingstoke and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use
redevelopment in the centre of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair,
land values are in the stratosphere: in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres of Mayfair for a cool
&pound;335m.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land
value
taxation, the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never
contemplate selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason
for not selling. (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The initial distribution of land
- the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land.</span>
What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles(e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, radio, landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money. Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.</span>&nbsp;<big> </big></small><small><a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">In Liverpool: The Financial
    Reform Meeting at the Liverpool Rotunda </a>(1889)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Slavery and Slavery</p>
  <p>It is the old, old story! And no wonder, for property in land is just as
    absurd! just as monstrous as property in human beings. (Hear, hear, and cheers)
    What
      difference does it make whether you enslave a man by making his flesh and
    blood the property of another, or whether you enslave him by making the property
      of another that element on which and from which he must live if he is to
    live
      at all? (A voice: &quot;None whatever!&quot; and cheers)</p>
  <p>Why, in those old days slave ships used to set out from this town of Liverpool
      for the coast of Africa to buy slaves. They did not bring them to Liverpool;
      they took them over to America. Why? Because you people were so good, and
    the Englishmen who had got to the other side of the Atlantic, and had settled
    there,
      were so bad? Not at all. I will tell you why the Liverpool ships carried
    slaves to America and did not bring them back to England. Because in America
    population
      was sparse and land was plentiful. Therefore to rob a man of his labor &#8212; and
      that is what the slaveowner wanted the slave for &#8212; you had got to catch
      and hold the man. That is the reason the slaves went to America. The reason
      they did not come here, the reason they were not carried over to Ireland was
      that here population was relatively dense, land was relatively scarce and could
      easily be monopolized, and to get out of the laborer all that his labor could
      furnish, save only wages enough to keep him alive even the slaveowner had to
      give this &#8212; it was only necessary to own land.</p>
  <p>What is the difference, economically speaking, between the slaves of South
      Carolina, Missouri, Mississippi, and Georgia and the free peasantry of
    Ireland or the agricultural laborer of England? (Cheers) Go to one of those
    slave states
      in the slave days, and there you would find a planter, the owner of five
    hundred slaves, living in elegant luxury, without doing a stroke of work,
    having a
      fine mansion, horses, [and a] carriage &#8212; all the things that work
      produces, but doing none of it himself. The people who did the work were
      living in negro
      huts, on coarse food; they were clothed in coarse raiment. If they ran
      away, he had the privilege of chasing them back, tying them up and whipping
      them
      and making them work.</p>
  <p>Come to this side of the Atlantic, in a place where you saw the same state
      of development. There you found also five hundred people living in little cabins,
      eating coarse food, clothed in coarse raiment, working hard, yet getting only
      enough of the things that work produces to keep them in good times, when bad
      times came having to appeal to the world for charity. But you found among those
      little cabins, too, the lordly mansion of the man who did no work. (Hear, hear,
      and groans)</p>
  <p>You found the mansion; you did not often find the man. (Laughter and cheers)

<p>      a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
      Wasteland to Promised land:
      Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">How the Other Half Dies</span>,
Susan George wrote that "The most pressing cause of the abject poverty
which millions of people in this world endure is that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a mere 2.5% of
landowners with more than 100 hectares control nearly three quarters of
all the land in the world - with the top 0.23% controlling half." </span>To
recognize this social plague for what it
is, and to avert a backlash of despair, requires a clear understanding
of two great themes: the Promised Land and the Wasteland.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
same God who established communities has also in his providence
ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This not meant to suggest that
land monopolists and speculators have a corner on acquisitiveness or
the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh universal fact of human
nature. As a group, they are no more sinful than are people at large,
except to the degree that they knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at
removing the basis of exploitation. Many abide by the dictum: "If one
has to live under a corrupt system, it is better to be a beneficiary
than a victim of it."</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But they do not have to live
under a corrupt system; no one does. The profit motive can be channeled
in ways that are socially desirable as well as in ways that are
socially destructive. Let us give testimony to our faith that the earth
is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no victims.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the state granted land

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however,
had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When a railroad
magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</span>...

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Society
had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community.</span> Income
and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic justice was and is the
primary concern of Georgist economics,
but not the only one. Land ownership is far more concentrated than
other forms of income or of wealth;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span> <big>as a
rough rule of thumb, approximately one third of the households in the
United
States own no land at all. Because a tax on land cannot be passed
forward, these households therefore pay no taxes at all.</big></small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37 </span>The
taxes come instead roughly equally from residential and non-residential
parcel owners alike. Farmers and foresters, who typically own land of
very low market value on account of its remote location, pay a
negligible amount of taxes. This means, of course that most of the
non-residential tax burden falls upon commercial parcels, but the
burden on tenants represents no change from the going rate of floor
space whatsoever. George himself had given considerable attention to
the virtues of land taxation. Measured against the current principles
of sound tax theory typically enumerated by schools of economics and
public administration, contemporary advocates give the tax high marks.
It is no accident, for example that a total of eight
Nobel-Prize-winning economists have endorsed the principles of land
taxation.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span>
The criteria typically used by experts in tax policy besides equity are
variously defined to include neutrality, efficiency, simplicity,
administrability, and stability. Because taxation inevitably has a
moral dimension, the way in which taxes are designed and administered
is also therefore profoundly moral in its content.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>36For example, 95% of the
USA is
owned by the richest 3% of Americans; 60% of El Salvador is owned by
the richest 2% of El Salvadorans; 86% of South Africa is owned by the
white minority; 74% of United Kingdom is owned by the richest 2% of
Britons; and 84% of Scotland is owned by the richest 7% of Scots. This
probably understates the concentration, because it measures ownership
not by land value but by land area. See

Taxation of St. John&#8217;s University, Staten Island at The World Trade
Center on October 1-2, 1999.<br>
</small><small>38 Eight Nobel Prize-winning Economists have Endorsed
Land Value
Taxation: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milton Friedman</span>:
&#8220;I share your view that taxes would be best
placed on the land, and not on improvements,&#8221; and &#8220;In my opinion, the
least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land, the
Henry George argument of many, many years ago.&#8221;<br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Herbert Simon</span>:
&#8220;Assuming
that a tax increase is necessary, it is clearly preferable to impose
the additional cost on land by increasing the land tax, rather than to
increase the wage tax&#8212; the two alternatives open to the City (of
Pittsburgh). It is the use and occupancy of property that creates the
need for the municipal services that appear as the largest item in the
budget&#8212; fire and police protection, waste removal, and public works.
The average increase in tax bills of city residents will be about twice
as great with wage tax increase than with a land tax increase.&#8221;<br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paul Samuelson</span>:
&#8220;Pure
land rent is in the nature of a &#8216;surplus&#8217; which can be taxed heavily
without distorting <small>production incentives or efficiency.&#8221; A land
value tax can be
called &#8220;the useful tax on measured land <small>surplus.&#8221;<br>
</small></small></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">James
Tobin</span>: &#8220;I think in
principle it&#8217;s a good idea to tax unimproved land, and particularly
capital gains (windfalls) on it. Theory says we should try to tax items
with zero or low elasticity, and those include sites.&#8221;<br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">James Buchanan:</span>
&#8220;The
landowner who withdraws land from productive use to a purely private
use should be required to pay higher, not lower, taxes.&#8221;<br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Franco Modigliani:</span>
&#8220;It
is important that the rent of land be retained as a source of
government revenue. Some persons who could make excellent use of land
would be unable to raise money for the purchase price. <small>Collecting
rent annually provides access to land for persons
with limited access to credit.&#8221; <br>
</small></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Robert Solow:</span>
&#8220;Users of
land should not be allowed to acquire rights of indefinite duration for
single payments. For efficiency, for adequate revenue and for justice,
every user of land should be required to make an annual payment to the
local government equal to the current rental value of the land that he
or she prevents others from using.<br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">William Vickrey:</span>
&#8220;It
(land value taxation) guarantees that no one dispossess fellow citizens
by obtaining a <small>disproportionate share of what nature provides
for humanity.&#8221;<br>
</small></small><small>The endorsements from the last four economists
named above were
taken from a letter dated November 7, 1990 to Mikhail Gorbachev signed
by 30 prominent U.S. economists. That letter is reprinted in Richard
Noyes (ed.), Now the Synthesis: Capitalism, Socialism, &amp; the New
Social Contract. London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1991, pp. 225-230.<br>
</small><small>The second Friedman quotation is from Human Events,
November 18,
1978, p. 14; quoted also in the Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics, New
York: Warner Books, 1993.<br>
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... In the Georgist view, this
economic rent is the public&#8217;s
birthright,<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>
and
the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises approximately a third of the economy as it is currently
calculated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Arrangements such as these are to the followers of Henry
George a far more efficient and moral system of public finance. ... <a

Society pays a price for not adopting taxes which follow the

the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement

Robert G. Ingersoll: <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay
Sermon</a> (1886)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
any land that he does not use.
Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
it. And why? Don't you know that if people could bottle the air, they
would? Don't you know that there would be an American Air-bottling
Association? And don't you know that they would allow thousands and
millions to die for want of breath, if they could not pay for air? I am
not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a
few landlords and millions of tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tenement house is the enemy of modesty, the enemy of virtue,
the
enemy of patriotism. Home is where the virtues grow. I would like to
see the law so that every home, to a small amount, should be free not
only from sale for debts, but should be absolutely free from taxation,
so that every man could have a home. Then we will have a nation of
patriots.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, suppose that every man were to have all the land he is able
to
buy. The Vanderbilts could buy today all the land that is in farms in
the State of Ohio -- every foot of it. Would it be for the best
interest of that State to have a few landlords and four or five
millions of serfs? ... Understand, I am not blaming these people. There
is a good deal of
human nature in us all. You remember the story of the man who made a
speech at a Socialist meeting, and closed it by saying, "Thank God, I
am no monopolist," but as he sank to his seat said, "But I wish to the
Lord I was!" We must remember that these rich men are naturally
produced. Do not blame them. Blame the system! ...<a

    Georgists have focused on urban land, stressing its stupendous value p.s.f.,
    and also its high value per capita. Some have favored ignoring rural areas completely,
    to placate the rural vote, and the putative empathy of urban Americans with their
    rural roots, and the supposed rural preservation of old cultural values. If those
    notions ever had merit, they do not today. George himself did not think they
    had merit in his day, either: his first book, <b><i>Our Land and Land
    Policy</i></b> (1871) went into great detail about the villainies (his word)
    involved in monopolizing rural land from the public domain. He demolished
    economist Francis A. Walker while exposing how
    Walker&#8217;s direction of the U.S. Census concealed the concentrated ownership
    of rural land &#8211; an early example of &#8220;How to Lie
    with Statistics.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the process, George
    invented what today is called the Lorenz Curve, and influenced the U.S. Census
    to begin arranging data in a template geared to that curve, and to report on
    land separate from buildings (which it did until 1940).</span> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today, more than ever, persons of great wealth
        have fled the cities and bought up (or retained) vast and valuable lands
        in rustic retreats. </span>To name but a few, there are San Juan County,
        Washington; Aspen, CO; Vilas and Walworth Counties, Wisconsin; Napa and Sonoma
        Counties, CA; the Sta. Ynez Valley north of Sta. Barbara; Kenedy County,
        TX; Barrington, IL; the Hudson Valley; Berkshire County, MA; Nantucket Island,
        MA; Manchester/Dorset and Woodstock, VT; Fauquier County, VA; Bourbon County,
        KY; and much of the whole State of NM. In addition there are individual spreads
        so vast they constitute regions in themselves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>San Simeon, </li>
    <li>the Newhall empire, </li>
    <li>the Bosworth and Chandler and Tenneco ranches, </li>
    <li>the King Ranch, </li>
    <li>Sta. Catalina Island, </li>
    <li>the Irvine Company and the O&#8221;Neill holdings in Orange County, CA, </li>
    <li>the McIlhenny lands in Louisiana, </li>
    <li>Gardiner&#8217;s Island, New York,</li>
    <li>&nbsp;the Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser timber holdings, </li>
    <li>the Scully farms in Illinois, </li>
    <li>the timber empires of northern Maine, and so on. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once known mainly for blood sports, owners in these areas wrap themselves
    now in the mantle of environmentalism &#8211; a major challenge for those
    seeking to reconcile fair taxation with
    ecological values. </p>
  <p>Where land is valued less for amenities, and more for cash crops, absentee
      ownership runs high in much of Iowa and central Illinois, with rents going
      to Chicago lawyers and European investors. Likewise the oven-like Imperial
      and San Joaquin Valleys of California, whose absentee owners are more likely
      to live in coastal California, but also have addresses all over the world &#8211; some
      real, and some in tax havens (Gaffney, 1982). </p>
  <p>In such regions, land values per capita run high. Vilas County, for example,
      an abandoned old &#8220;cutover&#8221; county centered on Eagle River,
      now has the highest land value per capita in Wisconsin, thanks to its many
      little
      lakes, and the high social status of summering there. </p>
  <p>There is no reason, in equity or efficiency, to exempt all this personal
    wealth from taxation. The challenge is to implement policies to sift out
    the legitimate
      contributions to the environment from the country club and boating and
    beachy and &#8220;trophy&#8221; and &#8220;privacy&#8221; and &#8220;hunt club&#8221; and &#8220;fin
      and feather&#8221; and &#8220;snow-bunny&#8221; qualities that give these
      lands most of their market value. </p>
  <p>Those rustic retreats are only the leading edge of manorial suburbanization.
      Inside them we find low-density, high-valued suburbs like Atherton, Belvedere,
      Rolling Hills, CA; Sag Harbor, Scarsdale, NY; Lake Forest, IL; River Hills,
      WI; North Vancouver and Point Gray, B.C.; West Palm Beach, FL; and so on.
    These are communities that fuel today&#8217;s booming demand for landscape
    architects, and turn so many retired golf professionals into country club
    designers and
      real estate developers. <small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the
rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let
tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong></small></div>

taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands.

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
all declared "compatible" with timber,
hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.&nbsp; </span></span></small><small

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wealth Inequality</strong></p>
  <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal source
    of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource, its private ownership
    necessarily excludes large sections of the community from its benefits. A
    landowning class thereby gains political economic power. In George&#8217;s
    own time the social identity and power of this landowning class was distinctive.
    Those who could not afford to buy land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier
    few who could. By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
    created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners and redistributed
    throughout the community more equitably in order to address social goals.</p>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth.
