          Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_StRPOL15LE.html">Sounding
    the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a>                            </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;In
      addition, the IRS reports nothing at all for the imputed income of
      owner-occupied lands, because this kind of non-cash income is not
      taxable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Todd Sinai and Joseph Gyourko
      of the Wharton School report
      aggregate owner-occupied &#8220;house&#8221; values in the U.S. in 1999 were $11.1
      trillions. The annual rental value of that, figuring at 5%, would be
      roughly half a trillion dollars a year</span> -- quite a chunk to omit
      from the
      rental portion of national income. We also know that the prices of
      lands for both housing and recreation have risen sharply since 1999,
      perhaps by 50% or so, so that $11.1 trillion may be $16.7 trillion now.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">That means that the imputed rent
      income is 50% higher than half a
      trillion (i.e. &frac34; trillion dollars), and also that the net worth
      of the owners has risen by about $5.6 trillion. Such silent gains are
      also a form of income from land. </span>To all that, many economists
      remain
      blind, dumb, and curiously incurious.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>&nbsp;
      Sinai and Gyourko&#8217;s treatment is superior to what one usually sees,
      with some effort made to treat land separately. However, even they,
      like others, write of the imputed income of owner-occupied &#8220;housing,&#8221;
    exclusively. That is doubly misleading. </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, it emphasizes the
    house,
    the building, de-emphasizing the land.</span> That is wrong because the
    income
    proper imputable to the house, per se, is much less than its rent
    equivalent. The house requires constant expenses for upkeep, heating,
    maintenance and repairs, cleaning, painting, etc. etc. The house also
    depreciates, physically. Those expenses and the depreciation must be
    deducted from the rental equivalent to get the net income.
      </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The
      land, that is the space and location, does not depreciate physically,
      and so requires none of those expenses. Its rental equivalent is its
      net current income. Instead, it usually appreciates in value, and that
      annual increment is also a current income. <em><strong>So the &#8220;imputed income of
      owner-occupied housing&#8221; is mostly attributable to the land - but
    no one is saying so. </strong></em></small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, it is misleading
    by omitting vast lands beyond the &#8220;house&#8221;
    value, narrowly defined. </span>We may presume that &#8220;house&#8221; includes
    the land
    under it, and a little yard or curtilage, but what about other lands
    held for the owners&#8217; personal enjoyment? No agency collects data on
    such lands and their values, but common observation tells us they are
    vast and valuable, and dominate values in many &#8220;rural&#8221; counties. <a

    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Red_Blue.html">The Red and the

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just average incomes
      per capita that define the economic position of most people in a state
      or city.&nbsp; The distribution of income and wealth makes a lot of
      difference.&nbsp; But wait again: IRS data, and other data derived from
      IRS sources, vastly misstate the concentration of real income because
      they omit the imputed income of owner-occupied housing.&nbsp; Thus, a
      salary-earner paying high rent in the Gold Coast of Chicago has the
      same reported income as one on the same salary on the same Gold Coast
      who owns his own million dollar house or coop or condo, and pays no
      rent. More: the renter&#8217;s income is actually reported as higher, because
      the owner gets to deduct the costs of ownership, interest and property
      taxes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the renters who turn Chicago blue - along with most
      big cities. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Red_Blue.html">Read the whole

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">In communities like the United States, where the user of land generally
                prefers, if he can, to own it, and where there is a great extent of land
              to overrun, this cause operated with enormous power. </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
                  shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of
                  the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent,
                  must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances
                  through half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before
                  he reaches the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead
                  entry or pre-emption. He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is
                  forced so much farther than he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation
                  which is holding these unused lands in expectation of increased value in
                  the future. And when he settles, he will, in his turn, take up, if he can,
                  more land than he can use, in the belief that it will soon become valuable;
                  and so those who follow him are again forced farther on than the necessities
                  of production require, carrying the margin of cultivation to still less
                  productive, because still more remote points.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> If the land of superior quality as to location
            were always fully used before land of inferior quality were resorted to,
            no vacant lots would
                  be left as a city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties
            in the midst of costly buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable,
                  are withheld from use, or from the full use to which they might be
            put,
                  because their owners, not being able or not wishing to improve them,
            prefer, in expectation of the advance of land values, to hold them for
            a higher
                  rate than could now be obtained from those willing to improve them.
            And, in consequence of this land being withheld from use, or from the full
            use
                  of which it is capable, the margin of the city is pushed away so
            much farther from the center. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read
