<br>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy
Kingdom Come</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The story goes on to
describe how the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided.&nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Aye! When a person sees that,
then there arises that hope of the
coming of the kingdom that carried the gospel through the streets of
Rome, that carried it into pagan lands, that made it, against the
most ferocious persecution, the dominant religion of the world. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Early Christianity did not mean,
in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.</strong>If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? Why were its first professors thrown to wild beasts,
burned to light a tyrant&#8217;s gardens, hounded, tortured, put to
death by all the cruel devices that a devilish ingenuity could
suggest? Not that it was a new religion, referring only to the
future. Rome was tolerant of all religions. It was the boast of Rome
that all gods were sheltered in her Pantheon; it was the boast of
Rome that she made no interference with the religions of peoples she
conquered. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What was persecuted was a great movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212;</span> heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It struck at the very basis of that
monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily.</span> </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> That is the
reason why early Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached. ... &nbsp; <a
