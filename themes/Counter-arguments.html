and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<strong><br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp;</small></strong><small> For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp; The answer to this argument is that collecting a large
percentage of the rental value of land through taxes will require new
assessment methods based on observing the rental price of land rather
than the selling price.&nbsp; I describe how such methods can be
devised.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp; It is true that many
properties have mortgages that would exceed the value of the property
if land taxes were increased significantly.&nbsp; This makes it
necessary to think carefully about who should absorb the decline in
aggregate asset value that would accompany a significant shift toward
taxing land.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is possible to plan for a
restructured financial system that would have shed its dependence on
land as collateral.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; The answer to this
argument is that the use of land as collateral encourages banks to lend
mindlessly to anyone who has collateral, rather than work to find good
lending opportunities.&nbsp; Thus the disappear&shy;ance of land as
collateral would actually improve the efficiency with which financial
resources are invested.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; This argument represents a refusal to make a distinction
that begs to be made.&nbsp; The first principle of economic justice is
that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; While some scholars have
asserted that people have rights to them&shy;selves but not to their
talents, this is nonsensical.&nbsp; Without talents, there is no
self.&nbsp; Talents are fundamentally different from land.&nbsp; The
equal rights of all to land can consistently be asserted while still
asserting that every person has right to the use of his or her talents.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer to Arguments against
Taxing Land</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>One argument that is sometimes made against high taxes on land
is that
as land taxes rise, the selling price of land falls, eliminating the
base of the tax, so that only modest taxes on land are feasible.&nbsp;
As a theoretical matter, this argument is completely false.&nbsp; This
is easier to see if you recognize that a tax on land incorporates a
time dimension that is arbitrary.&nbsp; The tax is prescribed as some
percentage of the value of land per year, but it could just as well be
described as a percentage of the value per month, per day or per
hour.&nbsp; For land that is not rising in value, the percentage of the
rental value of the land that is taken by an accurately assessed tax of
t % per unit of time is t/(t + i), where i is the interest rate per
unit of time.&nbsp; As the unit of time approaches zero, the interest
rate per unit of time approaches zero, so that a tax of t % of value
per shrinking unit of time approaches a tax that collects all the rent
of land, in the limit as the unit of time approaches 0.</small><br>
<br>
<small>While it is theoretically possible to capture fractions of rent
approaching 100% by taxes on the value of land, there are practical
difficulties in doing so.&nbsp; The selling price of unimproved land
will be the present value of the part of rent that buyers and sellers
expect to be left after taxes.&nbsp; Therefore, if taxes collect
fractions of rent that approach 100%, the selling price of land will be
dominated by the errors that are expected in the assessment
process.&nbsp; Therefore a tax system that seeks to collect almost all
of the rental value of land must use some assessment system other than
observing market prices of land.&nbsp; There are several techniques
that may be useful.</small><br>
<br>
<small>First, if nearly all of the rental value of land is collected in
taxes,
the selling price of land will be nearly zero.&nbsp; Assessors can
purchase parcels of land with obsolescent improvements, demolish the
improvements, and offer the land for sale at auction, under a rule that
the bid will be the tax per year for, say, the first three years, and
after that the tax will be determined by the assessor&#8217;s estimate of the
rental value of the land, as determined by similar auctions and other
processes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>If assessors were conducting such auctions regularly, they could
hold
assessment contests in which the contestants competed by offering land
value functions that would be evaluated by the accuracy with which they
predicted auction results.&nbsp; The contestant who provided the
function with the smallest average error would be given a prize, and
the winning function would be used to assess the value of land that had
not been auctioned.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Another thing that assessors can do is to develop options
markets in
land.&nbsp; That is, they can enter into contracts with potential users
of land to supply land with specified characteristics for specified tax
rates.&nbsp; For example, someone who was interested in opening a
restaurant might offer &pound;3,000 per month for a parcel of 2,000
square feet within a quarter of a mile of the center of town.&nbsp;
Such offers would set lower limits on the rental value of land.&nbsp;
With such devices, land can be assessed for tax purposes even if the
selling price of land is close to zero.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is sometimes suggested that collecting all of the rental
value of
land is not feasible because it would bankrupt the financial system,
which uses land as collateral for loans.&nbsp; The use of land as
collateral for loans is a fact that would need to be weighed carefully
in working out a feasible transition to a system of collecting nearly
all rent publicly, but it does not make public collection of rent
impossible.&nbsp; Public collection of the rental value of land, and
the consequent elimination of other taxes, would represent
redistribution from the old to the young and unborn.&nbsp; It is
equivalent to saying that each person enters the world with a more
complete right to himself or herself (to the extent the income and
value added taxes are reduced) and with a right to an equal share of
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; If we are to acknowledge that every newborn
person does have such rights, we must reduce the wealth of previously
born persons, corresponding to the expectation of collecting the shares
of rent of the newborns.&nbsp; The question that then arises is, Who
should pay?</small><br>
<br>
<small>This can be interpreted as a question of who should pay the cost
of an
accident.&nbsp; We have had a moral accident.&nbsp; We have been living
under the delusion that it is possible for a person to have a
respectable claim to a disproportionate share of the gifts of
nature.&nbsp; This is akin to the delusion under which humanity long
lived, that it was possible for one human being to own another.&nbsp;
In recovering from such a delusion, we need to disappoint some
people.&nbsp; If not the slave owners, then the people who compensate
the slave owners.&nbsp; If not the land owners, then the people who
compensate the land owners.&nbsp; I propose that the cost be divided
among land owners, shareholders in financial institutions that made
loans with land as collateral, and owners of wealth in general.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As a first approximation, people would continue to hold title to
the
land to which they now hold title, and would continue to owe whatever
money they now owe.&nbsp; But compensation could be sought on a
case-by-case basis, by individuals who stood to bear the costs of the
moral accident disproportionately and did not have substantial
assets.&nbsp; Any financial institutional whose continued existence was
threatened by the transition would be bailed out in exchange for a
significant fraction of its equity.&nbsp; The costs of the compensation
would be paid by a capital levy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Morality requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all to
the
gifts of nature.&nbsp; Doing so is feasible and promotes efficiency as
well.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"
