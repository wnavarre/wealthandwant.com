<blockquote>
  <p>We're familiar with the word arrogant, but there is also a verb form ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
    Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
    Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke is often misrepresented
by royal libertarians, who
quote him very selectively. For example, Locke did say that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>Whatsoever then he
removes out of the state that nature
hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and
joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
property.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But Locke condemned anyone who
took more than he needed as a
"spoiler of the commons":</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>...if the fruits rotted, or
the venison putrified,
before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature,
and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he
had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they
might serve to afford him conveniences of life. </i></small></div>
  <small> </small>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>The same measures governed
the possession of land too:
whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it
spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could
feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if
either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of
his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of
the earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as
waste, and might be the possession of any other. </i></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke also restricted
appropriation of land by the proviso,
ignored by royal libertarians, that there must be still enough, and
as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in
effect, there was never the less left for others because of his
enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make
use of, does as good as take nothing at all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now if the situation is that there
is enough free land, and as
good, left after you take and cultivate your land, than your land has
no market value, for who would pay you for land that is not better
than land that can be had for free? So, besides the fact that Locke's
justification of privatizing land is far more limited than royal
libertarians portray it to be, it is irrelevant to the question of
land value tax, as it applies only to land that has no value.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, Locke based his
scenario on pre-monetary societies,
where a landholder would find that "it was useless, as well as
dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed."
With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became
appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land
than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as
between them they will have taken all the land, and others will
have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the
Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to
Locke.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And while Locke did not propose a
remedy specifically for to this
problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real
estate.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html"><span
