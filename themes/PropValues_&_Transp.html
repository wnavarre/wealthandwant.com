<blockquote>
  <p>We tend to think of the beneficiaries of investment in transportation as
        being limited to those who actually use the transportation themselves:
        the riders.
      But this is only part of the story. The bigger picture is that every worthwhile
      investment in infrastructure, including transportation, leads property
      values in the area served to rise by more than
    the cost of the project itself. (If this doesn't happen, the project probably
    should not have been done in the first place, or at least should not have
    been
    done at this time.) </p>
  <p>A new train line might only carry, say, 10,000 passengers
    per day, after some startup period. But the owners of the buildings around
    each station can charge their tenants more for the use of their buildings,
    and those with buildings to sell can get higher asking prices as a result of
    that infrastructure. Those with vacant land within a radius of the stations
    will be able to command a higher price, and those with obsolete or vacant buildings
    on their land will be able to charge a buyer more, simply because of the train
    service being available. The effects will be strongest immediately around the
    stations, and spread out in all directions for at least a walking radius, and
    often much further. This represents a windfall gain for them.</p>
  <p>With this in mind, how should we pay for transportation infrastructure?
    Should we use sales taxes to pay for it? Wage taxes? Should we tax buildings,
    in
    proportion to their value? A charge for each parcel? Or should we simply
    tax land value, collecting back for the commons some of the increase the
    infrastructure
    improvement created? Georgists opt for taxing land value.</p>
  <p>Should land taxes pay for the operating costs, or should the operating costs
    be entirely covered by fares? The answer will vary, but consider what would
    happen to land values if the transportation system stopped operating. (How
    long can a transit strike continue in a large city, without hampering the
    local economy?)</p>

from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp; </small></a><small>(1883)</small></small> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great Wealth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
    recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
    I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate than
    he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get
    his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced it than
    did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for the rest
    of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land in the
    early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable. His wealth
    represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of
    the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
    leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
    skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
    he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
    a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper labor
    of Europe," gave him the advantage of a sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day
    of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade would ruin
    our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to
    lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
    what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by the tariff
    that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth."</small>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
    and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account
    for all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
    first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it.
    But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
    fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money enough he
    used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran off opposition
    lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he went into railroads,
    pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working
    and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould
    might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial.
    But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions. It
    was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting
    up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values and
    transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which
    the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
    profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations of
    Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging.
    And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company,
    the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and
    the various rings for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper
    labor of Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of successful
    patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
    value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I
    am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
    in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
    out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
    through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes,
    these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
    of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me recently, "It
    is not on our ordinary business that we make our money; it is where we can
    get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
  <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
  of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
    their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
    ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
    of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
    pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
    was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
    by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get
    a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that
    it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which we
    give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by law and
    by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously rich while
    others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note the elements
    of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building up of all,
    or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous are those
    who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations and that
    the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities
    of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk
    as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
    restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the capitalist
    is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any one get
    as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution
    of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor
    in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the
    laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments
    which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that
    in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion
    to his contribution to the general stock. And in such a social state there
    would not be less incentive to exertion than now; there would be far more
    incentive. Men will be more industrious and more moral, better workmen and
    better citizens, if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his
    family, than where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them
    until some have far more than they could have earned, and others have little
    or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned
    increment </span>Fancy comparing these healthy processes with the enrichment
    which comes to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts
    or at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy population
    around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient, more famous every
    day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway services
    are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly
    to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains
    -- and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements
    is effected by the labour
    and at the cost of other people.</span> Many of the most important are effected
    at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist
    as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his
    land is sensibly enhanced.</span> He renders no service to the community, he
    contributes nothing to the general welfare; he contributes nothing even to the
    process from which his own enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by
    shops or by dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon
    them in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied, undeveloped,
    it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>' -- ripening
    at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for the unearned increment
    of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be diverted to avoid this forbidden area.
    The merchant going to his office, the artisan going to his work, have to make
    a detour or pay a tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance
    of developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing its
    taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken place; and
    that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and taxpayers,
    and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of the world -- the hard
    and growing competition of the world -- both in time and money. And all the while
    the land monopolist has only to sit still and watch complacently his property
    multiplying in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution
    on
    his part; and that is justice! ... <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

 href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">Economics in Support of
  Environmentalism</a></b></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In British Columbia, people move
around a good deal by car-ferry,
because of the terrain. The Provincial Government ("The Crown
Provincial") runs the system. There are many lovely little islands in
the Straits of Georgia, between Vancouver Island and the mainland,
favored by the wealthy, the exclusive and reclusive. Being more
sybaritic than Henry D. Thoreau, and politically puissant, they have
demanded and received car-ferry service. This service costs about $10
for every $1 in revenue. The resulting deficit is covered by raising
rates on the main plebeian line, Victoria-Vancouver. Naturally, these
cheap ferries attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for
land there.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let's go back to those Channel
Islands in British Columbia, with
subsidized car-ferries. Naturally, as I said, these cheap ferries
attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for land there.
Developers and hopeful subdividers bid up land prices. This is not
what the old settlers had in mind: their environment is threatened,
including the habitat of endangered species. They appeal to the
Crown, which subsidizes their ferries, to help them preserve land for
habitat.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They want the government to buy
some of it, paying the high prices
created by the ferry subsidy, to keep it from use by people who might
use the ferries. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the government
would pay twice: to subsidize
the ferries, and then to retire the land at the high prices made
possible by the ferries. </span>Failing that, they want the Crown to
downzone most of it. The landowners are not charged when the ferries
raise their asking prices, but demand compensation when
downzoned.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here,
in microcosm, is the American problem with sprawl and
habitat. </span>Multiply that ferry subsidy a thousand times, and you
have
the Great American System of Public Works and Services for Private
Gain. First the public pays to bring urban demand to remote lands;
now the landowners, the spoiled children of the national family,
demand to be paid again for downzoning or selling that same land to
preserve habitat. They demand payment not to cash in on the
opportunities we just gave them free.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those are the carrots. A good
stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there.</span><span
