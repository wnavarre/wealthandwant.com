band-aid safety nets of the 1940s
and 50s are unravelling and a new Gilded Age is upon us. The wealth gap
is growing. </span>Wages for nearly everyone have stagnated or are
declining. Ever escalating land values push housing prices beyond the
capacity of millions to secure adequate shelter. Worldwide, a billion
people live in degrading destitution lacking basic needs. Local
conflicts and global wars are waged for control of land and natural
resources. Tax funds that could build a world that works for everyone
instead are being directed to biochemical weapons research, building
space laser weaponry, and neo-colonial warfare.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It has been said that the only
two
certainties in life are death and taxes and that the power to tax is
the power to create or destroy. </span>The story of the birth of Jesus
is on one level the story of a family on a long and onerous journey to
pay taxes imposed by the Romans upon the people of the land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We urgently need to establish land tenure
and tax policies based on the deepest wisdom of the Judeo-Christian
tradition - a truth based on the perception of the unity of life, that
all is created by God, and on the realization of the brotherhood and
sisterhood of the one humanity. The privilege of holding large amounts
of land or highly valuable land as individual private property needs to
be a conditional, not an absolute right. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For justice to prevail, the right
to exclusive access to land must be granted only upon payment of full
and fairly assessed land value taxes and resource rents.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have at hand a powerful solution and a way to secure a world
of
peace and plenty. We need to constitute democratic governance on the
firm foundation of equal rights to the land and resources of the earth,
an "earth rights democracy" which removes the burden of taxes from the
backs of those who labor and instead directs government to collect the
value of our common wealth for the benefit of all. A morally correct
form of taxation may not lead to everlasting life, but it WILL promote
and sustain the conditions for lives worth living on planet
earth....&nbsp;</small>

<p>Alanna Hartzok: <a href="docs/Hartzok_HG%27sST.html">In the History of Thought:
    Henry George's &quot;Single Tax&quot; </a></p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">One day, while riding horseback
      in the Oakland hills, merchant seaman and journalist Henry George had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that speculation
      and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the root causes of the
      unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights
    presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
    George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy approach was
    known at that time as the "single tax" - meaning that taxation should be shifted
    off of labor and onto the socially created surplus value of land and other natural
    resources.</span> His message reached as far as the great Russian Leo Tolstoy,
    who was so taken with
    the idea that he frequently referred to George and "Georgism" in his
    novel Resurrection.<br>
    <br>
 During the last 20 years of the 19th century George built
    an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of the wealth
 gap, and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's
    mayor. The "Georgists" were determined to free labor and all productive effort
    from the burden of taxation. Land and natural resources were gifts of nature
    to be fairly shared by all. The role of government would be to secure democratic
    rights to the earth for all people via the collection of resource rents,
    the surplus value accruing to natural wealth, which would be distributed
    in social
    goods, services or by
    direct citizen dividends.<br>
    <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as this solution
    to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist movement was stopped
    in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their money into leading schools of
    economics to encourage the writing of treatises against George and the movements
    he had spawned. </span>The ethical perspective that land is a common heritage
    and the policy approach of land value taxation were subsequently eliminated
    from the field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on only two
    primary
    factors -- labor and capital -- with capital having the upper
    hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of self-employment
    given access to land. This is what the elites and the plutocrats feared most
    - that labor would gain full power to directly produce capital given conditions
    of equal rights to the resources of
    the earth. ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_HG%27sST.html">read the whole article</a></div>
