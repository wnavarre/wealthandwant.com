Licenses to Steal Are Expensive</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The electromagnetic spectrum is,
economically, land, in
that it is a natural resource which cannot be manufactured.
Accordingly, the economic value of a license to use a portion of the
spectrum is determined not by its cost of production, but by its
usefulness in comparison to licenses available for free. And, due to
anticipation of future increases, the market value of a perpetual (or
any long-term) license can grow to levels higher than can be supported
by current use of the license. </small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using financial reports filed by
owners of radio broadcast
licenses, this Research Note shows that license values are approaching,
or may even have reached, such levels. It also shows that the main
asset on these companies&#8217; books is their licenses. This means that,
while Henry George would recommend that substantially all the rent of
these licenses be collected thru taxation, such a policy would be a
major inconvenience for such companies.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This Research Note also
provides some information about auctions of
radio broadcast licenses, and their role in the Federal budget.</small><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This paper stems<font size="-2"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font>
from an
event last year, shortly before the Des Moines conference.
Chicago&#8217;s only remaining privately-owned classical music
station, WNIB<font size="-2"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font>, was
sold for
$165 million. Bonneville International Corporation bought the station
not because they wanted to continue or improve its operation; what
they really bought was a license to broadcast to a market of nearly
10 million people. In fact, they bought the market, at a cost of
about $17 per person.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Well, I used to listen to WNIB,
and I resented being sold for $17.
I wanted to look into the business of broadcast radio, and try to
analyse it in Georgist terms. George pointed out that those who could
monopolize natural opportunities could exact a toll on users, and
that speculation could lead to excessive costs of access which
eventually make productive use impossible.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I found is, first, that the
major asset of broadcasters is
privilege. Actually, I could have figured that out just by reading
the Chicago Tribune<font size="-2"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font>,
who quoted
the publisher of a radio trade magazine: &#8220;These radio stations
are a license to steal. They&#8217;re gushing oil wells.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, second, I found that
speculation in broadcast licenses does
indeed appear to have reached a point where productive activity is
quite difficult, though not yet impossible. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One can make money in
radio, but it&#8217;s mainly done by holding licenses rather than
producing programming. ...<br>
</span><br>
I&#8217;m going to give some background on the industry, then some detail to
support the assertions made above. Then I&#8217;ll treat some related
matters, including the implications of spectrum auctions, future trends
in license values, and, of course, Henry George&#8217;s recommendations.
Limited financial data about the radio broadcast industry is available.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;The 4685 AM and 8032 FM commercial stations licensed4 in the
United
States have literally hundreds of owners. Many are privately-held
corporations with just a few stations, or companies in other
businesses&#8212; notably newspapers&#8212; with a station or two among their
holdings. But the really valuable licenses, those serving large
metropolitan areas, are largely controlled by a few huge corporations.
One report claims that four companies control the stations receiving
90% of radio advertising revenue.5<br>
<br>
The biggest radio broadcaster, Clear Channel Communications, owns 1,140
stations, including five or more in each of the seven largest market
areas.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Infinity Broadcasting, a
subsidiary of multimedia conglomerate
Viacom, has 184 stations in 41 market areas, accounting for 13% of
total U. S. radio advertising expenditures6. Some other large
broadcasters are shown in Table 1. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>...
</big></span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is, I think, well-known that
large corporations can borrow
cheaper than small ones. Therefore, as expensive licenses increase
the amount of upfront money needed to get into the radio broadcasting
business, it becomes relatively more difficult for small operators,
and relatively easier for large ones, to own and operate
stations.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As one station broker put it,
&#8220;First time buyers are not
going to get bank financing. In the present business climate some
experienced buyers are not going to get loans unless they have
&#8216;outside&#8217; assets to pledge. . .Most bankers do not
understand the broadcasting business. . . if it does not have a car
title attached they are without a
clue.&#8221;<font size="-2"><small><b><i>14</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The FCC does not seem to recognize
this problem. In their paper
which &#8220;explains why auctions are superior to comparative
hearings for selecting among mutually exclusive applications for
spectrum licenses,&#8221; FCC staff address the concern that small
businesses may be unable to compete, using phrases reminiscent of
economist jokes: &#8220;Given efficient capital markets, the bidder
with the best business plan, producing the highest expected profits,
will get the best financial backing and will be able to place winning
bids<font size="-2"><small><b><i>15</i></b></small></font>.&#8221; The paper,
of
course, does not consider any other method of spectrum
allocation. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><small><span

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_GRaCoM.html">Geoism,
    Recession
and Control of Monopolies</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems that a great deal of
anti-trust legislation from the
Progressive Era had been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had
started with Thomas A. Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation
bully as he was a pure inventor. Much of this legislation became
unravelled under President - guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the
"entertainment" industry, and political voice for same. Vertical
integration and media mergers and monopolization then ran wild. Disney
under Eisner, of course, has played a role in this. Disney as real
estate developer throws its heavy weight around brutally.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and
what it
would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers,
monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after
all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive Movements. </small><br>
<br>
<small>"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform.
Some
of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
and workers.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs in
the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the
device of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive
privilege, it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting
abuses of power.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
