<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two
  Neighboring Lots</span>  </p>
  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Picture two lots, of similar size, facing onto the same street
          in the central business district. One has a fence around it and a well-mowed
          lawn. The adjoining one has a multi-story building on it. How much is
          each piece of land worth? A Georgist would tell you that the two pieces of
          land
          are
          of equal value, but one is being put to its highest and best use, and the
          other probably is not.</p>
    </div>
  <p>But if you check the assessment rolls for your town, you may
          find that those two pieces of land bear very different assessments. Most
          likely, the lot that is being well used is going to be assessed much higher
          than the neighboring lot. Which means that the owner who has put his land
          to good use (creating jobs, a place to live or work for people) is being
          penalized for his industry, while the owner who sits and waits is being rewarded
          by a lower assessment.
</p>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Wait. It gets worse! In 49 states (the exception being <a href="Pennsylvania.html">Pennsylvania</a>),
          the millage rates on land and on buildings are identical. So in addition
          to paying more taxes on an identical piece of land, the fellow who is using
          his land well is also paying at the same rate on the building! Why on earth
          should a logical society do that?</p>
    <p>The alternative? </p>
    </div>
  <ul><li>
      <div align="left">
              First, get the assessments right. Value the
                        land first. Then value the entire property; the difference is the
                  depreciated value of the current improvement. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">
              Second, reduce the millage
                  rate on the buildings, and increase the millage rate on the land. (You'll
                  need to get
                            the enabling legislation first in the other 49 states, but this
                  change is worth the effort!)</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div align="left">What will happen? </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>First, the taxpayers, even large commercial ones, are far less
          likely to challenge their assessments because their assessments will be based
          first on land values, which are roughly comparable to those of the surrounding
          properties.</p>
    </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Second, the land value will begin to play a larger and larger
          role in determining the tax bill for the individual property. In the case
          of commercial properties, this replaces the income approach which tends to
          penalize the successful entrepreneur and reward the speculator. In older
          residential neighborhoods and commercial districts, this may send signals
          to owners of
          underdeveloped
          properties or those where the buildings are approaching obsolescence that
          it is time to consider redeveloping the sites. </p>
    <p>Third, instead of being forced to seek land on the fringe of
        town, those who want to locate a business will be able to afford a site downtown.
        The downtown will become more densely developed, putting the existing infrastructure
        to better use and preventing the need to extend sewers, water, electricity,
        cable TV and all the services the town provides into additional sprawl neighborhoods.
      People will not have to commute as far, business will improve, jobs will be
        created, housing will be created. </p>
    <p>What's wrong with this? Only that the joy goes out of land
        speculation. </p>

Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the tax mechanism provided the
incentive to speculators to buy land, not to use it in production but
to hold it for the rise. In this way, choice parcels remain undeveloped
or underdeveloped relative to the full extent that their values warrant
and development occurs instead in remote areas where opportunity for
profit is more immediate. The result was low density development what
we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To some people this may be counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Consider, however, the
possibility that there are two parcels of land in roughly the same
location and of equal size. You own a vacant parcel and another next to
it has a twenty-story building.</span> If only the land-value is taxed
you will be paying the same tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you
likely to do with your parcel? If you are rational, you will either
build a twenty-story building or else sell the land to someone who
will. In this way improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value
areas except where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park. ...<a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">read

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q56. Rich man with large mansion; poor widow with small house on same
      sized lot adjoining. The two pay the same tax. Is that right?</em><br>
A. There is no reason in justice why the community should not charge poor widows
as much for monopolizing valuable land as it charges rich men. In either case
it confers a special privilege and should be paid what the privilege is worth.
The question is seldom asked in good faith. Poor widows who live on lots adjoining
large mansions are not numerous, and when they exist they are simply land-grabbers.
In our sympathy for these widows, let us not forget the vast armies of widows
who not only do not live next to mansions, but have no place in the whole wide
world upon which to rest. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
