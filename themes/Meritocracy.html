<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>One of the things sometimes said about
  America is that it should be a meritocracy &#8212; that those who work hard
  deserve their success, and that all we really need to do is provide
  equal opportunity for all to succeed, through providing public
  education through high school at taxpayers' expense and making colleges
  available and some scholarship and loan aid to our young people whose
  families can't afford to pay for college costs themselves. </p>
  <p>But in most towns, there are individuals and corporations and absentees
    of various kinds who own the prime sites, and they get to collect rent &#8212;    rent
    on buildings (to which Georgists believe they are fully entitled) and rent
    on the location (to which Georgists believe the community is entitled).&nbsp; Then
    someone has to pay for the infrastructure and services which, with the natural
    amenities none of us can take credit for and the population growth to which
  we each contribute equally, help make the site valuable.&nbsp; So while we
  may tax land value a little, we also tax buildings (see: property tax is two
  taxes), and in many places we tax wages and other income, and even sales, in
  order
  to provide those publicly funded goods which serve to increase the locational
  rent that the tenant pays!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much better would be to tax land
  value more, and buildings, income and sales less or not at all.&nbsp; This
  would align justice and desirable incentives, and would actually reduce the
  amount that government needs to spend taking care of those who lack jobs sufficient
  to provide income to meet their own needs.</p>
  <p>Should the child of someone who owns a fabulously located piece of land
    have more advantages than the child of someone who must pay rent for their
    bit of land on the fringe? This is a different question from whether the
    child of the person who provides some valued service to others out of his
    own talents and effort should have more than the person who could work but
    doesn't. But we don't make that distinction nearly as clearly as
    we should,
    and it
    is an important difference. Land value taxation provides a way to collect
    back for the commons that which comes from the commons</p>

  Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
 Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A little Island or a little World</span><br>
    <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"></a>IMAGINE
  an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming in space.
  Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide the land,
  share and share alike, as individual property. At first, while
  population is sparse and industrial processes rude and primitive, this
  will work well enough.<br>
  <br>
  Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and look
  again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly multiplied;
  on the whole, population will have largely increased, and even
  supposing there have been no important inventions or improvements in
  the productive arts, the increase in population, by causing the
  division of labor, will have made industry more complex. During this
  time some of these people will have been careless, generous,
  improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some of them
  will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how they
  themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to inquiries
  and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond their
  little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
  pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
  trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
  fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many things
  which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human happiness,
  without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others again will have
  devoted all their energies to the extending of their possessions. What,
  then, shall we see, land having been all this time treated as private
  property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive equality has given
  way to inequality. Some will have very much more than one of the
  original shares into which the land was divided; very many will have no
  land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this, our little island
  or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are no wars or robberies;
  that the government is absolutely pure and taxes nominal; suppose, if
  you want to, any sort of a currency; imagine, if you can imagine such a
  world or island, that interest is utterly abolished; yet inequality in
  the ownership of land will have produced poverty and virtual slavery.<br>
  <br>
  For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to say, in
  their physical natures at least, they are animals who can live only on
  land and by the aid of the products of land. They may make machines
  which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps to fly in the
  air, but to build and equip these machines they must have land and the
  products of land, and must constantly come back to land. Therefore
  those who own the land must be the masters of the rest. Thus, if one
  man has come to own all the land, he is their absolute master even to
  life or death. If they can live on the land only on his terms, then
  they can live only on his terms, for without land they cannot live.
  They are his absolute slaves, and so long as his ownership is
  acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in everything as he
  wills.<br>
  <br>
  If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so far as
  to make one or a very few men the owners of all the land &#8211; if there are
  still so many landowners that there is competition between them as well
  as between those who have only their labor &#8211; then the terms on which
  these non-landholders can live will seem more like free contract. But
  it will not be free contract. Land can yield no wealth without the
  application of labor; labor can produce no wealth without land. These
  are the two equally necessary factors of production. Yet, to say that
  they are equally necessary factors of production is not to say that, in
  the making of contracts as to how the results of production are
  divided, the possessors of these two meet on equal terms. For the
  nature of these two factors is very different. Land is a natural
  element; the human being must have his stomach filled every few hours.
  Land can exist without labor, but labor cannot exist without land. If I
  own a piece of land, I can let it lie idle for a year or for years, and
  it will eat nothing. But the laborer must eat every day, and his family
  must eat. And so, in the making of terms between them, the landowner
  has an immense advantage over the laborer. It is on the side of the
  laborer that the intense pressure of competition comes, for in his case
  it is competition urged by hunger. And, further than this: As
  population increases, as the competition for the use of land becomes
  more and more intense, so are the owners of land enabled to get for the
  use of their land a larger and larger part of the wealth which labor
  exerted upon it produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily
  rises. Now, this steady rise in the value of land brings about a
  confident expectation of future increase of value, which produces among
  landowners all the effects of a combination to hold for higher prices.
  Thus there is a constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less
  and less or to give more and more (put it which way you please, it
  amounts to the same thing) of the products of their work for the
  opportunity to work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should
  see on our little island or our little world that, after a time had
  passed, some of the people would be able to take and enjoy a
  superabundance of all the fruits of labor without doing any labor at
  all, while others would be forced to work the livelong day for a
  pitiful living.<br>
  <br>
  But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
  suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the steam-engine,
  the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the reaping-machine, and the
  thousand and one labor-saving devices that are such a marked feature of
  our era. What would be the result?<br>
  <br>
  Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is to
  increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the same
  amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater amount with
  the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen the necessity
  for land. Until we can discover some way of making something out of
  nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as to be absolutely
  unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or invention which can
  lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And, this being the case, the
  effect of these labor-saving devices, land being the private property
  of some, would simply be to increase the proportion of the wealth
  produced that landowners could demand for the use of their land. The
  ultimate effect of these discoveries and inventions would be not to
  benefit the laborer, but to make him more dependent.<br>
  <br>
  And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving inventions
  to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to perfection.
  What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done away with, all
  the wealth that the land could produce would go entire to the
  landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one else. For
  the laborers there would be no use at all. If they continued to exist,
  it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of the landowners!... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it mean? Well,
      it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It does not merely
      mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway robbery! There are other
      forms of stealing which it prohibits as well. It certainly means (if it
    has any meaning) that we shall not take that to which we are not entitled,
    to
      the detriment of
  others.</p>
  <p>Now, here is a desert. Here is a caravan
    going along over the desert. Here is a gang of robbers.
    They say: "Look! There is a rich caravan; let us go and rob it, kill the men
    if necessary, take their goods from them, their camels and
    horses, and walk off." But one of the robbers says:&nbsp; "Oh, no; that is dangerous;
    besides, that would be stealing! Let us, instead of doing that, go ahead to where
    there is a spring, the only spring at which this caravan can get water in this
    desert. Let us put a wall around it and call it ours, and when they come up we
    won&#8217;t let them have any water until they have given us all the goods they
    have." That would be more gentlemanly, more polite, and more respectable;
    but would it not be theft all the same? And is it not theft of the same kind
    when people go ahead in advance of population and get land they have no use
    whatever
    for, and then, as people come into the world and population increases, will
    not let
    this increasing population use the land until they pay an exorbitant
    price?
  </p>
  <p><strong>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are founded.
        Do that under the false code of morality which exists here today and people
        will praise
      your forethought and your enterprise, and will say you have made money because
      you are a very superior person, and that all can make money if they will only
      work and be industrious! But is it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou
      shalt not steal," as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</strong></p>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we ourselves must not
      steal. But does it not also mean that we must not suffer anybody else to
      steal if we can help it?</p>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not suffer thyself
      or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we, all of us, rich
      and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime that produces poverty.
      Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212; they are not to blame
      above anyone else, but we who permit them to monopolize land are also parties
      to the theft.<b> </b>... <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">read the whole article </a></p>

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">Painless Taxation</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
  <p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
    taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
    streams necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>
          2) upon our labor, or <br>
    3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
    of these parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is
    counted in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of
    capital (its liquid form) is in interest.</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
      people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and
    taxing buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists
    as well
      as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
      to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
      discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of
    a tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
      of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
      But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
      of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
      rather land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base
      of all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result
      of
      being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where
      community demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation
      of that land's
      price. <strong>To be sure many people have learned to position themselves
      in situations where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed
      these people come to think of themselves as astute investors. </strong>But
      the fact is that that market gain is not of their own doing at all; it
      is the result of common
      enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
      in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser
      degree. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
