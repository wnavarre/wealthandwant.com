  <p>Is population density a bad thing? Many people's instant reaction is to
    answer yes to that. And obviously, not everyone wants to live in or near
    a city. Yet for many of us, urban living, with all the amenities that a
    dense population provides, is a wonderful thing. Many of us would rather
    live close to those
    amenities  than spend an hour, or two &#8212; or more &#8212; commuting from
    land we can afford
      to sites where wages are high enough to provide a living. </p>
  <p>With population growth comes an increase in rent. That increase in rent
    can be used to make a few landholders extremely wealthy (in the form of annual
    rent payments that are mostly for location rather than a return on the building
    and the services they provide, or in the form of appreciation on a property
    when they choose to sell it), or it can be used to fund the services which
    make living in a city pleasant: good
    public
    transportation,
    good schools, good emergency services, parks, libraries, etc. Which plan

    Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving Life to
    the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... </small><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? Environmentalists should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine. Since about one-fifth of urban areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth. While suburban commercial centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many
people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of <em>automobiles</em>, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse. ...<br>
<br>
</small></font><small><font size="3"><small>What's won or lost is a
value generated by
society. That is, land rises in value 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where a new resource is
discovered (during a gold rush, more money is made by land developers
than by prospectors), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where population grows (see the Sun
Belt and
verdant Northwest), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where technology advances (witness
the land values
in the various Silicon Valleys, Forests, etc), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where infrastructure
expands (e.g., near a new road or sewer), and 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where society cooperates
(e.g., in communities that organize street fairs, neighborhood watches,
etc). 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>These factors driving land value are not
improvements made by
lone owners but by the entire community. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The closest correlation to
land value is density and no one person creates that. </span>Hence the
site
value levy merely puts public values in the public treasury for public
benefit, as untaxing homes, sales, and income leaves
privately-generated values in private pockets. ...</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html">How Profit
Shapes Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Like the rest of the universe, US
cities keep expanding. Some time before the
universe begins to contract, American metro
regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck
suburbia back into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most
fundamental forces in the world - money.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of
downtown.
The usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our
present dependency on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to
bring people back.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small> Post-PTS, would these speculators
turned developers
find customers? Or would potential
customers continue
to set up shop and home out in the
cheaper 'burbs?
Many house-hunters are drawn to where
all the
amenities are in walking distance.
Many shopkeepers
locate where people walk about. Other
businesses
collect themselves close to their
suppliers and
customers. There are plenty of takers
for new
downtown development.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> At least that's what land values tell
us. Land values
merely reflect the desirability of
locations. The more
people want on, the more they must
pay. The lots that
people are willing to pay the most for
are the heart of
the city.
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> As does nature, her
defenders might also
want to abhor a vacuum.<strong> "Letting one city block lie
fallow means paving
over many suburban
acres," calculates Gaffney, consultant
to Alaska on oil
royalties. "Conversely, using one
block intensely means
many outlying acres need not be used
at all." The
biggest gain in saving suburban land
comes from using
urban land more efficiently.</strong> <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small> This property tax shift (PTS) "helps
cities recover from
auto-dependency," notes Gihring,
author of The Journal
of the American Planning
Association&#8217;s first article on
revenue reform (1999 Winter). The PTS
turns lots for
cars into structures for people. By
densifying a city, it
provides more riders for mass transit,
justifying more
routes and times. As riding becomes
convenient while
remaining a bargain, and parking grows
inconvenient
while rising in cost, more people
switch from driving to
riding. Less traffic lets cities
transform streets for bikes,
pedestrians, sidewalk cafes, and
street performers.&nbsp;<strong>
... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> In New York, the city council keeps
Manhattan&#8217;s Central
Park unbuilt not because Greens rule
the Big Apple but
because property values overall are
higher with the park
than with luxury condos on the site.
Land value is at its
maximum when land use is at its
optimum - mixed use
including non-use. Batt adds, "the
higher land value is,
the more revenue there is for public
benefit. Limiting a
locality&#8217;s funding sources to
land value puts
government squarely on the side of the
land&#8217;s health."&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site
Rent and Transportation Costs
Linked</span><br>
Higher density development has all the economies of scale, savings in
cost, reduction in externalities, dividends in community and political
enhancement, and benefits to urban areas that we all say that we want.
The greater the proximity to points of desirable accessibility, the
lower are typically the transportation costs. Conversely, sites remote
from the urban centers of greatest locational value will have higher
transportation costs. When the fixed costs of transportation
infrastructure and parcel site improvements are accounted for (which
tend to be relatively the same regardless of location), one is left
with the marginal costs of operations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)&nbsp; </span><strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
This relationship has been demonstrated more empirically in a recent
study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
Portland Oregon,<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>each additional mile [traveled]
translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
in new home value.</small><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>For a household in which one
worker
drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><br>
That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles.
If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span>
The American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000
miles in 2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span> Even
that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
on to society. One study calculated that the total costs of motor
vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span> In
1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
costs to society were ten times that;<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span> put
another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span><strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
... Developing land use and transportation patterns that assume
walkability
or transit service rather than individual and private motor vehicles is
the very definition of livability. Experts agree that the minimum
density necessary to make public transit services economically viable
is 10 to 12 households per acre, although cities developed in the
post-automobile era, lamentably, one sees very little prospect of
altering automobile dependency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(36)</span> One
study found that "the range of costs induced by spread-out development,
. . [i.e.] houses built in sprawling developments, may cost 40 to 400
percent more to serve than if they were located close to major
facilities, were clustered in continuous areas, and in corporate a
variety of housing types."</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(37)</span> But
by bringing prices into line with costs, both on the transportation
services side and on the site-rent side, it is possible both to foster
those personal choice calculations that are consistent with sustainable
urban environments. ... </small><a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html"><span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To some people this may be
counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Jessica Matthews, now with the
Council on Foreign Relations,
recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a now familiar
sequence, developers reach for the
cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in
behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage systems and
schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are
left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily
outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because residential development
can't meet the public bills, local
governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
providing an incentive for new development.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Years of such leap-frogging
construction devours land at an
astonishing pace. Now if the full social opportunity cost of land
occupancy were charged to landholders, the reward of (and incentive
for) speculation would be obliterated, and land now locked up by
speculators would be transferred to users. Users would employ more
labor and engender more capital development instead of seeing it
locked up in wasted space.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Absent adequate taxation the
regions at the periphery are the
first developed, just as Ms. Matthews observes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economics profession is only
now coming to recognize its
responsibility for what it has wrought. Economists are coming to
recognize the costs of sprawl, and studies show how astonishingly
inefficient the suburban lifestyle is. One review of the literature
on the subject of comparative development costs published by the
Urban Land Institute revealed that "houses built in sprawling
developments may cost 40 to 400 percent more to serve than if they
were located close to major facilities, were clustered in contiguous
areas, and incorporated a variety of housing types."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Transportation planners know that
public transit typically takes a
density of at least 8-10 households per acre in order for it to be
economically viable. Because tax policies have been instituted that
have the effect of deliberately fostering low density suburban
sprawl, society has become dependent upon motor vehicle
transportation rather than transit service. Had taxes been imposed
heavily or solely upon land value, just the opposite would have
occurred: development would have been most intense on the high
land-value parcels, right by the transit services, making our society
less dependent upon motor vehicles.... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>The collection of
land rent has other consequences for the smooth and
effective functioning of the economy as well. With respect to the
configurations of land use in urban areas, the collect of land rent
neutralizes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces which the
current real property tax (i.e. that on both land and improvements)
exerts on the values of locational sites. In fact one eminent economist
argues that a tax on land sites is &#8220;better than neutral,&#8221; because it
fosters activity in the highest value areas and removes the factor of
adverse timing that often stalls economic investment.</big><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small> This
all leads to the economic vitality of high-land-value cities, simply by
virtue of concentrating activity in central areas instead of peripheral
and remote regions. It discourages the extravagant and careless
development of land sites,
thereby also fostering development densities conducive to community
welfare and to the success of public transit services.<small><span

And given the widespread environmentally and socially destructive
consequences of motor vehicle dependency, collecting rent is half the
answer toward the goal of engendering livable urban areas. (The other
half &#8212; see below &#8212; is pricing motor vehicle use at its true marginal

  <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
      The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my

fleeing." Yet, these are not ghosts, nor autumn leaves in the west
wind; these are live people. Destroy man's habitat here and he moves
it there, and takes habitat from other life forms. The solutions to
urban decay and disintegration are infilling and renewal. Here is
where the Green Light Tax is such a good management tool. It lets
cities rebuild themselves without tax penalties on new building, and
rise like the phoenix from their own ashes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a reflex against growth
and development we must learn to
overcome. "Growth" should not be an issue to divide us: it depends on
the kind of growth. Resentment of growth and development stems in
large part from associating them with territorial expansion.
Infilling and renewal and rehab, however, UNCOUPLE growth from
sprawl: they let cities grow (or at least stop shrinking) without
sprawling. Ascending to a satellite view, let's look at the whole
system of settlement: focusing people where they should be keeps them
away from where they shouldn't be.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is an aerial view of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, a state
dominated by owners of million-acre ranches, and therefore with about
the lowest property tax rate in the U.S. Albuquerque sprawls out
about 30 miles east-west, and another 30 miles north-south, giving a
density of about 300-400 people per square mile for its 330,000
residents. Many of its homes are slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Contrast that with the aerial view
of Sydney, Australia, a city
that raises a lot of its budget from "Green Light" taxes on site
value. Sydney and suburbs have nearly 3 million people, on less land
than Albuquerque, and with no slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is plenty of land to go
around.</b> The pleasant green
villages of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin are upper-income
Milwaukee suburbs that feature detached homes on tree-lined streets,
with detached garages, laws against overnight curb parking, a number
of lakeshore mansions with parklike grounds, ample public parks, good
shopping, and a little industry. Their densities are 10,000 persons
per square mile. At this density, 250 million Americans would fit
nicely into less than half of Wisconsin, an average-sized one of 50
states. (They would occupy 0.7% of the United States.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the 10,000 density, Greater
Milwaukee would fit inside
Milwaukee County, yet it now sprawls out over several counties. It
sprawls farther yet if one counts the rural residents who float in
and out of town for seasonal work. Shorewood and Whitefish Bay have
high density because they are the only Milwaukee suburbs with no
vacant land; the others, and the central city itself, are full of
holes. <b>Result: sprawl, invasion of wildlands, loss of farmland,
forced automobilization of former pedestrians, water pollution from
new grading - the whole litany of green laments. High density is not
their cause, but their cure.&nbsp; </b>... <a

  Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">Economics in
Support of Environmentalism</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Sometimes the rich take land from the poor, provoking sympathy, strong
    rhetoric, and occasionally effective rear-guard resistance to
such changes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actually, a well-oiled market
is often quite democratic. People of moderate income, by crowding, can outcompete
those of high income for the same land</span>, as when a Sears or Wal-mart takes
the best commercial sites from a Nordstroms or Broadway; or when an old estate
is subdivided into five lots per acre. This, too, provokes negative rhetoric,
but developers know how to make hay out of this, and mincemeat of their opposition.
At this point developers become populists and accuse preservationists and environmentalists
of snobbery and elitism. We need an answer for that one if environmentalists
are going to command enough popular support to win, and hold the gains. Of this,
more later. ... </p>
  <p><b>Leapfrogging,
      floating value, and compensation</b>  </p>
  <p>The environmental damage from those attitudes might not be so bad
      were it not for leapfrogging, urban disintegration, and floating
      value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging is when
      developers jump over the next eligible
      lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there.
      </span>This has been a problem in expanding economies ever since cities
      emerged from within their ancient walls and stockades, but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in our
      times and our country it has gone to unprecedented extremes, with
      subsidized superhighways and universal auto ownership and truck
      shipping.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred Gobar, savvy real estate
      consultant from Placentia, has
      recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
      dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
      U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
      miles). </span>That would be at a density of 3625 people per square
      mile, or
      5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
      gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He is not being stingy with land,
      at 3625 persons per square mile.</span>
    The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
      mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
      baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
      and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
      well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
      generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
      retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
      liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
      in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
      military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
      etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
      mile.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On Manhattan's upper East Side they
      pile up at over 100,000 per
      square mile. </span>They do not crowd like this out of desperation,
      either.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may think of rats in
      cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
      people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
      pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
      all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
      umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
      others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
    they actually like it there!</span></p>
  <p>Take 10,000 per square mile as a reference figure, because it is
      easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
      You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
      Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
      with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
      land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
      Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
      United States.</p>
  <p>And yet, the urban price influence of Los Angeles extends over 89
      miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
      which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
      Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
      actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
      imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
      their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public," meaning
      other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</p>
  <p>If their land is downzoned for farming, open space, or habitat,
      they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
      buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
      owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
      to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
      its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
      yet.</p>
  <p>Here is a case showing how this works. The Los Angeles
      Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
      northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
      of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
      interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
      owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
      invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
    and condemned the land. The case
      went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
      twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
      that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
      central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
      landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></p>
  <p><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i> to SP to help subsidize
          mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
          Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
          welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
          taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
          increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
          create in the future.</b></p>
  <p>Later, MTA was to stint on subway construction, resulting in
      subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
      paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
    <b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
      property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
      a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
      national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
      acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
      through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
    token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.</b>... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><span
