        Land Question</a> (1881)</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
        <p>Either the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the Irish
          landlords, or it rightfully belongs to the Irish people; there can be
          no middle ground. If it rightfully belongs to the landlords, then is
          the whole agitation wrong, and every scheme for interfering in any
          way with the landlords is condemned. If the land rightfully belongs
          to the landlords, then it is nobody else's business what they do with
          it, or what rent they charge for it, or where or how they spend the
          money they draw from it, and whoever does not want to live upon it on
          the landlords' terms is at perfect liberty to starve or emigrate. But
          if, on the contrary, the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the
          Irish people, then the only logical demand is, not that the tenants
          shall be made joint owners with the landlords, not that it be bought
          from a smaller class and sold to a larger class, but that it be
          resumed by the whole people. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To
          propose to pay the landlords for it
          is to deny the right of the people to it.</span> The real fight for
          Irish
          rights must he made outside of Ireland; and, above all things, the
          Irish agitators ought to take a logical position, based upon a broad,
          clear principle which can be everywhere understood and appreciated.
          To ask for tenant-right or peasant proprietorship is not to take such
          a position; to concede that the landlords ought to be paid is utterly
          to abandon the principle that the land belongs rightfully to the
        people.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To admit, as even the most radical
          of the Irish agitators seem to
          admit, that the landlords should be paid the value of their lands, is
          to deny the rights of the people. It is an admission that the
          agitation is an interference with the just rights of property.</span>
          It is
          to ignore the only principle on which the agitation can be justified,
          and on which it can gather strength for the accomplishment of
          anything real and permanent. To admit this is to admit that the Irish
          people have no more right to the soil of Ireland than any outsider.
          For, any outsider can go to Ireland and buy land, if he will give its
          market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To propose to
          buy out the landlords is to propose to
          continue the present injustice in another form. They would get in
          interest on the debt created what they now get in rent. They would
        still have a lien upon Irish labor.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">And why should the landlords be
          paid? If the land of Ireland
          belongs of natural right to the Irish people, what valid claim for
          payment can be set up by the landlords?</span> No one will contend that
          the
          land is theirs of natural right, for the day has gone by when men
          could be told that the Creator of the universe intended his bounty
          for the exclusive use and benefit of a privileged class of his
          creatures &#8211; that he intended a few to roll in luxury while their
          fellows toiled and starved for them. The claim of the landlords to
          the land rests not on natural right, but merely on municipal
          law &#8211; on municipal law which contravenes natural right. And,
          whenever the sovereign power changes municipal law so as to conform
          to natural right, what claim can they assert to compensation? Some of
          them bought their lands, it is true; but they got no better title
          than the seller had to give. And what are these titles? Titles based
          on murder and robbery, on blood and rapine&#8211;titles which rest on
          the most atrocious and wholesale crimes. Created by force and
          maintained by force, they have not behind them the first shadow of
          right. That Henry II and James I and Cromwell and the Long Parliament
          had the power to give and grant Irish lands is true; but will any one
          contend they had the right? Will any one contend that in all the past
          generations there has existed on the British Isles or anywhere else
          any human being, or any number of human beings, who had the right to
          say that in the year 1881 the great mass of Irishmen should be
          compelled to pay &#8211; in many cases to residents of England, France,
          or the United States &#8211; for the privilege of living in their native
          country and making a living from their native soil? Even if it be
          said that might makes right; even if it be contended that in the
          twelfth, or seventeenth, or eighteenth century lived men who, having
          the power, had therefore the right, to give away the soil of Ireland,
          it cannot be contended that their right went further than their
          power, or that their gifts and grants are binding on the men of the
          present generation. No one can urge such a preposterous doctrine.
          And, if might makes right, then the moment the people get power to
          take the land the rights of the present landholders utterly cease,
          and any proposal to compensate them is a proposal to do a fresh
        wrong. <strong>.... </strong></p>
        <p>Consider: is not the parallel I have drawn a true one? Is it not
          just as much a perversion of ideas to apply the doctrine of vested
          rights to property in land, when these are its admitted fruits, as it
          was to apply it to property in human flesh and blood; as it would be
          to apply it to the business of piracy? In what does the claim of the
          Irish landholders differ from that of the hereditary pirate or the
          man who has bought out a piratical business? "Because I have
          inherited or purchased the business of robbing merchantmen," says the
          pirate, "therefore respect for the rights of property must compel you
          to let me go on robbing ships and making sailors walk the plank until
          you buy me out." "Because we have inherited or purchased the
          privilege of appropriating to ourselves the lion's share of the
          produce of labor," says the landlord, "therefore you must continue to
          let us do it, even though poor wretches shiver with cold and faint
          with hunger, even though, in their poverty and misery, they are
        reduced to wallow with the pigs." What is the difference?</p>
        <p>This is the point I want to make clearly and distinctly, for it
          shows a distinction that in current thought is overlooked. Property
          in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different from
          property in things that are the result of labor. Rob a man or a
          people of money, or goods, or cattle, and the robbery is finished
          there and then. The lapse of time does not, indeed, change wrong into
          right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed. That is done; it
          is over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away into the
          past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing
          save omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it
          we would be in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever
          beyond us. We can neither punish nor recompense the dead. But rob a
          people of the land on which they must live, and the robbery is
          continuous. It is a fresh robbery of every succeeding
          generation&#8211;a new robbery every year and every day; it is like
          the robbery which condemns to slavery the children of the slave. To
          apply to it the statute of limitations, to acknowledge for it the
          title of prescription, is not to condone the past; it is to legalize
          robbery in the present, to justify it in the future. The indictment
          which really lies against the Irish landlords is not that their
          ancestors, or the ancestors of their grantors, robbed the ancestors
          of the Irish people. That makes no difference. "Let the dead bury
          their dead." The indictment that truly lies is that here, now, in the
          year 1881, they rob the Irish people. And shall we be told that there
        can be a vested right to continue such robbery?... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<p>  Henry George: <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">In Liverpool: The Financial
      Reform Meeting at the Liverpool Rotunda </a>(1889)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The People who say that such terrible things would follow the institution
      of the single tax are simply like the people who had predicted terrible
    things to follow the building of railroads and the abolition of chattel slavery.
    Why
      I remember, and Mr. Garrison well remembers, the day when in the United
    States all the arguments that are used in this country against the single
    tax were
      used against the abolition of chattel slavery, even down to the &quot;poor
      widow argument.&quot;</p>
  <p>We used to be told &#8212; I was only a boy then &#8212; we used to be told,
      when William Lloyd Garrison, father of this man, was the best denounced man
      on two continents, that it might be well if we could find the people who originally
      brought these slaves from Africa, to make them give them up. &quot;But,&quot; it
      was urged, &quot;these negroes are owned by people who paid their money for
      them. (Laughter) Would you take away from a man without any compensation the
      property that he bought?&quot; (Laughter) Then we used to be told, as you are
      told now, about that hard working mechanic. &quot;Here is a hard working laboring
      man. He has toiled early and late, and he has bought a slave to help him. Are
      you going to take a man's slave without compensation and rob him of the products
      of his labor?&quot; (Laughter) So they say today of the English mechanic, or
      English laborer, who has bought himself a little bit of land. And then we used
      to be told: &quot;Here is a man who worked hard and saved his money, and he
      invested in half-a-dozen slaves. He died, and those slaves are the only means
      of subsistence the widow has to support his orphan children. Would you emancipate
      those slaves, and let that poor widow and those little orphans starve to death?&quot; (Laughter)</p>
  <p>Slavery and Slavery</p>
  <p>It is the old, old story! And no wonder, for property in land is just as
    absurd! just as monstrous as property in human beings. (Hear, hear, and cheers)
    What
      difference does it make whether you enslave a man by making his flesh and
    blood the property of another, or whether you enslave him by making the property
      of another that element on which and from which he must live if he is to
    live
      at all? (A voice: &quot;None whatever!&quot; and cheers)</p>
  <p>Why, in those old days slave ships used to set out from this town of Liverpool
      for the coast of Africa to buy slaves. They did not bring them to Liverpool;
      they took them over to America. Why? Because you people were so good, and
    the Englishmen who had got to the other side of the Atlantic, and had settled
    there,
      were so bad? Not at all. I will tell you why the Liverpool ships carried
    slaves to America and did not bring them back to England. Because in America
    population
      was sparse and land was plentiful. Therefore to rob a man of his labor &#8212; and
      that is what the slaveowner wanted the slave for &#8212; you had got to catch
      and hold the man. That is the reason the slaves went to America. The reason
      they did not come here, the reason they were not carried over to Ireland was
      that here population was relatively dense, land was relatively scarce and could
      easily be monopolized, and to get out of the laborer all that his labor could
      furnish, save only wages enough to keep him alive even the slaveowner had to
      give this &#8212; it was only necessary to own land. ... <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.

  <p><strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
      not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take
      the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
  <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
    indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
    want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
    of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
    you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
    of land.</p>
  <p>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from nature,
    not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership with possession
    and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
    property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any
    other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
    in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
    to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that
    it came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
    man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively
    to him or to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property,
    which originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
    of the thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
    so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice
    to the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
    They do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is
    but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
    labor.</p>
  <p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any grant from
    the Maker of land? What does nature give to such ownership? how does she
    in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
    of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
    their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and
    another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from
    man and passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression
    of his labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the
    individual; but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed
    before man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men
    come and go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man
    for &#8220;the daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?</p>
  <p>      <strong>Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state,
      not from nature. Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score
      of morals when it
      is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as
        it is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice
      on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
      of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value
      of landownership for the use of the community, the real injustice is in
      leaving it in private
    hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</strong></p>
  <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
    for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
    God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited of
    their natural rights can be restored to them, the present owners of land
    shall first be compensated.</p>
  <p>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and largely
    benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists are
    much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though the great
    landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general among whom the
    profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges,
    etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers in
    the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly, more strongly,
    more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or losses would your
    duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you to listen for one moment
    to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
  <p><strong>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just
      that those whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners
      would
    be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
    alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim
    to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the
    same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest
    of what they before got as rent. </strong>Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice
    are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that land is
    really the storehouse that God owes to all his children, you will no more
    listen to any demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses
    would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before
    letting the children of Israel go.</p>
  <p><strong>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken?
      The demand of landowners for compensation is not that.</strong> We do not
      seek to spoil the Egyptians. We do not ask that what has been unjustly
      taken from laborers shall be restored.
    We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to
    bury their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of
    land values have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus
    got. <strong>We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor
    shall cease &#8212; that
    for the future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community

    Nothing at all. That he purchased in good faith gives him no right or claim

    compensation" to the innocent purchaser. The law does not say, as John Stuart
    Mill says: "The land belongs to A, therefore B who has thought himself the
    owner has no right to anything but the rent, or compensation for its salable
    value." For that would be indeed like a famous fugitive slave case decision
    in which the Court was said to have given the law to the North and the nigger
    to the South. The law simply says: "The land belongs to A, let the Sheriff
    put him in possession! " &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book

COMPENSATED for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
of land-owners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
We are willing that bygones should be bygones, and to leave dead wrongs to bury
their dead. We propose to let those who, by the past appropriation of land-value,
have taken the fruits of labor, retain what they have thus got. We merely propose
that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease. &#8212; NOW, is the State
called on to compensate men for the failure of their expectations as to its action,
even where no moral element is involved? If it make peace, must it compensate
those who have invested on the expectation of war. If it open a shorter highway,
is it morally bound to compensate those who may lose by the diversion of travel
from the old one? If it promote the discovery of a cheap means of producing electricity
directly from heat, is it morally bound to compensate the owners of all the steam
engines thereby thrown out of use and all who are engaged in making them? If
it develop the air-ship, must it compensate those whose business would be injured?
Such a contention would be absurd. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
Condition of Labor</a><br>
          <br>
Yet the contention we are considering is worse. It is that the State must compensate
for disappointing the expectations of those who have counted on its continuing
to do wrong. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A Perplexed

            <br>
COMPENSATION implies equivalence. To compensate for the discontinuance of a wrong
is to give those who profit by the wrong the pecuniary equivalent of its continuance.
Now the State has nothing that does not belong to the individuals who compose
it. What it gives to some it must take from others. Abolition with compensation
is therefore not really abolition, but continuance under a different form &#8212; on
one side of unjust deprivation, and on the other side of unjust appropriation. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

  <p>"CAVEAT emptor" is the maxim of the law &#8212; "Let the buyer beware!" If
    a man buys a structure in which the law of gravity is disregarded or mechanical
    laws ignored, he takes the risk of those laws asserting their sway. And so
    he takes the risk in buying property which contravenes the moral law. When
    he ignores the moral sense, when he gambles on the continuance of a wrong,
    and when at last the general conscience rises to the point of refusing to
    continue that wrong, can he then claim that those who have refrained from
    taking part in it, those who have suffered from it, those who have borne
    the burden and heat and contumely of first moving against it, shall share
    in his losses on the ground that as members of the same state they are equally
    responsible for it? And must not the acceptance of this impudent plea tend
    to prevent that gradual weakening and dying out of the wrong, which would
    otherwise occur as the rise of the moral sense against it lessened the prospect
    of its continuance; and by promise of insurance to investors tend to maintain
    it in strength and energy till the last minute? &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

ALL pleas for compensation on the abolition of unequal rights to land are excuses
for avoiding right and continuing wrong; they all, as fully as the original wrong,
deny that equalness which is the essential of justice. Where they have seemed
plausible to any honestly-minded man, he will, if he really examines his thought,
see that this has been so because he has, though perhaps unconsciously, entertained
a sympathy for those who seem to profit by injustice which he has refused to
those who have been injured by it. He has been thinking of the few whose incomes
would be cut off by the restoration of equal right. He has forgotten the many,
who are being impoverished, degraded, and driven out of life by its denial. If
he once breaks through the tyranny of accustomed ideas and truly realizes that
all men are equally entitled to the use of the natural opportunities for the
living of their lives and the development of their powers, he will see the injustice,
the wickedness, of demanding compensation for the abolition of the monopoly of
land. He will see that if anyone is to be compensated on the abolition of a wrong,
it is those who have suffered by the wrong, not those who have profited by it. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

<p>Louis Post: <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
      Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
      FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q60. If the value of land be destroyed by the single tax, would not justice
    require that land-owners be compensated?</em><br>
    A. No. Land is given for the use of all, and rent is produced by the community
    as a whole. To legally vest land-ownership in less than the whole, excluding
    those to come as well as those that are here, is a moral crime against all
    who are excluded. Therefore no government can make a perpetual title to land
    which is or can become morally binding. Neither can one generation vest the
    communal earnings of future generations in particular persons by any morally
    valid title, as they certainly attempt to do when they make grants of land.
    There is both divine justice and economic wisdom in the command that &quot;the
    land shall not be sold in perpetuity.&quot; In the forum of morals all titles
    to land are subject to absolute divestment as soon as the people decide upon
    the change.</p>
  <p><em>Q61. If a man buys land in good faith, under the laws under which we live,
    is he not entitled to compensation for his individual loss when titles are
    abolished?</em><br>
    A. There is no sounder principle of law than that which, distinguishing the
    contractual from the legislative powers of government, prescribes that government
    cannot tie up its legislative powers. Now, land tenures and taxation are
    so clearly matters of general public policy that no one would deny that they
    are legislative and not contractual in character. It follows that titles
    to land, and privileges of more or less exemption from taxation, are voidable
    at the pleasure of the people. And the possibility of such action on the
    part of the people is as truly a part of every grant of land as if it were
    written expressly in the body of the instrument. Moreover, notice was given
    when Henry George published &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; and has been
    reiterated often since in louder and louder tones until the whole civilized
    world has become cognizant of it, that an effort is in progress to do what
    is in effect this very thing. That notice is a moral cloud upon every title,
    and he who buys now buys with notice. It will not do for him when the time
    comes, to say: &quot;I relied upon the good faith of the government whose
    laws told me I might buy.&quot; He has notice, and if he buys he buys at
    his peril. Men cannot be allowed to make bets that the effort to retain land
    values for common use will fail, and then when they lose their bets call
    upon the people to compensate them for the loss. Read the chapter on &quot;Compensation&quot; in

      will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference. The right to
      possess
      and to pass on the ownership of things that in their nature decay and soon
      cease to be is a very different thing from the right to possess and to
      pass on the ownership of that which does not decay, but from which each
      successive
      generation must live.</p>
  <p>To show how this difference between land and such other species of property
      as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for the vested rights
      of landholders, let me illustrate again.</p>
  <p> Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a business of sailing the seas, capturing
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes.
    In this way he accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried.
    But let us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
    his wealth,
    but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs and so on, until
    at the present day this wealth or a part of it has come to a great-great-grandson
    of
    Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
    that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the shipmasters whom
    Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says: "This man's great-great-grandfather
    plundered my great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which
    have been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would have
    been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
    restore them." What would society answer?  </p>
  <p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with principles
    recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We cannot entertain such
    a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's great-great-grandfather robbed your
    great-great-grandfather, and that as the result of this wrong he has got
    things that otherwise might have come to you. But we cannot inquire into
    occurrences
    that happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to
    its own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the controversies
    of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless disputes and pretexts
    for dispute. What you say may be true, but somewhere we must draw the line,
    and have an end to strife. Though this man's great-great-grandfather may
    have
    robbed your great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into
    possession of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully, and
    we must take
    this peaceful possession, when it has been continued for a certain time,
    as absolute evidence of just title; for, were we not to do that, there would
    be
    no end to dispute and no secure possession of anything."</p>
  <p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the statute
    of limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> This is the reason why it is held &#8211; and as
      to most things held justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for
      a certain time cures all defects of title.</span></p>
  <p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
  <p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and profitable
    piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son, and so on, until
    the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has come to consider it the most
    natural thing in the world that his ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much
    plunder, whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
    great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to work. But
    at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having their ships sunk
    and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of trembling for their lives every
    time a sail lifts above the horizon, and they demand of society that piracy
    be stopped.</p>
  <p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed to the
    doctrine of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound to prevent
    any interference
      with the business that he had inherited, and that, if it wanted him to
    stop, it must buy him out, paying him all that his business was worth&#8211;that
      is to say, at least as much as he could make in twenty years' successful
    pirating, so that if he stopped pirating he could still continue to live
    in luxury off
      of the profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
  <p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be but one answer.
    We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd that his was a business to
    which the statute of limitations and the doctrine of vested rights did not
    apply; that because his father, and his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather
    pursued the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the plank,
    was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it. Society, we will all
    agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy and stop it at once, and that
    without getting a cent for stopping.</p>
  <p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his piratical business
    to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree that society ought to say that
    their purchase of the business gave them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
  <p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe, I do not
    ask what society would say.</p>
  <p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied that,
    under the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for a long time
    say what
      we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would all the Kidds loudly claim
    that to make them give up their business without full recompense would be
    a wicked
      interference with vested rights, but the justice of this claim would at
    first be assumed as a matter of course by all or nearly all the influential
    classes&#8211;the
      great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for the magazines, the
    eloquent clergymen, and the principal professors in the principal universities.
    Nay,
      even the merchants and sailors, when they first began to complain, would
    be so tyrannized and browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly
      think of more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there
    any
      one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and without
      compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being stigmatized as
    a reckless disturber and wicked foe of social order.</p>
  <p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such fools, then I
    appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
  <p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any people,
    became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to you the truth of
    what I say. ...</p>
  <p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is not long since
    the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly respectable business, affording
    as legitimate an opening for the investment of capital and the display of enterprise
    as any other. The proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous,
    then as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very Constitution
    bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law of the nation, adopted
    twelve years after the enunciation of the Declaration of Independence, declare
    that for twenty years the slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted?
    Such dominion had the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who
    had already proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

  <p>... Furthermore, he has built on these parcels a barn and two storehouses.</p>
  <p>The method of computing the proper selling price under such circumstances
      would have to be the result of experience, but <strong>that price would
      certainly include the present value of the improvements and probably some
      lump sum besides, as
      compensation for loss of farming opportunity. </strong>But just as certainly
      it would not include, (as it would do under our present conditions), the
      increased location
      value which the town itself has created by its own growth and public works,
      and which in all justice belongs to the town or community and not to the
      individual. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
    <p>But again the voice of the objector is heard, possibly to this effect: &quot;This
        plan may be all right for the community, but how about poor Mr. Rhinelastor?&quot;</p>
    <p>In reality the landowner would not suffer so much from the restoration of
          the public revenue as might at first appear. For one thing, whereas he is now
          taxed, at least in theory, not only on land, but on buildings, cash, bonds,
          and all other personal property, and perhaps on his income as well, he would
          then have no taxes at all to pay. Furthermore the economic rent is not the
          full measure of the possible earning capacity of the land, but will always
        be less than the offerer expects to make out of its use.</p>
    <p>Again, while it must be firmly insisted that the economic rent is the rightful
          property of the community and not of the landowner, the community would probably
          never take it all. Communal ownership of land is not desirable, even if it
          were practicable. Individual ownership and management are best, and it is not
          at all improper for the community to allow the owner something for caring for
          the land to which he holds title, and for collecting and transmitting to the
        treasury the economic rent.</p>
    <p>But &#8212; and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
          of taxation &#8212; Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return
          from his land, must improve it. Unless he is satisfied with a small income
          from
          it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the community chooses
          to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best building the
          location will warrant. The rents of this building will be his in their
          entirety, not
          one dollar of them being taken from him by taxation. If he is not prepared
          or not willing to do this he would probably find it more profitable, before
          he leaves the country, to sell the land to some one of the many persons
          who are eager to build upon it. It will always be salable, although not
          by any
        means at present figures.</p>
    <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
          the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
          policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium is placed
          upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy penalty
          is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
          depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
        with the land.</p>
    <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put up
          a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin which
          now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and while paying
          a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby enabled
          to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
          is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
          amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
          and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
          letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
        till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it?</p>
    <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
          making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it from
        the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.</p>
    <p>Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better
          and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores, more employment
          for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
          an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a public
        revenue adequate to all real public needs.</p>

          of individual landowners ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>HOW can you remedy it? Only by
going to first principles. only by
asserting the natural rights of man. You cannot do it by any such
scheme as is proposed here of buying out the landlords and selling
again to the tenant farmers. What good is that going to do to the
laborers? What benefit is it to be to the artisans of the city? And
what benefit is it going to be to the farming class in the long run?
For just as certain as you do that, just as certain will you see
going on here what we have seen going on in the United States, and by
the vicissitudes of life, by the changes of fortune, by the
differences among men -- some men selling and mortgaging, some men
acquiring wealth and others becoming poorer -- in a little while you
will have the reestablishment of the old system. But it is not just
in any consideration. What better right has an agricultural tenant to
receive any special advantage from the community than any other man?
If farms are to be bought for the agricultural tenant, why should not
boots for the artisans, shops for the clerks, boats for the fishermen
-- why should not the Government step in to furnish everyone with
capital? And consider this with regard to the buying out of the
landlords. Why, in Heaven's name, should they be bought out? Bought
out of what? Bought out of the privilege on imposing a tax upon their
fellow-citizens? Bought out of the privilege of appropriating what
belongs to all? That is not justice. If, when the people regain their
rights, compensation is due to anybody it is due to those who have
suffered injustice not to those who have caused it and profited by
it.&nbsp; <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html"><span

  <p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site Value Rating</a></p>
  <p>If site value rating is used only to finance local public services and to
    reward private activities that raise the rental value of land, the resulting
    reductions in other taxes on commerce and housing can be expected to raise
    the rental value of land by enough that land will retain most of its present
    sale value, and there will be no issue of compensating the existing owners
    of land. On the other hand, if the full rental value of land is collected
    through site value rating, then the sale value of unimproved land will fall
    to approximately zero. The sale value of houses will fall to the value of
    the houses themselves. Do the owners of land deserve compensation for these
  reductions in the market value of their wealth?</p>
  <p>First, it should be pointed out that the average taxpayer will pay the same
    tax as before, but in a different form. Site value rating will be substituted
    for some combination of income taxes, excise taxes, community charges, property
    value rates, and other taxes. A person should not complain about a change
    in the form of the taxes he pays if the total is the same. The above argument
    would be sufficient if every individual paid the same total tax after the
    change, but of course this will not occur. To some extent, increases in the
    sale value of capital will offset decreases in the sale value of land. This
    occurs because, by a removal of taxes from capital, site value rating will
    greatly increase the private returns to capital. This will generate a massive
    flow of capital toward any nation or region that reduces its taxes on capital.
    But such flows cannot occur instantaneously, and before they are completed
    the reductions in taxes on capital will raise the value of capital. In general,
    young persons will benefit more than older persons from a move to site value
    rating, because they tend to own less expensive plots of land if they own
    land at all, and they have many years ahead of them to benefit from reduction
    in other taxes. Those who are yet unborn will benefit most of all, because
    their birthrights to equal shares of the provenance of nature, as well as
    to the product of their labour, will be recognized. Net financial losses
    will tend to be greatest for older persons. Their houses will fall in sale
    value. They will be required to pay annually the rental value of the land
    on which their houses sit, without as much in reductions of their income
    taxes, and with fewer years ahead of them to reap tax savings. On the other
    hand, they will have less concern about providing for their children, because
    houses will be much easier for their children to acquire. Further offsetting
    any claim to compensation would be any past unearned profits that potential
    claimants had made on ownership of land.</p>
  <p>In some circumstances, a claim for compensation would have merit. If a person
    had purchased a title to land from the government just before the introduction
    of site value rating, that person could reasonably claim compensation from
    government action that eliminated the value of his purchase. Even if a substantial
    amount of time has passed, it can be argued that a government should not
    be permitted to eliminate by legislation the value of an asset that it has
    sold. On this basis, anyone who owned land that was at one time purchased
    from the government would have a reasonable claim on a return of the (inflation
    adjusted) price for which the land was purchased from the government. A claim
    for interest on the purchase price could not be sustained, however. The use
    of the land since the time of purchase offsets the interest that could otherwise
    be claimed. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></p>

        As shown by the equations earlier in this report, the land value tax
            is not even any burden on future owners of the land, since the tax
            on the land reduces its purchase price. What the owner pays in a tax
            on his geo-rent, he saves in not having to pay that amount as mortgage
            interest. There are two ways of addressing any net burden that might
            fall on current landowners during a shift to land value taxes.<br>
