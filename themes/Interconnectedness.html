Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a></small></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">John Muir is right. <i>"Tug on any one thing and find it connected
          to everything else in the universe." </i>Tug on the property tax and find
          it connected to urban slums, farmland loss, political favoritism, and unearned
          equity with disrupted neighborhood tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar
          reforms have failed to address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think
          that the root could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base
          -- from buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith.
          Yet the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a powerful,
          if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring efficient use of
          land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the site's full annual
          value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land is a lower or zero
          tax rate upon improvements.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Economic Problems to Solve<br>
    </b></font><b><font size="2">
    </font></b><font size="3">Taxing built-value penalizes construction and maintenance
    of buildings. This deadweight loss on the local economy constrains housing supply
    and raises land values, driving speculation. Fewer people can then own parcels
    for homes and businesses, and debt
    levels increase.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Environmental Problems to Solve<br>
    </b></font><b><font size="2">
    </font></b><i><font size="3">Rus </font></i><font size="3">(rural regions) provide
    resources as <i>urbs </i>(cities) provide services. Yet neither does so efficiently
    now. Allowed by a present property tax that takes aim at buildings while treading
    lightly on sites, owners of sites and resources both overextract and withhold
    appropriate land from use, speculating on a higher future return. Vacant and
    underused sites waste on the average about 22 percent of city surface. Using
    land less than optimally means more land must be
    used.<b> </b>Clark County, Washington, combines the empty storefronts, vacant
    lots, run-down buildings in Vancouver, the county seat, with one of the fastest
    growth rates in the nation. The inflated prices are hardly affordable by governments
    intending to purchase open space;
    hence parks are smaller and fewer.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Political Problems to Solve<br>
    </b></font><b><font size="2">
    </font></b><font size="3">To manage growth, counties adopt boundaries and other
    restraints -- which are neither effective nor politically
    stable. The once "green" Oregon legislature, for instance, in '95 and '97 (controlled
    by Republicans) passed over ten bills to drastically weaken long-established
    land use laws.<b> </b>Also under siege is the property tax, formerly the largest
    source of public revenue in the US (back when the federal and state governments
    were much smaller). Voters in many states have passed caps and rate reductions,
    spurring a search
    for alternative revenue sources.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Equity Problems to Solve    </b></font><b><font size="2"><br>
    </font></b><font size="3">America is rapidly turning back the clock; we are on
    the path to becoming a two-class society struggling on a ravaged planet. For
    the first time since European settlers carved out their own country, tenants
    outnumber owners. Farm workers outnumber farm owners. Growers under dictatorial
    contracts to food processors outnumber farmers still calling their own shots.
    Tenants, as in Portland, Oregon, outnumber homeowners. That gulf widens dramatically
    when defining owners as those not under a mortgage. In communities of rapid turnover,
    crime invades along with government corruption.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Previous Reform Attempts that Failed    </b></font><b><font size="2"><br>
    </font></b><font size="3">To bolster their local economies and fatten their tax
    base, local governments compete to attract large new employers. Hoping to recoup
    down the road when businesses pay full property taxes, elected officials offer
    such inducements as five-year abatements and low system development charges.
    Yet each locality must outdo others' incentives. Enterprise zones and tax privileges
    amount to
    major subsidies that would otherwise generate substantial tax revenues.<br>
    <br>
    Already, Washington, Oregon, and other states employ a nonregulatory means to
    reward preservation of unbuilt-upon land. They assess farm and resource lands
    at current use rather than at market value to avoid pressuring owners to develop.
    However, as long as demand for land persists, and the more central locations
    are not offered in the market, then the temptation before farmers to sell out
    to developers also
    persists.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Our Different Idea    </b></font><b><font size="2"><br>
    </font></b><font size="3">To send a clear message to new businesses that their
    growth will not be unnecessarily impeded, government can permanently shift taxes
    off sales, income, and buildings and onto land. Since taxing land lowers its
    cost, business could pay this greater land tax from what otherwise would be spent
    on purchasing land. This higher land levy would remain affordable as long as
    owners use their land
    efficiently.<br>
    <br>
    Developers argue that abundant land lowers its price and thus the property tax
    burden. While true, newly-available land need not be current open space. Without
    baring the countryside to new development, both land price and the property tax
    can be lowered. The price of land drops when the tax rate on land is raised.
    And yet this higher rate, if coupled with a lower or absent rate on buildings,
    does not swell the
    property tax burden of most residents. Indeed, this <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">property tax shift
    (PTS)</span> is progressive, providing relief for most residents. And by taxing
    land, society impels owners who had been speculatively withholding or underutilizing
    theirs to develop or offer their parcels for development. Hence the newly-available
    land comes from recycled
    sites, not from open space.<br>
    <br>
    The PTS not only lowers the price of land, it also lowers the cost of buildings.
    Untaxing structures, besides reducing their cost, also augments their supply.
    More buildings means lower prices and rents. As the prices of both buildings
    and land drop, more people are able to
    purchase a home, apartment, or condominium.<br>
    <br>
    Ethically, the PTS simplifies the revenue system, leaving fewer decisions to
    be made by politicians in favor of their backers. All the essential facts are
    open to public scrutiny: the land's owner, value, use, and levy. And since mere
    speculation would no longer be profitable, owners would have less monetary motive
    to try to unduly
    influence the political process. ... <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">read the whole article</a></font></p>
