as
distinct from capital:
"land, labor and capital" were the three basic "factors

"limitational," meaning at least some of each was needed for
all economic activity (v.&nbsp; A9, below)<small><span

Corruption of Economics</a>, </i>a companion volume in this

  <li><small>Many treat the matter by seizing on

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How the Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The classical tradition of economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: <a href="About_HG.html">Henry
George</a>. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
travelled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and travelled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small> ...</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being returned
to society in rent.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The failure of society to
recapture the appropriate level of land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <a

  Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">Who Says Cities are Poor? They Just
  Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The premises of discourse</strong></p>
  <p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary economics
      starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production in the
      creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive and,
      taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value. The
      first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called land.
      Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied; it meant
      not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth. Today sunlight,
      radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added. The second factor
      of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort applied by people's
      minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product of past application
      of land and labor to current production: capital. Each factor in classical
      economics has its price, the product of which is the creation of wealth as
      we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages; the price of capital
      is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as understood in economics,
      is not payment for the use of property owned by others; it has, rather, a more
      technical meaning, one which will require greater explication below.</p>
  <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
    and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of
    taxation
      with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
      building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor
    continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course
    of a shift
      from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had
    earlier encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212; the
      product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land
    by itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
      altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
      formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
  <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and rent
        as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the surplus
        produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
        to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form
      of taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by shifting
        taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance of markets
        would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless to taxpayers.
        This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now possible to demonstrate
        with the advent of computer power and available data. It amplifies and validates
        what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical claim. We can now
        show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the services demanded
        of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that exceeds all others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And
        unlike other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive. Economic
        rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates through the
        markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
        result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price. Economic
        rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason, and comes
        about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by the consequence
        rather of society's collective effort. British political economist David
        Ricardo first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to agricultural
        production
        in the early 1800s, but its applicability today is understood far more easily
        with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas ground rent to Ricardo
        reflected the differential gifts of nature inherent in various land sites,
        it is today
        better understood as reflective of locational differentials in the capacities
        of communities. ...</p>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
    leaders have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e., on
    land value)
      or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their homes
      and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
    and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
      their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any
    threat to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling
      their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
      that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
    facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a
    reverse mortgage.
      But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
    benefit of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
      not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
      from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs.
      In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits
      constitutes
      a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is
      both unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater
      good.... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Kris Feder: <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html">Progress and Poverty Today</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As this book was written, the Industrial
    Revolution was transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just
    a century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort had
    become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals, railroads, steamships
    and the telegraph were linking regional economies into a national and global
    network of exchange. The United States had stretched from coast to coast;
    the western frontier was evaporating.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor Henry George
    marveled at the stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous
    trends. Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished
    want and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working classes
    from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the division of labor,
    the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization had increased the dependence
    of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces beyond their control. The working
    poor were always, of course, the most vulnerable in depressions, and last
    to recover from them. Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America,
    and indeed, were more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring
    West. It was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath society,
    but through society. Those who are above the point of separation are elevated,
    but those who are below are crushed down." This, the "great enigma of our
    times," was the problem George set out to solve in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
    and Poverty</span>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists will recognize his analysis
    as a precursor to the modern marginal productivity theory of functional distribution.
    His story is framed in the language of what is today called classical political
    economy, though George was careful to avoid inconsistencies of definition
    and reasoning which, he showed, had led other economists astray.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>A central feature of the British
      classical school was the classification of productive resources into three "factors
    of production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
    conceived of these in terms of <em>three great social classes</em> (the workers, the
    landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the other hand, identified
    them as <em>functional</em> categories, distinguished by the conditions under which
    the factors are made available for production.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the earnings of
    the factors of production measure their separate contributions to the value
    of the product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments
    for land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
    terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a persistently
    low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of increase in productive
    power, do wages tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living?"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds systematically. First,
    George explores the prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which
    relied principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in combination
    with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy. Together these
    theories implied that the aggregate income of labor depends upon the amount
    of capital devoted to the payment of wages. An increase in wages required
    an increase in the amount of capital per worker. However, any rise in living
    standards above mere subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear
    more children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and, therefore,
    wages - to recede again.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Moreover, population growth diminished agricultural
    productivity by forcing recourse to inferior soils. Technological advance
    and capital accumulation might afford a period of relative prosperity - but
    ultimately, increasing applications of labor to a fixed amount of land could
    raise output only at a diminishing rate. In short, immutable laws of nature
    - the population principle and the law of diminishing returns to land - were
    widely believed to explain the persistence of poverty. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To George, the Malthusian analysis was abhorrent:
    It asserted that no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern
    of income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only compounded
    the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth rates.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his own analysis, George takes meticulous
    care to avoid inconsistencies of definition and reasoning. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public debate about economic policy revolves
    today, as it always has, around a tension between two fundamental social
    goals. Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
    efficiency and equity."<strong>&nbsp; ... </strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Most economists deem it their business to evaluate the efficiency of
  policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they leave it
  to philosophers and the political process to evaluate questions of justice.
  Can it be true that society's arrangements to provide for common needs must
  always confront a divisive choice between equity and efficiency - between what
  is fair and what is feasible?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it; he asserted
    the reverse: <b>Full recognition of economic rights and responsibilities
    would reveal the goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing.
    Neither social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long
    be enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are harmonious," George
    proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root cause of widening inequality
    lies not in the laws of nature, but in social maladjustments which ignore
    them. Moreover, the breach of justice which underlies the problem of poverty
    is not merely incidental to economic development; it impedes development,
    leading to wider and wider inequality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal distribution
    is itself wasteful of wealth. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment of labor
    mean that energy and intelligence go untapped. ... </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of privileges
    and entitlements tends to cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic
    instability and stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that
    ultimately may threaten whole civilizations. <b>George's central contribution
    was to show that the distinction between individual property and common property
    forms a rational basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from
    that of the private.</b>&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>George's insights have wide application to modern problems.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Modern fiscal and monetary policies have not resolved the problem of
  macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet a <b>half century before Keynes, George outlined
  a theory of boom and bust which explained the underlying instability of the
  market economy under present fiscal institutions. ...</b></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Many American cities are plagued by the twin problems of urban decay
  and suburban sprawl.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Thus, George's synthesis informs a research program of remarkable breadth.
  Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct paradigm of political
  economy, one which reconciles the contradictions between the two competing
  paradigms dominant in the world today - the mainstream neoclassical school,
  which tends to focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets,
  and Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can and
  should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical economics. What
  is certain is that geoclassical thought bears crucially on some of the foremost
  controversies in America and the world today.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

      a particular tax imposed upon them. Ground-rents seem, in this respect, a more
      proper subject of particular taxation than even the ordinary rent of land.&#8221;14 ... </p>
  <p>... There will always be critics who concoct a huge cost in getting assessments
      correct down to the last penny, or claim, without any evidence, that real estate
      is a trivial portion of the economy. Such critics date back to the days of
      Henry George, when the landed interests felt threatened by his ideas. Those
      opponents have been thoroughly rebutted in the book, <em>Critics of Henry George</em> (the
      latest edition edited in 2004 by Robert Andelson). The reasons for such
      attempts to falsify and trivialize rent-based public finance, and even
      to eliminate
      the land factor from economics, are chronicled and analyzed in The Corruption
      of Economics, especially in the chapter by Mason Gaffney, &#8220;<a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Neo-classical
      Economics as a Stratagem against Henry George</a>.&#8221; This negative
      viewpoint is perpetuated by academics who learn of land value taxation
      from misleading
      secondary sources, not bothering to dig any further. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read
