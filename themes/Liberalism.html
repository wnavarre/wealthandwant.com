Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice and
Economic Reform </a><br>
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>No man is an Island
entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the utilitarian proposal
that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Consider first the <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>claim
that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian
</span>formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
However, this does not make Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Rawls has proposed that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
</span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes. .
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Suppose that a bone-marrow transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me, then
what about a kidney? <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one available
heart after I have had my share of years.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Just as I own my kidneys, so do I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.<strong>&nbsp; ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism.</strong> In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Locke qualified his statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;
<strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
There are two fundamental problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Justice -- the balancing of the scales -- is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position, "I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform -- the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rawls sets his proposals in the framework of a fourth possible principle of
    public action, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian </span>suggestion
    that it is just to coerce people to abide by the rules that they would have
    agreed to if they had had a chance, before they knew their individual circumstances.
    One difficulty with this rule is that it is so hard to know what it is that
    people would have agreed to in these circumstances. Rawls is convinced that
    people would have agreed to a lexical ordering of maximum individual liberty
    and the maximin principle. John Harsanyi offers a strong argument for the proposition
    that they would have agreed to the rules that would maximize total (or, equivalently,
    average) utility. This has some strange implications. For example, if it is
    possible to separate individuals into ascetics and sybarites, then the maximization
    of total utility requires that the ascetics be forced to work very hard, with
    the resulting output used for the benefit of the sybarites. And if one of your
    kidneys (or your eyes) would provide me with more utility than it provides
    you, then the state is justified in extracting it from you and giving it to
    me. Utilitarianism does not accommodate
  individual rights.</p>
  <p>The disagreements among contractarians about what contractarianism implies
    provide a hint of a difficulty that Bruce Ackerman elaborates in <b><i>Social
    Justice in the Liberal State</i></b>: Contractarianism offers so little defense
    against people with power who delude themselves about the undeniability of
    their beliefs about what people would agree to before they knew their personal
    circumstances. The person who feels oppressed says "I never would have agreed
    to these rules before I knew my personal circumstances." Those with power reply, "It's
    obvious to us that you would have. Stop your griping." The scope for further
    dialogue is small, and the potential for abuse is great.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another possible framework for the justification
      of government action is that those with power are simply elitists: They may
      believe that their exercise of power is justified by their superior understanding
      of the nature of the good. </span>While it is not unreasonable to suggest
      that there are some persons who do have superior understanding of the nature
      of the good, it is extremely dangerous for people to justify the exercise
      of political power by self identification as members of the elite who have
      superior understanding of the nature of the good. It was thinking of that
      sort that gave the world Stalinism. The general thrust of Western political
      thinking has been that elitism is simply unacceptable as a justification
      for the exercise of political power.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the basis of the arguments given, I
      reject conservatism, majoritarianism, egalitarianism, contractarianism,
      and elitism
      as justifications for coercive taxing and spending.</span> A framework
      for just social arrangements that does make sense to me is classical liberalism,
      which asserts that it is just to coerce people to accord others the maximum
      individual liberty that all can have. This means that people have rights
      to their bodies, their talents, the products of their labor, and the returns
      to their savings. Anything produced by human effort belong to the producer,
      or to the producer's successor in title through gift and exchange. ...</p>
  <p>In a world that adhered to a classical liberal understanding of justice,
    there would be three sources of funding for people with
special needs:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1) insurance that those with special needs had
    bought for themselves prior to the onset of their special needs,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2) donations from family, friends and other compassionate
    persons, and</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">3) local public expenditures that would be non-coercively
    financed, because anyone who objected to the financing could leave the locality.</p>
  <p>In a just would, people would ensure, prior to conceiving children, that
    any expensive special needs that their children might have would be paid
    for, either by insurance that the parents would buy, or by voluntary conventions
    in their communities that the community would pay the costs of such needs.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you object that some people would not be able to afford such insurance
    for all their children. If this is true, it implies one of two things.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Either the parents of such children are behaving unjustly by conceiving
      those children, who will either lack what they ought to have or will be
      able to receive it only by the imposition of unjust taxes. </li>
    <li>Or else the parents have been treated unjustly by having started life
      without enough resources to provide for the children that they ought to
      have had the chance to bring into the world. I would guess that sometimes
      the first is true, sometimes the second, and sometimes both.</li>
  </ul>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The possibility that prospective parents might
  be unable to afford to provide for the children that they ought to have the
  chance to bring into the world highlights the possible need for a one-time
  redistribution that would give everyone a fair starting point. </span>This
  does not mean equality for ever. It does not necessarily even mean equality
  at the starting time. What it means is allocating initial rights in such a
  way that we do not mind requiring people to pay the costs of their choices,
  including the choice of conceiving children (unless they belong to communities
  that agree to pay the costs of
some of their choices).
<p>Whenever a one-time redistribution is proposed, a reaction of many economists
  is, "Yeah, right. Why would anyone one believe that it would be only one time?" What
  would make it reasonable to believe that such a redistribution would be a one-time
  event is its rationale: The recognition that some persons have had unfairly
  inadequate starting positions in life, and the determination to end that. If
  the purpose is achieved, there is no rationale for further redistribution,
  unless, at some future time, our society attains a new moral insight that implies
  that further redistribution is required. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read
