<blockquote>
  <p>Think how different our economy would be were we to be collecting from
  the owners of radio and television spectrum the annual rental value of
  the bits of spectrum they occupy.&nbsp; Remember the saying that the
  airwaves belong to the American people?&nbsp; Here's how that would be
  implemented. <br>
  <br>
  Were we to collect rent on broadcast spectrum, every campaign ad would
  be a contribution to the commons, instead of lining the pockets of the
  individual and corporate owners of the spectrum.</p>
  <p>David Cay Johnston, in an interview with the Rochester City News a few months
    after the publication of his important book, <em>Perfectly Legal: The Covert
    Campaign To Rig Our Tax System To Benefit the Super Rich &#8212; And Cheat
    Everybody Else</em> which, among other
    things,
    speaks
    to the extent to which our elected representatives are focused on those who
    supply
    the funds they will need for their next election campaign, was discussing
    the estate tax when he said, </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>After finishing the book, I got off a plane and shared a taxi with
        a former state senator who is personally very comfortable. He told me
        that I was
      being overly kind to politicians in my analysis. He said, &quot;Every year
      that I was in office I knew who my 10 biggest donors were. I knew that
      I had to
        show
        them that I was working for what they wanted or they would just take
      their money and go to the other guy. And, you know, I don't think I ever
      once looked
      in the mirror and said, 'What am I doing for the average person in my district?'&quot;</em></p>
    <p><em> My best example of the political donor class is: Two days after 9/11 Congress
        came back into session. The Republican leadership had 10 bills they introduced
        to deal with the attack on 9/11. One of them was a tax bill. So what did
        it do for the firefighters, the police officers, the volunteers, the secretaries,
        the military officers sitting at their desks at the Pentagon and the flight
        attendants [who were killed]? It gave them estate tax relief. Not income
        tax
        relief, not a guaranteed college education for their kids --- estate tax
        relief. That's what Congress thought they needed. It was like a Rorschach
        test, and
        what did we find out? Congress was thinking about the super rich. Classic
        economic theory says that's what Congress should do under our campaign system,
        because
        those are their real patrons.</em> <font size="-1">[&quot;Tax watchdog: David Cay Johnston

    of land it created? How different would America look if, instead of the corporations
    who own our broadcast media being enriched by our political campaigns, the
    public till was the beneficiary? How different might journalism be?</p>

  on the NTIA's Comprehensive Policy Review of Use and Management of the
Radio Frequency Spectrum</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both on grounds of justice and
on grounds of efficiency, a market-based
system of allocating rights to use the radio frequency spectrum, with
public collection of the value of rights granted, is best. The right to
use the frequency spectrum is a scarce resource, whose value is derived
primarily from the mere existence of the spectrum and not from the
efforts of those who might be granted use. Thus the whole population
has equal respectable claims to use. But efficient use of the resource
requires exclusive assignment of frequencies within particular
geographical areas. Therefore justice is served by requiring those who
receive the privilege of use to compensate the rest of the population
for that privilege. <a

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>...</strong><a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_PTS.html"><big><big><small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></big></big></a><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>And by
taxing land, society impels owners who had been speculatively
withholding or underutilizing theirs to develop or offer their parcels
for development. Hence the newly-available land comes from recycled
sites, not from open space.</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>The PTS not only lowers the price of land, it
also lowers the cost of
buildings. Untaxing structures, besides reducing their cost, also
augments their supply. More buildings means lower prices and rents. As
the prices of both buildings and land drop, more people are able to
purchase a home, apartment, or condominium.</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ethically, the
PTS simplifies the revenue system, leaving fewer
decisions to be made by politicians in favor of their backers. All the
essential facts are open to public scrutiny: the land's owner, value,
use, and levy. And since mere speculation would no longer be
profitable, owners would have less monetary motive to try to unduly
influence the political process.</span></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font></small><big><small><small><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a dividend replaces
expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree</span> on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
much
and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Politicians
define legally &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts of polluted air and water for GM and
Monsanto, keeping safe the wealth of those responsible. </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Not to be outdone by any legislature,
the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values
skyrocket near a new light rail stop. Molly Ivins wrote, </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"Henry George must be in his
grave
spinning' like a cyclotron. We, the people at large, make the land more
desirable; and then the landowners want us to pay them because we won't
allow them to poison the air or to pollute the rivers." (1995 March)<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That&#8217;s how great fortunes are
made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). Land titles, corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;
means &#8220;private law&#8221;) funnel multi-trillions of dollars each year from
the many to the few.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Trillions are enough money that the present beneficiaries spend
fortunes on <span style="font-weight: bold;">electing their water boys</span>
to Congress and state legislatures. Why do public servants agree to let
public assets go for peanuts? Partly out of habit, partly because the
recipients contribute mightily to their political campaigns, but
also.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from
less.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Given the collateral damage by most taxes, the Left must make
clear
that the extra income is to come not from taxes upon people&#8217;s
legitimate earnings but from rent, making it a social salary from
society&#8217;s surplus.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>While
opponents
will cry &#8220;redistribution&#8221;, the Left can point out that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">sharing the
commonwealth is actually &#8220;predistribution.&#8221; Acting like a REIT (Real
Estate Investment Trust) for the public, government would merely
recover and disburse rents before the elite or their friendly
politicians have a chance to misspend society&#8217;s surplus.</span><span

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Numbers can be put on this sort of thing, and Kevin Phillips, a former Republican
    strategist, has done so. &#8220;The timber industry spent $8 million in campaign
    contributions to preserve a logging road subsidy worth $458 million &#8212; the
    return on their investment was 5,725 percent. Glaxo Wellcome invested $1.2
    million in campaign contributions to get a 19-month patent extension on Zantac
    worth $1 billion &#8212; their net return: 83,333 percent. The tobacco industry
    spent $30 million for a tax break worth $50 billion &#8212; the return on
    their investment: 167,000 percent. For a paltry $5 million in campaign contributions,
    the broadcasting industry was able to secure free digital TV licenses, a
    giveaway of public property worth $70 billion &#8212; that&#8217;s an incredible
    1,400,000 percent return on their investment.&#8221; <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Three points are worth making here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> First, ownership isn&#8217;t the same thing as trusteeship. Owners
            of property &#8212; even government owners &#8212; have wide latitude
            to do whatever they want with it; a trustee does not. Trustees are bound
            by the terms of their trust and by centuries-old principles of trusteeship,
            foremost among which is &#8220;undivided loyalty&#8221; to beneficiaries.</li>
    <li> Second, in a capitalist democracy, the state is a dispenser of many
            valuable prizes. Whoever amasses the most political power wins the
      most valuable prizes. The rewards include property rights, friendly regulators,
            subsidies, tax breaks, and free or cheap use of the commons. The
      notion
            that the state promotes &#8220;the common good&#8221; is sadly naive.</li>
    <li> <strong>Third, while free marketers are fond of saying that capitalism is
            a precondition for democracy, what they neglect to add is that capitalism
            also distorts democracy. Like gravity, its tug is constant. The bigger
            the concentrations of capital, the stronger the tug.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We face a disheartening quandary here. <strong>Profit-maximizing corporations
        dominate our economy. Their programming makes them enclose and diminish
        common wealth. </strong>The only obvious counterweight is government, yet government
        is dominated by these same corporations.</p>
  <p>One possible way out of this dilemma is to reprogram corporations &#8212; that
        is, to make them driven by something other than profit. This, however,
        is like asking elephants to dance &#8212; they&#8217;re just not built
        to do it. Corporations are built to make money, and the truth is, as a
        society we want them to make money. We&#8217;ll look at this further
        in the next chapter.</p>
  <p>Another possible way out is to liberate government from corporations,
        not just momentarily, but long-lastingly. This is easier said than done.
        Corporations have decimated their old adversary, organized labor, and
    turned the media into their mouthpiece. Occasionally a breakthrough is made
    in
        campaign financing &#8212; for example, corporations are now barred from
        giving so-called soft money to political parties &#8212; but corporate
        money soon finds other channels to flow through. The return on such investments
        is simply too high to stop them.</p>
  <p>Does this mean there&#8217;s no hope? I don&#8217;t think so. The window
        of opportunity is small, but not nonexistent. Throughout American history,
        anticorporate forces have come to power once or twice per century. In the
        nineteenth century, we had the eras of Jackson and Lincoln; in the twentieth
        century, those of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty-first century
        equivalents will, I&#8217;m sure, arise. It may take a calamity of some
        sort &#8212; another war, a depression, or an ecological disaster &#8212; to
        trigger the next anticorporate ascendancy, but sooner or later it will
        come. Our job is to be ready when it comes. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>A spectrum or airwaves trust would have a distinct mission: to reduce the
    influence of corporations on our democracy. Its economic and ecological impacts
    could be significant (reducing corporate political influence will improve
    many policies), but they&#8217;re secondary to the political objective.</p>
  <p>According to a study by the New America Foundation, the market value of
    the airwave licenses we&#8217;ve given free to corporate broadcasters is
    roughly $500 billion. It&#8217;s possible this value will decline as unlicensed
    wi-fi spreads, but meanwhile broadcasters sell our airwaves to advertisers
    and reap billions that belong, at least in part, to all of us.</p>
  <p>Part of that money comes from political candidates who must purchase TV
    and radio ads to get elected. The problem isn&#8217;t so much the unearned
    windfall broadcasters collect; rather, it&#8217;s the fact that candidates
    are compelled to pay it to them. That makes politicians kowtow to corporate
    donors in order to pay broadcasters. Other democracies give free airtime
    to political candidates, but we protect the broadcasters&#8217; lock on our
    airwaves. By privatizing our airwaves, in other words, we&#8217;ve effectively
    privatized our democracy. The job of a spectrum trust would be to take back
    our democracy by taking back our airwaves.</p>
  <p>This could be done in a couple of ways. One wouldn&#8217;t require an actual
    trust: Congress could simply say that, in exchange for free spectrum licenses,
    broadcasters must give a certain amount of free airtime to political candidates.
    Alternatively, broadcasters could pay for their licenses, with revenue going
    to a nonpartisan trust. That trust would allocate funds to candidates for
    the purchase of TV and radio ads; the allocation formula would take account
    of cost differences between media markets and other relevant variables. Neither
    of these approaches would prevent corporations from lobbying or contributing
    to candidates&#8217; other expenses, but they would level the political playing
    field by greatly reducing the sums candidates have to raise to get elected.
