Monopoly Capitalism</span>  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Capitalism is a very fine system, and the
      U.S. really ought to try it sometime! That is one of the themes of this
      website.</div>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>What we have now is <strong>Capitalism on a Tilted Playing
              Field</strong>. No
            wonder so many of us are struggling to earn enough to support our selves
            and our families.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>It isn't that capitalism isn't the best system
        (I'm persuaded that it is), but rather that we <em>aren't</em> yet operating
        under a truly capitalist system. &quot;Land monopoly capitalism&quot; seems
        to me to be the best shorthand description
            of what we have now &#8212; and it isn't producing widely shared
            prosperity or genuine equality of opportunity, both of which are
            key criteria
            on which a system should be judged. Ours is lacking, and I believe
            that Henry George
            points to the remedy which will correct the tilt.</p>
      <p>As long as we permit individuals, families, trusts and corporations
        to privatize economic value that rightly belongs to all of us, and then
        to fund government
        spending via taxes on wages and products, we are permitting a system
        designed to concentrate income and wealth in a small segment of our population.
        This is theft of the worst sort &#8212; legalized theft. A fresh robbery
        every day. </p>

          spirit. Material progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land;
          it can but
              add to the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when
          land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity without increasing
          wages or
              improving the condition of those who have but their labor. It can
          but add to the value of land and the power which its possession gives.
          Everywhere,
              in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is the
          base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of

                the public revenues are now raised, a single tax levied upon the

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift
            the whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. The
            needle of the seamstress
                  and the great manufactory; the cart horse and the locomotive;
            the fishing boat and the steamship; the farmer's plow and the merchant's
                  stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be free to make or
            to save,
                  to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed by the taxgatherer.
                  Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The more
                  you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the
                  state would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as
                  thrifty, as enterprising as you choose, you shall have your
                  full reward! You
                  shall not be fined for making two blades of grass grow where
                  one grew before; you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate
                  wealth.&quot;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose
                that lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox
                that treadeth out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift,
                and skill, their natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is
                to the community also a natural reward. The law of society is, each
                for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep to himself the
                good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
                enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields
                collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his
                gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in
                addition to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others
                than the owner are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the
                birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which it helps
                to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
                rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so
                with everything else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship,
                or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that
                prompts him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full
                reward of his labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital.
                For the more that labor and capital produce, the greater grows the
                common wealth in which all may share. And in the value or rent of
                land is this general gain expressed in a definite and concrete form.
                Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to labor and
                capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
                this would commensurately increase.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange
                to the value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus
                to the production of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities.
                For under this system no one would care to hold land unless to use
                it, and land now withheld from use would everywhere be thrown open
                to improvement. ...</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
                land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use,
                just as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could
                afford to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts
                to demand more for it than the use to which it could at the time
                be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had attained a value,
                taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
                would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or
                sowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter
                how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so
              much land idle.</p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference
                of all public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully
                appreciated until we consider the effect upon the distribution of
              wealth. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which
                appears in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater
                and greater inequality as material progress goes on, we have found
                it in the fact that, as civilization advances, the ownership of land,
                now in private hands, gives a greater and greater power of appropriating
                the wealth produced by labor and capital.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and
                indirect, and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as
                it went, to counteract this tendency to inequality, and, if it went
                so far as to take in taxation the whole of rent, the cause of inequality
                would be totally destroyed. Rent, instead of causing inequality,
                as now, would then promote equality. Labor and capital would then
                receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the state
                in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
                would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be
                divided into two portions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <div style="text-align: left;">
              <p> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between
                      individual producers, according to the part each had taken in the
                      work of production;</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <div style="text-align: left;">
              <p> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
                      in public benefits to all its members.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong,
                young children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the
                blind, as well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while
                one part represents the result of individual effort in production,
                the
                other represents the increased power with which the community
                as a whole aids the individual.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken
                by the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends
                to produce inequality as material progress goes on would then tend
                to produce greater and greater equality.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity
                of labor may not be raised by social adjustments which will give
                to the producers of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages
                and enjoyments! With present processes the gain would be simply incalculable,
                but just as wages are high, so do the invention and utilization of
                improved processes and machinery go on with greater rapidity and
                ease.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish
            to lose sight of the fact, that while thus preventing waste and thus
            adding to the efficiency
                    of labor, the equalization in the distribution of wealth
            that would result from the simple plan of taxation that I propose,
            must
            lessen
                    the intensity with which wealth is pursued. It seems to me
            that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
            no one
                    would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would
                    take the trouble to strive and to strain for it as men do
                    now. For,
                    certainly,
                    the spectacle of men who have only a few years to live, slaving
                    away their time for the sake of dying rich, is in itself
                    so unnatural
                    and absurd, that in a state of society where the abolition
                    of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration
                    with which the
                    masses of men now regard the possession of great riches,
                    whoever would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would
                    be looked
                    upon as we would now look on a man who would thatch his head
                    with half
                    a dozen hats.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not
                spare it? Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of
                development, it is not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization
                do not come from the weakness of the springs of production. What
                it suffers from, and what, if a remedy be not applied, it must die
                from, is unequal distribution!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the
                standpoint of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate
                of production is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are
                pursued, is one of the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While,
                were this insane desire to get rich at any cost lessened, mental
                activities now devoted to scraping together riches would be translated
                into far higher spheres of usefulness. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole

          <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of
                our inquiry is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations
                and the growth and decay of civilizations, and it accords with those
                deep-seated recognitions of relation and sequence that we denominate
                moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions the greatest
              certitude and highest sanction.</p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the
                evils arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth,
                which are becoming more and more apparent as modern civilization
                goes on, are not incidents of progress, but tendencies which must
                bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure themselves, but,
                on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow greater
                and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road
                every previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these
                evils are not imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from
                social maladjustments which ignore natural laws, and that in removing
                their cause we shall be giving an enormous impetus to progress.</p>

          <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance
            pinches and embrutes men, and all the manifold evils which flow from
            it, spring from a
                  denial of justice. In permitting the monopolization of the
            opportunities which nature freely offers to all, we have ignored
            the fundamental
                  law of justice &#8212; for, so far as we can see, when we view
                  things upon a large scale, justice seems to be the supreme
                  law of the universe.
                  But by sweeping away this injustice and asserting the rights
                  of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves

                we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material
                progress goes on. This is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do
                not realize is extracting from the masses in every civilized country
                the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and
                more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed;
                that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and
              must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>

          <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a

                squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads

            <small>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world
                        swimming
                        in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
                        the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
                        while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
          primitive, this will work well enough.</small></div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turn away the eyes of the mind for
                        a moment, let time pass, and
                        look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
                        multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
                        even supposing there have been no important inventions or
                        improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
                        causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
                        During this time some of these people will have been careless,
                        generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
                        of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
                        they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
                        inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
                        their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
                        pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
                        trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
                        fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
                        things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
                        happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
                        again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
                        possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
                        treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
                        equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
                        than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
                        many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
                        our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
                        no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
                        taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
                        imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
                        utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
          produced poverty and virtual slavery.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For the people we have supposed
                        are human beings &#8211; that is to
                        say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
                        live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
                        make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
                        to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
                        have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
                        land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
                        rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
                        absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
                        only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
                        land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
                        his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
          everything as he wills.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, however, the concentration of
                        landownership has not gone so
                        far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
                        land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
                        competition between them as well as between those who have only their
                        labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
                        will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
                        Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
                        produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
                        factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
                        factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
                        as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
                        these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
                        very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
                        his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
                        labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
                        it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
                        laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
                        making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
                        over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
                        pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
                        urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
                        the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
                        are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
                        larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
                        produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
                        steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
                        of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
                        effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
                        constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
                        give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
                        same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
                        work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
                        little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
                        of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
                        the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
          would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But let us introduce another
                        element into the supposition. Let us
                        suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
                        steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
                        reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
          are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Manifestly, the effect of all such
                        discoveries and inventions is
                        to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
                        same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
                        amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
                        the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
                        something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
                        to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
                        invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
                        this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
                        being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
                        proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
                        the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
                        inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
          dependent.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, since we are imagining
                        conditions, imagine laborsaving
                        inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
                        perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
                        away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
                        to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
                        else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
                        continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
          the landowners!&nbsp; </small><small>... <span

                        besides pecuniary benefit. I have lost
                        the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
                        character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
                        benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
                        country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
                        say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
                        capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
                        far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
                        for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
                        them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
                        country, and his own fortune together."<br>
          </small></div>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whereas it is not my capital
                        that does any of these things. It is
                        not my capital but the labourer&#8217;s toil that builds up my fortune
                        and the wealth of the country. It is not my employment that keeps him
                        from pauperism, but my monopoly of the land forcing him into my
                        employment that keeps him on the brink of it. It is not want of
                        capital that keeps the labourer from using the land, but my refusing
                        him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. All
                        the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
                        week&#8217;s earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during
                        the first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or
                        for others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
                        every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
                        with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself
                        by taking a trip into the country, where he will find well-to-do
                        farmers who began with nothing but a spade and an axe (so to speak)
                        and worked their way up in the manner described.&nbsp;

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But now another thought strikes
                        me. Instead of paying an overseer
                        to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
                        doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8211; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
                        called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
                        for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
                        yearly pay. He, not I, shall find all the capital, take all the risk,
                        and engage and supervise the men, paying me a lump sum, called rent,
                        out of the proceeds of their toil, and make what he can for himself
                        out of the surplus. The competition is as keen in its way for the
                        land, among people of his class, as it is among the labourers for
                        employment, only that as they are all possessed of some little means
                        (else they could not compete) they are in no danger of immediate
                        want, and can stand out for rather better terms than the labourers,
                        who are forced by necessity to take what terms they can get. The
                        minimum in each case amounts practically to a "mere living", but the
                        mere living they insist on is one of a rather higher standard than
                        the labourers&#8217;; it means a rather more abundant supply and
                        better quality of those little comforts which are next door to
                        necessaries. It means, in short, a living of a kind to which people
          of that class are accustomed.</small></p>

                        profits, then &#8211; a reduction
                        equal to the tenant&#8217;s narrow margin of profit &#8211; I have all
                        the toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk
                        too, for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be
                        forthcoming, and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the
                        full amount, no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence
                        of all other debts. All my capital is set free for investment
                        elsewhere, and I am freed from the odium of a slave owner,
                        notwithstanding that the men still toil for my enrichment as when
                        they were slaves, and that I get more out of them than ever. If I wax
                        rich while they toil from hand to mouth, and in depressed seasons
                        find it hard to get work at all; it is not, to all appearances, my
                        doing, but merely the force of circumstances, the law of nature, the
                        state of the labour market &#8211; fine sounding names that hide the
          ugly reality.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
                        I that do it; it is that greedy
                        and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
                        and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
                        considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
                        not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent --
                        and
                        get it. Like the lilies of the field, I toil not, neither do I spin,
                        and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered) comes
                        to me of itself. Nay, people bid against each other for the privilege
                        of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
                        comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
                        indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers&#8217;
            toil. It is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which
          they would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
                        that chattel slavery is not the
                        only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8211; the sole source of our daily bread &#8211; is denied unless one
                        pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
                        economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
          the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.</small></p>

                        filled with people who fought for the principles of &#8216;the single
                        tax&#8217; on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since
                        then and they have gradually yielded to the forces of privilege and
                        power daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental
                        question, lest they, too, become ridiculed. And so the world
                        continues to wallow in this particular ignorance &#8211; and in its

          <blockquote>
            <p>Note 57: While in the Pennsylvania coal regions a few years ago
              I was told of an incident that illustrates the power of perpetuating
            poverty which resides in the absolute ownership of land.</p>
            <p>The miners were in poverty. Despite the lavish protection bestowed
              upon them by tariff laws at the solicitation of monopolies which
              dictate our tariff policy, the men were afflicted with poverty
              in many forms. They were poor as to clothing, poor as to shelter,
              poor as to food, and to be more specific, they were in extreme
              poverty as to ice. When the summer months came they lacked this
              thing because they could not afford to buy, and they suffered.</p>
            <p>Owing to the undermining of the ground and the caving in of the
              surface here and there, there were great holes into which the snow
              and the rain fell in winter and froze, forming a passable quality
              of ice. Now it is frequently said that intelligence, industry,
              and thrift will abolish poverty. But these virtues were not successful
              among the men of whom I speak. They were intelligent enough to
              see that this ice if they saved it would abolish their poverty
              as to ice, and they were industrious enough and thrifty enough
              not only to be willing to save it, but actually to begin the work.
              Preparing little caves to preserve the ice in, they went into the
              holes after a long day's work in the mines, and gathered what so
              far as the need of ice was concerned was to abolish their poverty
              in the ensuing summer. But the owner of this part of the earth &#8212; a
              man who had neither made the earth, nor the rain, nor the snow,
              nor the ice, nor even the hole &#8212; telegraphed his agent forbidding
              the removal of ice except upon payment of a certain sum per ton.</p>
            <p>The miners couldn't afford the condition. They controlled the
              necessary Labor, and were willing to give it to abolish their poverty;
              but the Land was placed beyond their reach by an owner, and in
              consequence of that, and not from any lack of intelligence, industry,
              or thrift on their own part, their poverty as to ice was perpetuated.

            <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
            <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law,
              99 thereby creating social disorder and inviting social disease.
              Upon society alone, therefore, and not upon divine Providence which
              has provided bountifully, nor upon the disinherited poor, rests
              the responsibility for poverty and fear of poverty.</p>

              <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to

                  of what is probably the deepest truth we can grasp. That alone
                  is wise which is just; that alone is enduring which is right.
                  In the narrow scale of individual actions and individual life
                  this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider field of
                  national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

            <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning
              with the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take
              possession of the best land. But instead of leaving for others
              what they do not themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations,
              they appropriate the whole space, using only part, but claiming
              ownership of the rest. We may distinguish the used part with red

              [chart]</p>
            <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than
              is used? Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary
              benefit of future social growth. What will enable them to secure
              that? Our system of confiscating Rent from the community that earns
              it, and giving it to land-owners who, as such, earn nothing.100</p>

                  of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right
                  of discovery, nor by right of labor, could the workman have
                  the money, because the title to the meteorite was in the man
                  who owned the land upon which it fell.</font></p>

            <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come,
              instead of finding half of the best land still common and free,
              as in the corresponding chart on page 68, they find all of it owned,
              and are obliged either to go upon poorer land or to buy or rent
              from owners of the best. How much will they pay for the best? Not
              more than 1, if they want it for use and not to hold for a higher
              price in the future, for that represents the full difference between
              its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But
              if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon
              be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or
              to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land of
              the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently
              land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
            <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary
              it cannot be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited
              by the superiority of the best land over that which can be had
              for nothing, and the chart may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
            <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best
              land in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure
              of labor force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not
              to use it that it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to
              put Rent into their own pockets as soon as growing demand for land
              makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose that all
              the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
              thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
            <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there
              is no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior
              land for higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill,
              is like owning lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps,
              but not profitable. But let more land be needed for use, and matters
              promptly assume a different appearance. The new labor must either
              go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from owners of
              better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
              case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get
              more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as
              Rent, either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower
              Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>

                  frequently is, capitalized for the purpose of selling the right

                  selling value will be the capitalization of its present or

                  exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for nothing

                  physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy
                  or whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If

                  . . . we see that things having some form of utility or desirability,
                  are valuable or not valuable, as they are hard or easy to get.
                  And if we ask further, we may see that with most of the things
                  that have value this difficulty or ease of getting them, which
                  determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
                  be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the
                  place, form and condition in which they are desired. . . Value
                  is simply an expression of the labor required for the production
                  of such a thing. But there are some things as to which this
                  is not so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective
                  of any improvements that labor has made on it, often has value.
                  . . Yet a little examination will show that such facts are
                  but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
                  rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the
                  universal law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced
                  by labor, from a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate
                  structure and appurtenances of a first-class ocean steamer,
                  is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the labor required
                  to produce such a thing in form and place; while the value
                  of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
                  of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent
                  of the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the
                  owner to obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher,

            <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
              Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the
              space, but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither
              Rent nor Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might
              be.</p>
            <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used,
              indicated with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by
              the mere appropriation of space, indicated with blue, that they
              would reach if all the space above the poorest were fully used.
              It thereby appears that under a system which confiscates Rent to
              private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes becomes
              so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if
              land were appropriated only for use.</p>
            <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use
              we have as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now
              assume as before (page 73), that social growth increases the productive
              power of the given expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied
              to the best land, 50 when applied to the next best, 10 to the next,
              3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would not be benefited
              now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation
              of land for use only, although much less land is actually used.
              The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
              men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to
              make it more than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth
              grade would be taken up in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus
              labor&quot; would be crowded out to the open space that originally
              yielded nothing, but which in consequence of increased labor power
              now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally yielded,
              namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
              then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space.

            <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is
              the least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the
              downward movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They
              cannot fall below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter
              how much productive power may increase, so long as it pays to hold
              land for higher values. Some laborers would continually be pushed
              back to land which increased productive power would have brought
              up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition
              for work would so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure
              of labor force, however much it produced, could nowhere secure
              more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would persist until
              some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase in productive
              power, would not yield the accustomed living without increase of
              labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
              to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over
              and over again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of
              land were monopolized, until human endurance could go no further.104

                  expense of cultivation, that they do not increase the profits
                  of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but that &quot;the
                  landlord will receive in addition to the rent already paid
                  to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This

                  additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance in
                  land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency
                  can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
                  a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor
                  and capital as the condition of engaging in production. If
                  it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were
                  reached, it would be possible to continuously increase rent
                  until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot

                  at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a
                  limit which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence,
                  speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries
                  where wages and interest are already near the minimum, as in
                  countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
                  is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the
                  speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit where production
                  would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial

                  and with all grades of laborers. This tendency continues until

              A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax,
              it is a burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted
              upon their tenants; most landlords who let land and also the tenement
            houses and business blocks thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>... </strong>I do not
              think the Leader of the Opposition could have chosen a
                        more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the
              demand of that great community for land was for not more than forty
              acres a
                        year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow
              for land? Does that really represent the complete economic and
              natural demand for
                        the amount of land a population of that size requires
              to live on? I will admit that at present prices it may be all that
              they can afford
                        to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one
              hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in
              one-room
                        tenements; and we are told that the utmost land
              those people can absorb economically and naturally is forty acres
              a year.</small></div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the explanation? Because
                        the population is congested in
                        the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
                        price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
                        congested within the city. That is the position which we are
                        complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
          hitherto dominated civilised society.</small></p>
          <p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>But
                        when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this
                        unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
                        unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
                        any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
                        forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
                        actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
          argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the widow</span>.
                        But that personality has been used to
                        exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,
                        overtime of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so
                        soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
                        market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
                        the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
                        expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
          life should become larger than it is at present.</small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the position disclosed
                        by the argument? On the one hand,
                        we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
                        one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
                        two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
                        sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
                        within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
                        of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
                        social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
                        market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
                        spreads and who would not really be in the least injured. </small><small>...

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Everybody nowadays is anxious to help
          do something for the poor, especially they who are on the backs of
          the poor; they will do anything
                  that is not fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor
          a chance to help themselves. The reformers in this state have passed
                  a law prohibiting women from working more than eight hours
          in one
                  day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love to
                  work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen
                  see fit to
                  come here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back
                  where they came from.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects
                by curing the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the
                world is the product of law, and you cannot cure it without curing
                the cause. Lawyers, as a class, are very stupid. What would you think
                of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria, instead of draining
                the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the swamp where
                it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
                symptoms.</div>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">No man created the earth, but to a large
          extent all take from the earth a portion of it and mould it into useful
          things for the use
                of man. Without land man cannot live; without access to it man
          cannot labor. First of all, he must have the earth, and this he cannot
          have
                access to until the single tax is applied. It has been proven
          by the history of the human race that the single tax does work, and
                that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man turned
                from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered
                the great continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable
                employment, he went on the free land and worked for himself,
          and
                in those early days there were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully
                rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because there was cheap land.
                Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the surplus off
                the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
                only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly
                was complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to
                a boss for a job.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor
                  when the earth is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they
                  must till
                the soil, dig the coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men
                know it, and cunning men know it, and so a few have reached out their
                hands and grasped the earth; and they say, &quot;These mines of coal
                and iron, which it took nature ages and ages to store, belong to
                me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay the tribute

    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">About this matter of wages, George had
          had other testimony besides the old printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a dozen years before,
                he fell in with a lot of miners who were talking about the Chinese,
                and ventured to ask what harm the Chinese were doing as long as they
                worked only the cheap diggings. &#8220;No harm now,&#8221; one of
                the miners said, &#8220;but wages will not always be as high
                as they are today in California. <a href="Population_Growth.html">As
                the country grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>,
                and some day or other white people will be glad to get those
                diggings
                that the Chinamen are working.&#8221; George said that this idea,
                coming on top of what the printer had said, made a great impression
                on him &#8212; the idea that &#8220;<a href="Progress.html">as
                the country grew in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>,
                the condition of those who had to work for their living must
                become, not better, but worse.&#8221; Yet in the short space
                of a dozen years this was precisely what was taking place before
                his own eyes.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Still, though his two great questions
          became more and more pressing, he could not answer them. His thought
          was still inchoate. He went
                around and around his ultimate answer, like somebody fumbling
          after something on a table in the dark, often actually touching it
          without
                being aware that it was what he was after. Finally it came to
          him in a burst of true Cromwellian or Pauline drama out of &#8220;the
                commonplace reply of a passing teamster to a commonplace question.&#8221; One
                day in 1871 he went for a horseback ride, and as he stopped to
                rest his horse on a rise overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</div>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <div style="text-align: left;">&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better
                    to say, what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing
                    so far off that they looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t
                    know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell some
                    land for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like a flash
                    it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty
                    with advancing
                    wealth. <a href="Population_Growth.html">With the growth
                    of population</a>, land grows in value, and the men who work
                    it must pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly shot up so high in California
                in 1849 that cooks in the restaurants of San Francisco got $500 a
                month? The reason now was simple and clear. It was because the placer
                mines were found on <a href="Land_Common_Property.html">land
                that did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and
                work them without having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the
                lands had been owned by somebody, it would have been land-values
                instead of wages that would have so suddenly shot up.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Exactly this was what had taken place
          on these grazing lands overlooking San Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific
          meant to make its terminus
                at Oakland, the increased population would need the land around
          Oakland to settle on, and land values had jumped up to a thousand dollars
                an acre. Naturally, then, George reasoned, the more public improvements
                there were, the better the transportation facilities, the larger
                the population, the more industry and commerce &#8212; the more of
                everything that makes for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the
                more would land values tend to rise, and the more would wages
                and interest
                tend to fall.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">George rode home thoughtful, translating
          the teamster&#8217;s commonplace
                reply into the technical terms of economics. He reasoned that
          there are <a href="Three-Factor_Economics.html">three factors
                in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural resources,
                labor, and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated,
                obviously the whole yield of production is divided into wages,
                which go to
                labor, and interest, which goes to capital. But when they are
                appropriated, production has to carry a third charge &#8212; <a href="Rent.html">rent</a>.
                Moreover, wages and interest, when there is no rent, are regulated
                strictly by free competition; but rent is a monopoly-charge,
                and hence is always &#8220;all the traffic will bear.&#8221;</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Well, then, since <a href="Natural_Resources.html">natural
                  resource values</a> are purely social in their origin, created
                  by the community, should not rent go to the community rather than
                  to the Individual? <a href="../themes/Untaxing.html">Why tax industry
                  and enterprise at all</a> &#8212; why not just charge rent?
                  There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership
                  of natural
                  resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his hands on,
                  and make as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but let him
                  pay the
                  community their annual rental value, determined simply by what
                  other people would be willing to pay for the use of the same
                  holdings. George could see justification for wages and interest,
                  on the ground
                  of natural right; and for private ownership of natural resources,
                  on the ground of public policy; but he could see none for the
                  private appropriation of economic rent. In his view it was
                  sheer <a href="../themes/Theft.html">theft</a>.
                  If he was right, then it also followed that as long as economic
                  rent remains unconfiscated, <a href="../themes/Piracy.html">the
                  taxation of industry and enterprise is pure highwaymanry</a>, especially <a href="../themes/Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation,
                  for this virtually delegates the government&#8217;s taxing
                  power to private persons.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">George worked out these ideas in a tentative
          way in a forty-eight page pamphlet with the title, &#8220;<em>Our Land and Land Policy,
                National and State</em>,&#8221; which did not reach many readers,
                but added something to his reputation as a tribune of the people.
                The subject mulled in his mind through five years of newspaper work,
                at the end of which he lost his paper and was once more on the ragged
                edge. He had begun a magazine article on the cause of industrial
                depressions, but was dissatisfied with it &#8212; one could do
                nothing with the topic in so little space. What was needed was
                a solid treatise
                which should recast the whole science of political economy.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">He felt that he could write this treatise,
          but how were he and his family to live meanwhile? He had used his influence
          on the Democratic
                side in the last State campaign, and had been particularly instrumental
                in selecting the governor; so he wrote to Governor Irwin, asking
                him &#8220;to give me a place where there was little to do and something
                to get, so that I could devote myself to some important writing.&#8221; The
                governor gave him the State inspectorship of gas meters, which
                was a moderately well-paid job, and a sinecure. This was in January,

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Go to the work of Henry George himself and learn how many of the troubles
              from which society still suffers, and suffers increasingly, are due
              to the fact that a few have monopolized the land, and that in consequence
              they have the power to dictate to others access to the land and to
              its products -- which include waterpower, electricity, coal, iron and
              all minerals, as well as the foods that sustain life -- and that they
              have the power to appropriate to their private use the values that
              the industry, the civilized order, the very benefactions, of others
              produce. This wrong is at the very basis of our present social and
              economic chaos, and until it is righted, all steps toward economic
              recovery may be temporarily helpful while in the long run useless.

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are defenders of
                              capitalism who attack Geonomics (Georgist
                              economics) for being socialist. Similarly, socialists and communists
                              criticise Geonomics for being capitalist - in fact, Marx called Henry
                              George "capitalism's last ditch". Who is right?<br>
            <br>
            </small><small>"Capitalism" is a woolly word, meaning different things
                              to different
                              people. Geonomists wouldn't criticise capitalism per se, but rather
                              decry "land monopoly capitalism".</small><br>

            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEN TOO MUCH IS BARELY ENOUGH</span></small><br>
            <small>Whatever is wrong with the acquisition of capital? Who would not
                              want
                              to afford a roof over one's head, adequate food and clothing, some
                              means of transportation, a decent education, and to go travelling and
                              see the world? I've put this question innumerable times to
                              self-declared opponents of capitalism - many of them very well read -
                              and have never received any sort of adequate rebuttal. The response is
                              usually along the lines of: "Well, some capital like that is OK, but
                              nobody should have too much capital". In the final analysis, "too much"
            capital means any amount more than the speaker's!</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The flaw here, as we
                              see it,
                              is that socialists do not make the vital distinction between earned and
          unearned wealth when they attack the owners of capital.</span> </small></div>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>Was this accumulated capital honestly earned in a free and
                            a fair market?

            <li><small>Was there no monopolistic privilege? 
            </small></li>

            <small>As we see it, if someone is a rich "capitalist" who has
                              accumulated a
                              fortune, say, by being a great inventor, author, sportsperson or a
                              plain hard worker who lives frugally, then "God bless him!" If they
                              then want to live in a big house and drive a big car, then "Good luck
                              to 'em!" They've provided services that actually benefit society in a
                              truly free and fair market, and they'd pay their way in the form of
            LVT. We need more such capitalists!</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The other capitalists are a different kettle of fish. Reaping
                              where you
                              don't sow is not in the Geonomic bible, and the full retention of the
                              economic rent for the benefit of society would leave absolutely nothing
                              for the cigar-chomping, would-be robber barons. But let's not forget
                              the subtle forms of speculation and unearned wealth as practiced even
                              by well-meaning citizens by speculating in one form or another.
                              Unfortunately, the "quick bucks" culture is not promoted only in
                              investment circles. Even the nightly news promotes, and even glorifies,
                              speculative profits without ever questioning where the wealth comes
                              from.&nbsp; ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

            <small>LVT and its 19th-century champion, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Henry
                              George</a>,
                              achieved huge acclaim before being buried by the "purpose-built" body
                              of neoclassical economics financed largely by rent-seeking American
                              plutocrats.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small>
            In one form or another, Henry George's writings on the need to tax land
                              values was preceded or endorsed by various biblical prophets, and by
                              Carlyle, Churchill, Einstein, Franklin, Aldous Huxley, Jefferson,
                              Lincoln, Locke, J.S. Mill, Paine, Penn, Rousseau, Bertrand Russell,
                              Adam Smith, Spencer, Spinoza, Sun Yat Sen, James Tobin, Tolstoy, Twain,
                              Voltaire, Winstanley, Frank Lloyd Wright and many more.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19]</span></small>
            Just how this wisdom has been lost sight of is a long - too long for
            this paper - and tragic story.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Here, for this conference, is the quirk - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">environmental
                              considerations played almost no part in the compelling endorsements
                              lavished on LVT! The main bill, then and now, is its powerful
                              explanation of the great causes of social injustice, with the second
                              billing going to an exposure of a whole range of economic
                              inefficiencies and deadweight losses of our present economic system,
                              which should more accurately be termed land-monopoly capitalism.</span>
            Support acts include libertarian ideals (non-intrusive tax systems),
                              effective Third World Aid, an end to tax evasion, contributions to
            world peace, and an end to boom &amp; bust cycles.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The appeal of LVT to some others is more its philosophical basis
                              and
                              how its implementation must turn the economy the right way up, such
                              that the cause of the "madness" (because completely unnecessary) of
                              involuntary unemployment is eliminated, which of necessity then leads
            to the range of benefits just mentioned.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>This is not a meandering departure from the subject of this
                              conference.
                              No significant, effectual solutions can be made to our environment if
                              the all-embracing economic system is only nibbled at, piecemeal, from
            the angle of taxation alone.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>LVT is not a mere taxation solution, but an integrated economic
                              solution, impacting on land management and cutting at the heart of
                              privilege and injustice. Yes, environmental tax reformers must indeed
                              address the looting of undervalued natural resources driven by
                              bourgeois habits of overconsumption. Let us not, however, overlook the
                              destruction resulting from short-term perspectives driven by poverty
            and desperation. LVT deals with both worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

                              MENACE OF MONOPOLY</span></small><br>
            <small>Land effectively behaves as a monopoly good - the rent is not
                              determined by any cost of production, for it is already the highest
                              price that anyone will offer for it. There is no substitute for the
                              valuable land that individuals and businesses need - one can't go out
            into the desert and haul in prime real estate!</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The LVT would not somehow increase the willingness of anyone to
                              pay
                              more for the land than before, nor would it in any way add to the
                              ability of the owner to demand more. To suppose that LVT could be just
                              offloaded on tenants is to suppose that landowners did not already get
                              for their land all that it brought. In other words, it supposes that,
            whenever they wanted to, landowners could put up prices as they please!</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A PARADOX</span></small><br>
            <small>Here's the paradoxical twist. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">As
                              far as one can predict, LVT would - in a country like Australia, with
                              so much valuable unused land - tend strongly to lower rents. Owners of
                              unused land who previously were holding out for higher prices would now
                              be driven by LVT to seek purchasers or tenants, thereby having to lower
                              the asking price.</span> And, for land which is being rented, the
                              landowner would have to forfeit part or all of his cut to the
                              government. However the selling price of land, determined by net rents
                              to the landowner, would necessarily be much diminished (with full LVT
            collection, the selling price would be around zero).</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Radical as Geonomics is, here - contrary to appearances - we are
                              not
                              arguing about anything contentious or new. It is generally conceded by
                              knowledgeable economists that the landlord cannot transfer taxes levied
                              upon rent to the tenant. It is accepted that a tax upon anything of
                              which the supply is fixed or monopolised, and of which its cost of
                              production is not therefore a determining element (since it has no
                              effect in checking supply), does not increase prices and falls entirely
            on the owner.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;&nbsp; <span

          Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
                          Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
          </a>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The justice in the Georgist
                              tradition grows out of the premise that one
                              is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
                              not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
                              Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
                              inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
                              involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
                              interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
                              world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
                              local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
                              self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
                              state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
                              pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
                              great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
                              solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
                              to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
                              private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
                              exploring commonalities.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>&nbsp;
            Alternatives that have been tried in the past, both classic capitalism
                              and socialism, suggest that neither has served the interests of
                              humanity well in the long term. Ecological economics has no theory of
                              property as such, and Georgism here offers a proven course of
                              application. To Georgists, ownership is linked to use and not to
                              freehold title. Holding individual property under license of the
                              community, and under terms which the community stipulates, is an idea
                              with a long tradition, well accepted, and needing only to be revived in
                              contemporary political, legal and economic discourse. Combined with the
                              pricing device of collecting land rent, ecological economics will have
                              a tool by which to circumscribe and even reverse the centrifugal forces
                              of a new economic imperialism. This is truly the beginning of a &#8220;Third
          Way&#8221; when other theories seem to be moribund. ... <a

          <p>One could argue that the failure to tax
            every bit of economic rent that accretes to land sites also has destructive
            consequences, although
                  this is somewhat open to debate. Classical economists agree
            that rent collection ought to be at least the sum of inflation plus
            interest, otherwise the public is facilitating speculation in ways
            that distorts
                  urban configurations even more than they constitute an inequity.
                  But land sites frequently rise in market price far more than
            the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true today)
                  that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
                  Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts
                  of US, are today claiming to have increases in housing prices
                  of
                  as high
                  as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely will not last
                  and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
                  values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing
                  depreciation just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other
                  manufactured (capital) item. Recovering the economic rent reduces
                  and perhaps even eliminates the speculative bubbles and swings that
                  (some argue) account for economic cycles, fostering stability and
                  regularity in economic planning and development that make for improved
                financial health to all.</strong></p>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">This reality brings into stark relief
          the choices which local political leaders have. They may suggest increasing
          taxes on economic rent
                (i.e., on land value) or recognize that most property owners
          are counting on treating their homes and other property not as places
                to live and work so much as investments and then lament the poverty
                of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain from their property
                when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any threat
                to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes
          regard
                selling their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners
          sell with the expectation that this gain will provide them the means
          to
                enter long term end-of-life facilities if necessary. Heirs also
          oppose that recapture just as with a reverse mortgage. <strong>But
          for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
          benefit
                of increased
                rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
                not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that
                are prohibited from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively
                expensive costs. In this sense, a title to a socially created
                stream
                of rental benefits constitutes a monopoly privilege to an unearned
                windfall gain for a lucky few. It is both unjust and is socially
                and economically destructive to the greater good. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEOCLASSICAL LAND-MONOPOLY CAPITALIST</span><br>
            You have two cows and several hectares of land.</p>
            <p>Your neighbour is a single mother, has no cows, no land and works a part-time
            job.</p>
            <p>You tell her that if she works longer and harder she could buy one of your
                              cows and become an enterprising capitalist. So she takes on full-time work
            so that, after 3 months, she has saved enough money to buy one of your cows.</p>
            <p>But what use is a cow (or anything, for that matter) without a plot of your
            land, which is now worth $20,000?</p>
            <p>So your neighbour takes on a night shift in addition to her day job, leaving
                              for work after the kids are in bed and arriving home just in time to get
            them dressed for school.</p>
            <p>After a year she has saved enough money to buy that land.</p>
            <p>Expressing great regret you explain that, in the meantime, the taxes on
                              her income have paid for the infrastructure that have boosted the value of
                              your land, so that the current market price for that plot is now worth $30,000.
            Back to the grindstone, baby!</p>
            <p> Another year of sweat and toil follows, after which she returns with the
                              money. But, with hand on heart, you break the news that economic circumstances
                              have recently driven most single and married mothers to bring in an extra
                              income in order to save for the ever-escalating price of land. As no-one&#8217;s
                              making any more land, the greater number of bidders has pushed up the price
                              of the fixed amount of land (this is called a &#8220;healthy, buoyant property
                              market&#8221;). It&#8217;s now worth $40,000 but it would be a lot easier
                              if she just got a bank loan, you tell her. However, all those eager bidders
                              for land have also bid up the rate of interest they&#8217;re prepared to
                              suffer, so that interest rates are now prohibitive. Your neighbour collapses
                              in tears at your feet, but what can you do? &#8211; you didn&#8217;t invent
                              the system! Just as our poor mum relents and considers taking out a mortgage,
                              she finally gets some good news &#8211; in a surprise move, the Reserve Bank
                              has decided to make it easier on prospective home-owners by reducing interest
                              rates. However, this has had the effect of making the owning of property
                              more attractive, so &#8211; immediately the interest rate decision is announced &#8211; landowners
                              raise the selling price of land. The &#8220;fair market price&#8221; of that
                              plot is now $50,000.<br>
              <br>
              However, under political pressure because of the unaffordability of property,
                              the federal government announce that it will institute a First Home Owners&#8217; grant
                              of $7,000. Suddenly that plot is selling for $57,000.<br>

                              in all its glory and realise that all other reforms are just band-aids, so
                              you become an activist with ProsperAustralia. You share your insight with
                              your neighbour and so everyone pulls together to successfully reform our

              (1) your neighbour can keep all of her hard-earned income, and<br>

              <br>
              Your LVT bill arrives and you realise you have been holding more land than
                              you really need, so auction off the title to your land and the improvements
                              on it. Because of genuine tax relief, your neighbour can now afford to buy

          <p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
              Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid
              out of the products of labor. But must they be for that reason
              a tax on labor products. Let us see. </p>
            <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different
              kinds of land will give very different results. Suppose that a
              unit of labor produces on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on
              D's 1. A's land is the most, and D's is the least, productive land
              in use in the community to which they belong. B's and C's represent
              intermediate grades. Suppose each occupies the best land that was
              open to him when he entered into possession. Now, B, and C, and
              D have just as good a right to the use of the best land as A had. </p>
            <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality
              of opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results,
              all other things being equal except the land. </p>
            <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible
              way. Each must surrender for the common use of all, himself included,
              whatever advantages accrues to him from the possession of land
              superior to that which falls to the lot of him who occupies the
              poorest. </p>
            <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is
              what it should produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have
              an advantage of natural opportunity over D. </p>
            <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common
              fund for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging
              a well, making a road or bridge, building a school, or other public
              utility. </p>
            <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into
              a common fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their
              labor products (though paid out of them) but a tax on the superior
              advantage which they enjoy over D, and to which D has just as good
              a right as any of them. </p>
            <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of
              the best land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what
              he cannot so use he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at
              no disadvantage with the rest who have come in ahead of him, for
              they provide for him, in proportion to their respective advantages,
              those public utilities which invariably arise wherever men live
              in communities. Of course he will in turn hold to those who come
              later the same relation that those who came earlier held to him. </p>
            <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead
              of land; all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the
              tax is to produce little or nothing. He could just squat on his
              land, neither using it himself nor letting others use it, but he
              would not stop at this, for he would grab to the last acre all
              that he could possibly get hold of. Each of the others would do
              the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by, E, F and
              G would find no land left for them on which they might make a living. </p>
            <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already
              monopolized the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from
              them. Behold now the devil of landlordism getting his hoof on God's
              handiwork! Exit justice, freedom, social peace and plenty. Enter
              robbery, slavery, social discontent, consuming grief, riotous but
              unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime breeding, want, the
              beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
            <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing
              labor products in order that precious landlordism might laugh and
              grow fat on the bovine stupidity of the community that contributes
              its own land values toward its own enslavement! </p>
            <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
            <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this
              four-fold difference. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
              <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
              <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously
                damnable difference; </li>
              <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding
                their families in want on the one hand, and unused land that
                would yield them abundance on the other. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance,
              and if it does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able
              to draw his robe close around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's
              none of my fault; I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

            <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements
              of any sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice
              is explained largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in
              the recent century or two have buildings represented any significant
              capital value; prior to the rise of major cities, the value of
              real property lay essentially in land. American cities today typically
              record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least when the
              valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
              value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers
              reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
              because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets
              its market price from the fact that the total neighborhood context
              creates an attractive market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings,
              however, we impose a penalty on their optimum development as well
              as on the incentives for their maintenance. Moreover, taxes on
              buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise be imposed
              on sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and
              best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
              challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
              particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting
              purposes, evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact
              most costs associated with administration of property taxation
              and appeal litigation involve disputes over the valuation of structures,
            not land values.</p>
            <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles.
              Locations are the beneficiaries of community services whether they
              are improved or not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer
              and others elsewhere,32 a tax on land value conforms to all the
              textbook principles of sound tax theory. Some further considerations
              are worth reviewing, however, when looking at ground rent as a
              flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock. The technical
              ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
              as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to
              those sites &#8211; by the application of GIS (geographic information
              systems) real-time recording of sales transactions invites wholesale
              changes in the maintenance of cadastral data. The transmittal of
              sales records as typically received in the offices of local governments
              for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
              allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market
              values. Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land
              value proportions reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
              easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common
              geographic features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of
              ground rent through local or regional economies, and can also be
              used to identify the areas of greatest market vitality and enterprise.
              The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed in ways that overcomes
              the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income is recognized
              as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood as
              such.</p>
            <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
              what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered
              this more than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps,
              than anyone has since. He recognized full well that the economic
              surplus not expended by human hands or minds in the production
              of capital wealth gravitates to land. Particular land sites come
              to reflect the value of their strategic location for market exchanges
              by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless whether
              those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
              of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate
              with their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than
              a century ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their
              sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase in
              the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire
              community, should belong to the community and not to the individual
              who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery by taxation
              this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
              situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental
              value is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching
              a market price and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls
              for the recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation.
              Moreover, the failure to recover the land rent connected to sites
              makes it necessary to tax productive activities in our economy,
              and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight
              loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
            <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production
              not created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to
              buy or sell as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson
              a century earlier, &#8220;The earth belongs in usufruct to the
              living; . . . [It is] given as a common stock for men to labor
              and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a bit of parsing
              for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since Roman
              times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
              to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
              Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common
              stock;&#8221; not allotted to individuals with possessory titles.
              Only the phrase &#8220;to the living&#8221; might be subject to
              challenge by forward-looking environmentalists who, taking an idea
              from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do not inherit
              the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
              presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately
              is a claim that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles
              owe their origin ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
            <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and
              the rent that derives from those sites is due to community enterprise,
              it is not a large logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s
              recovery of that rent should be the proper source of taxation.
              This is the Georgist argument: that the recapture of land rent
              is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source of taxation.38
