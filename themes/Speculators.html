<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, <strong>and even the expectation
    of improvement</strong>,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. <strong>But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find
    the speculator has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and
    has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. </strong>Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads,<strong> is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased
    value which they give to land? </strong>To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. <strong>But
    this great public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because
    these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots.</strong> The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. <strong>It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</strong></p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    Cannot Shift The Tax on Land Values</a> (1887)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land upon which there is no
taxation even a
poor man can easily hold for higher prices, for land eats nothing.
But put heavy taxation upon it, and even a rich man will be driven to
seek purchasers or tenants, and to get them he will have to put down
the price he asks, instead of putting it up; for it is by asking
less, not by asking more, that those who have anything they are
forced to dispose of must seek customers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rather than continue to pay
heavy taxes upon land yielding him nothing, and from the future
increase in value of which he could have no expectation of profit,
since increase in value would mean increased taxes, he would be glad
to give it away</span> or let it revert to the State. Thus the dogs in
the
manger, who all over the country are withholding land that they
cannot use themselves from men who would be glad to use it, would be
forced to let go their grasp. To tax Land Values up to anything like
their full amount would be to utterly destroy speculative values, and
to diminish all rents into which this speculative element enters. ...<a

Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in
this world, and in our civilization. There is a provision made by the
laws of the Creator which would secure to the helpless all that they
require, which would give enough and more than enough for all social
purposes. These little children that are dying in our crowded districts
for want of room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a
great estate.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Did you ever consider the full
meaning of the significant fact that as progress goes on, as population
increases and civilization develops, the one thing that ever increases
in value is land?</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> there the
speculator jumps in, land rises in value, and a great boom takes place,
and people find themselves enormously rich without ever having done a
single thing to produce wealth.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that land steadily
increases in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to
it; that the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s
goodness in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use
adds to the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This
natural fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law
of the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is the intent of this natural law of increasing land
values? Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land
values grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to society as a whole, with which we
may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with which we may meet
public expenses, and do all the things that an advancing civilization
makes more and more necessary for society to do on behalf of its
members?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Today the value of land in New York city is over a hundred
million annually. Who has created that value? Is it because a few
landowners are here that that land is worth a hundred million a year?
Is it not because the whole population of New York is here? Is it not
because this great city is the center of exchanges for a large portion
of the continent? Does not every child that is born, every one that
comes to settle in New York, does it not add to the value of this land?
Ought it not, therefore, get some portion of the benefit? And is it not
wronged when, instead of being used for that purpose, certain favored
individuals are allowed to appropriate the fund of land values?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production....&nbsp;<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/George_TSNS.html"> <span

Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever there
is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a great
city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the bounty
of the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or an oil
well, or a gas deposit,</div>

  Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
  Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
  V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse.</p>
    <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must
        draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
        the
        supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
        the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
        the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,
        to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
        of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
        to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
        rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
        wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
        go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
        those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land
        and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among
        all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
        of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/debate_hyndman_1889.html">The Great
Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy</a>&nbsp; (1889)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What we want is full
competition.
(Hear, hear.) What we want to do is to abolish monopolies, and it is
to these monopolies, and not to the earnings of capital, that the
great fortunes to which my opponent has alluded are due. </small><br>
<br>
<small>What are the
causes of these big fortunes? In the United States, go wherever you
please, you find that the real element is land ownership. It is a
great mistake to think that the only landlords are those which pose
as such. today, who are the great owners of the Irish estates? Not
so much the Irish landlords as the English banks and insurance
societies. (Hear, hear.) Take our, Jay Gould, the most conspicuous
example of a great fortune made outside the rise of land values. He
made his first stride by getting hold of a piece of land and taking
advantage of its rise in value, and he is today the owner of
millions of acres. He made his money in what? In a public franchise,
that we would abolish.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>What has the
deterioration in the condition of our farms been caused by? Not, as
Mr Hyndman says, by any exploiting power of capital, but by the
monopolisation of land, and by the taxes levied on industry (Hear,
hear.) What do these great farms come from? They come from the great
railroad grants. (Hear, hear.) They come from the system permitted
under the land-laws of the United States, under which single
individuals have taken hundreds of thousands of acres. And from the
same cause comes the mortgage on the farms. Wherever the farmer goes
he finds the speculator ahead of him, he finds the land already taken
up, and he must either start with capital and pay a large sum for the
purpose of getting virgin soil to cultivate, or he must mortgage his
labour for years. That is what he does. (Hear; hear.) The real cause
is in the high purchase price, of his land, and that is why times
have been getting harder in the United States. Then I am asked, how
can a man using a spade compete with this great machinery of the
5,000 acre farm? This, at least, he can do; he can make a living and
a good living, too; and when men can make a good living themselves
they will not work for anything less than that for any capitalist.

A. Possibly. But that has no bearing upon the question. What men lose through
investments in land, the community does not gain; but what they gain the community
does lose. Therefore, as between land speculators and the community, the losses
cannot be charged against the gains.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Making Housing
Affordable</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The implementation of our ideas
would have a dramatic effect in
making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held off the market by
speculators who may wait generations do decide to develop it.</span>
The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether used or not, equal
to the rental value of the land, will induce speculators to either
develop this land themselves or turn it over to someone who will.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who
wishes to own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying
the title to the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of
the house itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a
fee equal to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of
land titles became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a
family would have to borrow to purchase a house would fall. ...&nbsp; <a

Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These recurring spasms of business
stagnation; these long-drawn
periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do
not come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to
be cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and
what is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but
speculation in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor
and capital would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail
demanded for their employment in production, and the same round would
be run again. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There is but
one remedy, and that is what is now known
as the single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and
capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and the
taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the
mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. Charity can
merely demoralize and pauperize,</span> while that indirect form of
charity,
the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses
and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by
dynamite and kerosene.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is no need for charity;
no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. </span>The common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
speculation in land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But, it will be said, this is not
quick enough. On the contrary,
it is quicker than anything else. Even the public recognition of its
need, by but a part of the intelligence and influence that is now
devoted to charity appeals and schemes, would have such an effect
upon the speculative price of land as to at once set labor and
capital to work.<a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
    Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
    Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

George spoke for the
landless, the tenants, the young, the upwardly mobile, orphans with
nothing to inherit (as opposed to the mythical orphans who own all
the property in the country), the students and trainees, the
exploited workers, the innovators and entrepreneurs and adventurers
who turn their capital and turn the wheels of capitalism &#8211; not
so much for stolid settled burghers and retirees who own land.</span>
Their
buildings, yes, he would exempt. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But if those buildings rest on
land
of high social utility, they are playing the role of land
speculators.</span> Call them Type #3 speculators: the
&#8220;passive-aggressive&#8221; type. (For Types #1 and #2, see item
9, below.) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not that George or his
allies are against homeownership.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist tax reform makes it easier
for first-time buyers to enter
the market, and tends to raise the number of owner-occupants.</span>
However
that sometimes entails inducing Type #3 speculators, melded in among
existing homeowners, to let go of excess land they do not need. That
basic point gets lost when campaigners pitch their message solely to
existing homeowners, lumping them all as a class. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Folklore and commercial drama make
sympathetic figures of Type #3
speculators. Environmentalists cozy up to landed gentry as soon as
these set aside some land for wildlife, and abate the bloodlust of
their foxhunting. The challenge for educators and economists is to
explain that their role in the land market can be just as anti-social
as those who are more transparently aggressive and greedy. It is a
mighty challenge, I allow; but it is what&#8217;s out there, and we
must face it, or settle for tokenism that absorbs our lives and
resources while papering over the major issues.<big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></big><br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>9. Territorial
expansion:</b> Regional cross-subsidy, with subeconomic extension of
public works and services. George&#8217;s critique of land speculation
came to be focused on
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#1</b>,&#8221; who withholds good lands from timely use. Georgists
have neglected to condemn the counterpart
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#2</b>,&#8221; who acquires marginal lands cheaply, and then lobbies
public agencies to extend roads, utilities, military and police
protection, and other public services to them, below cost. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some Georgists may even see this
as a legitimate way, and an
easier way, to combat the artificial scarcity of land that Speculator
Type #1 causes &#8211; a way of perpetuating the &#8220;frontier
safety-valve.&#8221; However, it unbalances development severely: too
much roading, et al., too little use of the land thus &#8220;opened
up.&#8221; Some taxpayer must pay for the roading et al. If the taxes
are activity-based or improvement-based (i.e. anything but land
taxes) they will sterilize marginal land, and lower the intensity of
use of all land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a pervasive, immanent bias
in most of our institutions,
from city departments of public works up through state and provincial
public utilities commissions and highway departments, clear to the
Pentagon, World Bank, and CIA. Types #1 and #2, in tandem, create our
form of Imperialism, that perpetual quest for Lebensraum that is our
curse. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In my political experiences, one
collects more cuts and bruises
combating Speculators Type #2 than Type #1. I was, for example, able
to lead the local countywide campaign against Howard Jarvis&#8217;
&#8220;Proposition 13&#8221; without being seriously punished, but a
few years later when I led the campaign against southern
California&#8217;s favorite public water-works boondoggle, the
&#8220;Peripheral Canal,&#8221; my academic and professional world
collapsed about me. Earlier, when I joined the furor against American
imperialism (Gaffney, 1971) and the myth of infinite natural
resources (Gaffney, 1972), I became persona non grata at Resources
for the Future, Inc., where I then worked. In British Columbia, 1975,
I learned that the self-styled &#8220;socialist&#8221; government under
Premier David Barrett was unwilling even to consider withdrawing any
of its expensive cross-subsidies to speculators Type #2, and resented
me for raising the issue. The moose-pastures of northern B.C.
&#8220;are a mighty empire,&#8221; they told me, and the rich retirees
on the Gulf Islands are important constituents who should have both
their subsidized ferry service and their exclusionary zoning to keep
hoi polloi from sharing it. I have war stories, but the objective
point is that the socio-political bias for territorial expansion is
even stronger than the bias against cultivating, intensifying and
renewing our internal frontiers. The Georgist dream of taxing central
rents to finance public services becomes a nightmare when the public
money is dissipated in enriching Speculators Type #2. This kind of
spending not only dissipates rents, and wastes capital, at the same
time it despoils the environment. Worst of all, as the subeconomic
land development proceeds, each new settlement makes a platform for
the next, so there is no end to it short of the limits of capital and
of Earth. It is perhaps fortunate for Earth that, historically, the
limits of capital have been reached first, at the ends of bursts of
territorial overexpansion. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Socialism," in common usage, is
a Protean word, slippery and
shifting. Many use it without defining it, whether from innocence,
negligence, or cunning. These many include not just the vulgar, but
most economists: semantic care is weak in the traditions of the
profession. "Rigorous" model-builders today are among the offenders:
the premium is on gilding the superstructure, neglecting the
foundation. Indeed, foundations are not even needed for models that
float in outer space, vouching for and communing mainly with each
other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who do define Socialism,
explicitly or implicitly, use the
word for different things. A major difference, treated here, is
between <b><i>Managerial Socialism</i></b> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">(who decides)</span>
and
<b><i>Distributive Socialism</i><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> (who gets)</span></b>. These may
overlap,
but are independent of each other and often conflict. For example,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Riverside, CA, owns its own electric
utility </span>(on whose Board I sit,
losing battles). This is Managerial Socialism, municipal style. Its
traditional rate structure includes large elements of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cross-subsidy,
mainly taking from the lower middles for the rich, tempered by crumbs
thrown to the very poor. </span>The same is true of our water system,
and of
most municipally owned and managed utilities around the nation. Water
and sewer service are common examples of Managerial Socialism (from
which the mnemonic "sewer socialism"). They have little in common
with Distributive Socialism. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">At
higher levels of government, also, Managerial Socialism may
play reverse Robin Hood.</span> In British Columbia the "Socred"
(right-wing) party in the 1960s socialized the ferry service, the
provincial railroad, and the electric utility (now B.C. Hydro), using
them in<span style="font-weight: bold;"> schemes to enrich land
speculators.</span> To boost along B.C. Hydro
they raided the teachers' pension fund, borrowing from it at rates
near zero. The New Democratic Party
(NDP) (left-wing), taking power
in 1972, ended the raid on teachers, but not the cross-subsidy. In
California, the State Department of
Water Resources (DWR) designed,
built, and operates the California
Water Plan (CWP) for the primary
gain of a handful of giant landowners. They, too, raided education,
taking certain State oil revenues (known as the COPHE fund)
previously earmarked for The University of California. Such examples
could, of course, be extended at length.</small> <small>... <a href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Gaffney_OaGL.html"

certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity. </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>

monopolization of land rights, large segments of humanity are
oppressed, dehumanized, held in bondage. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One factor enabling governments to legalize
land theft and lend respectability to exploitative landlordism is the
general silence of religious and intellectual leaders about humanity's
common rights to land.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>We begin to penetrate and overcome this silence when we realize
that the Wasteland is wasted land, unfulfilled potential, producing no
"milk and honey."<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Speculators in both
urban and rural areas hoard land on which the hungry, the homeless, and
the jobless could feed, shelter, and employ themselves. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Keeping valuable lands idle causes
artificial shortages that drive up rents which poor people must pay for
poor land. </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land
hoarding deserves much of the blame for creating the Wasteland: it
forces people into the "desert." </span>There, people find the oases
controlled by more land monopolists who must be paid a ransom for
access to nature's life-sustaining water. And as we will see, the
primary focus of Biblical economic laws was the prevention of precisely
this sort of usurpation of God's gifts to all creatures. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
same God who established communities has also in his providence
ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live,
this revenue goes mainly into the pockets of monopolists,</span> while
communities meet their needs by extorting individuals the fruits of
their honest toil. If ever there were any doubt that structural sin
exists, our present system of taxation is the proof. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Everywhere we see governments penalizing
individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
the land which they withhold. </span>The greater the Wasteland, the
greater the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion
of justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This not meant to suggest that
land monopolists and speculators have a corner on acquisitiveness or
the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh universal fact of human
nature. As a group, they are no more sinful than are people at large,
except to the degree that they knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at
removing the basis of exploitation. Many abide by the dictum: "If one
has to live under a corrupt system, it is better to be a beneficiary
than a victim of it."</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But they do not have to live
under a corrupt system; no one does. The profit motive can be channeled
in ways that are socially desirable as well as in ways that are
socially destructive. Let us give testimony to our faith that the earth
is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no
victims.&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

Forgotten The Foundation?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public
need to be awakened to the central role
played by taxation. They need to see that loss of our historic land tax
has made speculation our top national sport -- a treacherous one at
that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect
Paul Spreiregen):</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
There is no doubt that the present real property tax...contributes more
to depressing the standard of housing than all government housing
policies combined do to raise it. The current property tax may fairly
be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land values too lightly,
buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use, penalizes good
land use. Consider three identical homes and lots:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec
room, new roof, great landscaping.</span> The
assessor comes by and says, in effect: "As punishment for making a
showplace, and for generating jobs and profits for local businesses,
we're raising your assessment by the amount of your investments. Your
tax bill will go up, not just for a year, but for as long as you keep
the house in good condition."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his
house of the same size run down -- loose
banisters, torn screens, broken gutters, junk-filled yard. </span>The
assessor
tells him, in effect: "Because you created an eyesore for your
neighbors and an unsafe dwelling for your tenants, we're reducing your
assessment and your taxes. If your place is more dilapidated next year,
we'll reduce them even more."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his
building down; the idle lot neither houses
nor employs anybody.</span> The friendly assessor tells him, in effect:
"For
completely wasting your property, and for making no use of the
infrastructure provided for this area, we'll give you the lowest
assessment and tax bill of the three."    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples
condemn not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same
perverse property tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it
any wonder cities are torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only
the half of it. The low land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees
that the annual increase in his or her land value is greater than the
tax bill. This signals the owner to do nothing, to sit back and collect
the values generated by productive neighbors and the community.</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter
the supply of available sites.</span> This raises land prices further,
seducing more speculators into the land game, hastening the flight of
residents and businesses from central cities and even small towns. This
is far from the only cause of sprawl, but one of the most potent. It
cannot be stressed too much because it is one of the least recognized
causes. <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What avails the trade-off, to
buy land cheaper, only to
pay more over time? Median buyers are much better able to pay over time
than up front. The effect is the same as financing all buyers, and so
doing without credit discrimination as to rate of interest or other
terms of lending. It removes all forms of credit rationing as factors
in the land market, at the same time that it automatically meets the
new buyer's greatest credit need, financing for the purchase of land.
It yields all those benefits not just once, but for every succeeding

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The same force that helps the

care. A land tax stings the sleeping owner who clings to lands from
inertia and lassitude, and bids him or her release them to youth and
enterprise. It legitimizes and supports property only as a means to
produce wealth, not property for the sake of property. It penalizes
pure possessiveness. It overpowers the ancient vice of self-justifying
acquisition, the auri sacra fames of Virgil, the "proputty, proputty,
proputty" lampooned so mordantly by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the Absentee

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>the US, the federal government traditionally
relied on tariffs, then selling the west, and now the income tax.
States relied on sales and now income taxes. Localities relied on
property taxation. This traditional divvying of the tax base pie is not
embedded in the constitution. During the Civil War, the federal
government enacted both a property tax and an income tax -- and could
do so again.</small></font>
<br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some state
constitutions prevent the PTS. Decades ago, speculator-led
initiatives enacted amendments to require the same rate on structures
and sites.</span> To repeal this stricture, a future amendment could be
either
a statewide mandate or local option. (The former orders and the latter
allows local jurisdictions to adopt the PTS.) Both Pennsylvania's and a
currently proposed amendment in New Jersey permit municipal, county,
and local districts to adopt differential rate property taxes,
including 100% land taxes. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>What determines one's new bottom
line is how intensely one uses land.

</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>The PTS raises the tax burden on low
intensity users of land, such as:
slum lords, car dealers, speculators sitting on unused land, mall
owners and probably their tenants, and farmers on land near a city's
limits, assessed according to potential use, and not granted
deferments.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>On the other hand, owners of homes,
condos, apartments,
neighborhood-based, pedestrian-friendly businesses, and industrial
facilities generally use land intensively. The PTS would save them
money, although only slightly for home owners, based on studies of King
and Clark Counties, WA (Gihring, 1994, 1996). 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Agricultural parcels far
removed from suburban areas, given very low value, may also come out
ahead. ... 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>What's won or lost is a value generated by
society. That is, land rises in value 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where a new resource is
discovered (<span style="font-weight: bold;">during a gold rush, more
money is made by land developers
than by prospectors</span>), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where population grows (see the Sun
Belt and
verdant Northwest), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where technology advances (witness
the land values
in the various Silicon Valleys, Forests, etc), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where infrastructure
expands (e.g., near a new road or sewer), and 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where society cooperates
(e.g., in communities that organize street fairs, neighborhood watches,
etc). 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>These factors driving land value are not
improvements made by
lone owners but by the entire community. The closest correlation to
land value is density and no one person creates that. Hence the site
value levy merely puts public values in the public treasury for public
benefit, as untaxing homes, sales, and income leaves
privately-generated values in private pockets. ...<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS
would replace
is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
owners for improving. This negative incentive does its greatest damage
at the margin, where profit is slim. There, rather than pay a higher
tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The lack of much tax
on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.</span><br>
<br>
Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land. Leap-frog
development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. The resultant
sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
<br>
The PTS reverses all these negative consequences. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than burden
construction, taxing only land spares it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread
development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it
(providing a market for mass transit). 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than inflate land price,
a land tax squashes it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of
prime sites or
itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected site rent
as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher, making home
ownership inflation-proof. ...
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>It may be possible to mollify some
potential opponents. Speculators and
holders of underused sites, particularly in high value areas, are the
most likely "losers". Efforts to educate this sector, prior to
politicizing the public, may prevent loud opposition. The lesson from
Southfield, Australia, and most two-rate cities in Pennsylvania is
that, post PTS, land values in urban areas increase. Although higher
values mean higher taxes, they also mean a higher potential profit. The
owner could put up an income-earning structure or sell out at a higher
price. <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Developers might learn to like the
PTS, since financial loss does not
necessarily follow. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>First, tho' the land tax would
preclude a huge
profit from a few sales, it would also, by unplugging effective demand
for housing, create many more sales of smaller profit. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Second, instead
of profiting from locational values, they could make more money --
untaxed -- by adding value, such as total weatherization, heat pumps,
light tubes, built-in wiring for the cyber-house, etc. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Third, to buy
land, developers would not need to go so deeply into debt. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Fourth, by
building on central sites, they could drastically reduce their systems
development charges, which, were they pegged to full costs, would be up
to $30,000 in Oregon. 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>For these four reasons, developers could
break
even.</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small><br>
Realtors, too, may remain on the sidelines. Tho' housing prices will
decline, more owners will afford the cost of entry. The volume of home
sales climbs after the PTS. ... <br>
&nbsp;<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About the
Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To pay the land
dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy

more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway

effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. <span

tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
world -- both in time and money. And all the while the land monopolist
has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
his part; and that is justice!</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Unearned increment
reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
follow the process a little further. The population of the
city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale -- that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
when the sale is finally accomplished. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
fact, you may say that the
unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
not to the service but to the disservice done. </span>... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however,
had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All across America, land
speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</span>
...
</small><br>
<br>
<small>In classical economics, the definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conflating land
into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. </span>The failure of society to
recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He recognized that many,
perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about,</span>
as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. </b>In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To some people this may be
counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>Taxing land value only is an incentive with the virtue of reversing the centrifugal
      forces of sprawl development and the tendency for builders to choose suboptimal
      locations.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Some titleholders
      find it advantageous to hold their valuable parcels off the market for speculative
      gain. But bringing the holding costs forward rather than allowing their exploitation
      for a capital gain upon sale increases the market efficiency of transactions
      and more optimal use of sites. The incentive to speculate on others' dime is
      removed. ...</p>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all. ...</p>
  <p>All this makes for a far simpler and more comprehensible system of taxation.
      Land taxes are totally transparent, impossible to evade, and therefore
    much more administrable. This further engenders the legitimacy of taxation
    and of
      government itself. What it also does is assure stability to the tax system,
      for the reason that land values are not subject to the variations and vacillations
      that other tax bases frequently have. Indeed, the removal of economic rent
      from locational sites discourages speculative bubbles and the related economic
      cycles that are associated with them. This greater stability and reliability
      is to the advantage of every sector of the economy &#8212; private, public,
      and non-profit.</p>
  <p>A tax that collects economic rent offers a win-win proposition to every
    sector of the community &#8212; except to those who speculate in land. But
    who wants to favor land speculators? They are not held in high regard anywhere;
    their
      destructive behavior is the bane of cities, recognized everywhere for what
      it is: parasitic and passive. Speculators provide no added value to a community's
      well-being, and taxing rent is a foolproof means by which to eliminate
    it. Land speculation is highest where the most rent can be privately captured,
      but it forces those who choose to develop to look to sub-optimal locations
      when the primary locations they hoped for are held off the market for opportunistic
      gain. By collecting rent, primary choice locations become available for
    use
      and to facilitate the development of land use configurations ideal for
    the economic health and efficient allocation. Urban ambience is improved,
    public
      sector service costs are reduced, and sprawl development is stemmed.</p>
  <p>In the final analysis cities have no reason to complain other than by being
      hoodwinked by an economics profession that went off track a century ago and
      has seen its own disciples unable to take off the veil.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[23]</em></strong></font> It
      was then that economic theory was altered to treat land as simply another
      form of capital, changed to formulas based on two factors of production
      rather than
      three, and disposing of the notion of economic rent altogether. Henry George,
      the last passionate defender of the classical economic tradition a century
      ago, lost his fight to preserve three-factor economics. But there are many
      still who appreciate the value, even the truth, of his insight and analysis.
      Today we have the computer power to test these ideas and to demonstrate
      their validity. There is an oft retold story among adherents of the Georgist
      school
      referred to as &quot;seeing the cat.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Bill Batt: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Batt_Georgist_Ecological_Economics.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The heart of George&#8217;s economics
was, in a way, Biblical. As the son of
a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span> eight years
later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is
that
nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
price without people. Hence rent was the community&#8217;s entitlement and
not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It was obvious to George
that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
belonging to all. </span>The earth and all its product, he argued, was
the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. </span>He witnessed
first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. </span>He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He realized that
people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. </span>It was
not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s
an honest graft, and I&#8217;m an example of how it works. I might sum up the
whole thing by sayin&#8217;: &#8220;I seen my opportunities and I took &#8216;em.&#8221;<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Just let me explain by
examples. My party&#8217;s in power in the city, and it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to undertake
a lot of public improvements. Well, I&#8217;m tipped off, say, that they&#8217;re
going to lay out a new park in a certain place.</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
<br>
I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all
the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that
makes its plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody
cared particularly for before.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Ain&#8217;t it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on
my investment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that&#8217;s honest
graft. <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">32</span></small></span><br>
