Weightman, June 26, 1826, <br>
before the celebration of the 50th anniversary <br>
of the Declaration of Independence</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the countries that many of  our ancestors fled, the laws and traditions
      called for primogeniture, the practice of the father's land being left
    to the eldest son, so as not to split it up into properties so small that
    one could not support a nuclear family from it. The daughters and
    the younger sons were left to make their own way as best they could, taking
    up
    trades.
    The
    eldest
      sons continued as landlords, with the privilege of collecting rent from
    the children of their fathers' tenants. (Do you remember the WWII movie,<em> The
    White Cliffs of Dover</em>?)</p>
  <p>Yes, we abolished primogeniture, so all one's children could inherit equally.  </p>
  <p>But today, with the increasingly skewed distribution of wealth, the children
      of a few of us are able to inherit huge sums of money, valuable pieces
      of land, rights to natural resources including energy, minerals, water
    and the airwaves, corporate
      stock and business equity, while the children of the rest
      of us inherit
      little
      or
      nothing. But we hold it to be a self-evident truth  that we are all created
      equal. What is it that we send our troops into harm's way to protect? Is
      it that we are<em> all</em> created equal, or is it the privileges that
      are accorded to
      those who own our land and natural resources, and their children? <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Whole People the True
Owners of the Land.</b>
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When, therefore, a privileged
class arrogantly claims a right of
private property in the land of a country, that claim is simply
unintelligible, except in the broad principle that the land of a
country is not a free gift at all, but solely a family inheritance;
that it is not a free gift which God has bestowed on His creatures,
but an inheritance which he has left to His children; that they,
therefore, being God's eldest sons, inherit this property by right of
succession; that the rest of the world have no share or claim to it,
on the ground that origin is tainted with the stain of illegitimacy.</span>
The world, however, will hardly submit to this shameful imputation of
its own degradation, especially when it is not sustained by even a
shadow of reason.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I infer, therefore, that no
individual or class of individuals can
hold a right of private property in the land of a country; that the
people of that country, in their public corporate capacity, are, and
always must be, the real owners of the land of their country --
holding an indisputable title to it, in the fact that they received
it as a free gift from its Creator, and as a necessary means for
preserving and enjoying the life He has bestowed upon them. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The essential and immutable
principles of justice used certainly
to be: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That everyone had a right of
property in the hard-earned fruits of
his labour; that whatever property a man had made by the expenditure
of his capital, his industry and his toil, was really his own; that
he, and he alone, had a right to all the benefits, the advantages and
enjoyments that that property yielded; and that if anyone else
meddled with that property against his will, or interfered with him
in its enjoyment, he was thereby guilty of the crimes of theft and of
robbery, which the eternal law of God, as well as the laws of all
nations, reprobated and punished with such severity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the principles which underlie
the existing system of Land
Tenure, and which impart to it its specific and distinctive
character, are exactly the reverse of these. The principles on which
that system is based are: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That one privileged class do not
require to labour for their
livelihood at all: that they have an exclusive right to all the
advantages, comforts and enjoyments that can be derived from a
splendid property, which exacted no patient, painful or self-denying
efforts of labour to create it or acquire it, and which, in fact,
they inherited without any sacrifice at all: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">that, being a singularly
favoured race, and being all God's eldest sons, the rest of the world
must humbly acknowledge themselves to be their inferiors in rank,
lineage, condition and dignity: </span>that this superiority of rank
gives
them a right to sell out God's gifts as if they were purely the
products of their own labour and industry, and that they can exact in
exchange for them famine or scarcity prices. Finally, that they enjoy
the enviable privilege of appropriating the hard-earned property of
others against their wills, and do them no wrong even if they charge
them a rent for the use of what would really appear to be their
own. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

payment can be set up by the landlords?<span style="font-weight: bold;">
No one will contend that the
land is theirs of natural right, for the day has gone by when men
could be told that the Creator of the universe intended his bounty
for the exclusive use and benefit of a privileged class of his
creatures &#8211; that he intended a few to roll in luxury while their
fellows toiled and starved for them. </span>The claim of the landlords
to
the land rests not on natural right, but merely on municipal
law &#8211; on municipal law which contravenes natural right. And,
whenever the sovereign power changes municipal law so as to conform
to natural right, what claim can they assert to compensation? Some of
them bought their lands, it is true; but they got no better title
than the seller had to give. And what are these titles? Titles based
on murder and robbery, on blood and rapine&#8211;titles which rest on
the most atrocious and wholesale crimes. Created by force and
maintained by force, they have not behind them the first shadow of
right. That Henry II and James I and Cromwell and the Long Parliament
had the power to give and grant Irish lands is true; but will any one
contend they had the right?<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Will any
one contend that in all the past
generations there has existed on the British Isles or anywhere else
any human being, or any number of human beings, who had the right to
say that in the year 1881 the great mass of Irishmen should be
compelled to pay &#8211; in many cases to residents of England, France,
or the United States &#8211; for the privilege of living in their native
country and making a living from their native soil?</span> Even if it
be
said that might makes right; even if it be contended that in the
twelfth, or seventeenth, or eighteenth century lived men who, having
the power, had therefore the right, to give away the soil of Ireland,
it cannot be contended that their right went further than their
power, or that their gifts and grants are binding on the men of the
present generation. No one can urge such a preposterous doctrine.
And, if might makes right, then the moment the people get power to
take the land the rights of the present landholders utterly cease,
and any proposal to compensate them is a proposal to do a fresh
wrong.&nbsp; ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

    they are making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and

    Section VII: Justice of the Remedy; Chapter 5: Of Property in Land in the
    United States</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In short, the American people have failed to see the essential injustice of
        private property in land, because as yet they have not felt its full effects.
        This public domain -- the vast extent of land yet to be reduced to private
        possession, the enormous common to which the faces of the energetic were
      always turned, has been the great fact that, since the days when the first
      settlements
        began to fringe the Atlantic Coast, has formed our national character and
      colored our national thought.<strong> It is not that we have eschewed a titled
      aristocracy and abolished primogeniture; that we elect all our officers from
      school director
        up to president; that our laws run in the name of the people, instead of
      in
        the name of a prince; that the State knows no religion, and our judges wear
        no wigs -- that we have been exempted from the ills that Fourth of July orators
        used to point to as characteristic of the effete despotisms of the Old World. <em>The
        general intelligence, the general comfort, the active invention, the power
        of adaptation and assimilation, the free, independent spirit, the energy
      and
        hopefulness that have marked our people, are not causes, but results -- they
        have sprung from unfenced land.</em></strong> This public domain has
        been the transmuting force which has turned the thriftless, unambitious
        European peasant into
      the self-reliant Western farmer; it has given a consciousness of freedom
        even to
        the dweller in crowded cities, and has been a wellspring of hope even
        to those who have never thought of taking refuge upon it. The child of
        the people,
      as
        he grows to manhood in Europe, finds all the best seats at the banquet
        of life marked &quot;taken,&quot; and must struggle with his fellows
        for the crumbs that fall, without one chance in a thousand of forcing
        or sneaking his way
        to a seat. In America, whatever his condition, there has always been
        the consciousness that the public domain lay behind him; and the knowledge
        of this
      fact, acting
        and reacting, has penetrated our whole national life, giving to it generosity
        and independence, elasticity and ambition. <strong>All that we are proud of in the
        American character; all that makes our conditions and institutions better
      than those of older countries, we may trace to the fact that land has been
      cheap
        in the United States, because new soil has been open to the emigrant.</strong></p>
  <p>But our advance has reached the Pacific. Further west we cannot go, and
    increasing population can but expand north and south and fill up what has
    been passed
        over. North, it is already filling up the valley of the Red River, pressing
        into that of the Saskatchewan and pre-empting Washington Territory; south,
        it is covering western Texas and taking up the arable valleys of New
    Mexico and Arizona.</p>
  <p>The republic has entered upon a new era, an era in which the monopoly
      of the land will tell with accelerating effect. The great fact which has
    been so potent is ceasing to be. The public domain is almost gone -- a very
    few
      years will end its influence, already rapidly failing. I do not mean to
    say that there will be no public domain. For a long time to come there will
    be
      millions of acres of public lands carried on the books of the Land Department.
      But it must be remembered that the best part of the continent for agricultural
      purposes is already overrun, and that it is the poorest land that is left.
      It must be remembered that what remains comprises the great mountain ranges,
      the sterile deserts, the high plains fit only for grazing. And it must
    be remembered that much of this land which figures in the reports as open
    to settlement is
      unsurveyed land, which has been appropriated by possessory claims or locations
      which do not appear until the land is returned as surveyed. California
    figures on the books of the Land Department as the greatest land state of
    the Union,
      containing nearly 100,000,000 acres of public land -- something like one-twelfth
      of the whole public domain. Yet so much of this is covered by railroad
    grants or held in the way of which I have spoken; so much consists of untillable
    mountains
      or plains which require irrigation; so much is monopolized by locations
    which command the water, that as a matter of fact it is difficult to point
    the immigrant
      to any part of the state where he can take up a farm on which he can settle
      and maintain a family, and so men, weary of the quest, end by buying land
    or renting it on shares. It is not that there is any real scarcity of land
    in
      California -- for, an empire in herself, California will some day maintain
      a population as large as that of France -- but appropriation has got ahead
      of the settler and manages to keep just ahead of him. ... <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp075.html">read the whole chapter</a></p>

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? <strong>Is it not likewise a plain
    warning that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive
    power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners?</strong> Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>

    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend. ... </p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
      not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take
      the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
  <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
    indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
    want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
    of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
    you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
    of land.</p>
  <p>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from nature,
    not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership with possession
    and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
    property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any
    other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
    in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
    to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that
    it came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
    man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively
    to him or to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property,
    which originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
    of the thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
    so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice
    to the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
    They do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is
    but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
    labor.</p>
  <p><strong>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any
      grant from the Maker of land? </strong>What does nature give to such ownership? how does she
    in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
    of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
    their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and
    another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from
    man and passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression
    of his labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the
    individual; but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed
    before man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men
    come and go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man
    for &#8220;the daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?</p>
  <p>      Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from nature.
      Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of morals when it
      is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as
        it is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice
      on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
      of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
  <p><strong>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value
      of landownership for the use of the community, the real injustice is in
      leaving it in private
    hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</strong></p>
  <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
    for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
    God intended it to take &#8212; <strong>before men who have been disinherited
    of their natural rights can be restored to them</strong>, the present owners of land
    shall first be compensated.</p>
  <p>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and largely
    benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists are
    much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though the great
    landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general among whom the
    profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges,
    etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers in
    the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly, more strongly,
    more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or losses would your
    duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you to listen for one moment
    to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
  <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that those
    whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners would
    be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
    alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim
    to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the
    same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest
    of what they before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice
    are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that l<strong>and
    is really the storehouse that God owes to all his children</strong>, you will no more
    listen to any demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses
    would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before
    letting the children of Israel go.</p>
  <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
    of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
    We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
    We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to
    bury their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of
    land values have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus
    got. <strong>We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor
    shall cease &#8212; that
    for the future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community
    the rent that to the community is justly due. ...</strong></p>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
    <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
      than their share of labor on others.</li>
    <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
      as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
      their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same
      right of excluding their fellows.</li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that
        all men are children of God the common Father; that all have the same
        last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the
      unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet in all
      this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
      of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
      and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
      give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
    made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
    gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
    that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
    Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
    priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
    of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
    grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Do you question the relationship
between taxation and righteousness?
Let us see. If government is a natural growth, then surely God's
natural law provides food and sustenance for government as that food is
needed; for where in Nature do we find a creature coming into the world
without timely provision of natural food for it? It is in our system of
taxation that we find the most emphatic denial of the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of Man, because, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>first, in order to meet our common
needs, we take from individuals what does not belong to us in common; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>second, we permit individuals to take for themselves what
does belong
to us in common; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>thus, third, under the pretext of taxation for public
purposes, we have established a system that permits some men to tax
other men for private profit.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Does not that violate the
  natural, the divine law? Does it not surely
  beget wolfish greed on the one hand, and gaunt poverty on the other?
  Does it not surely breed millionaires on one end of the social scale
  and tramps on the other end? Has it not brought into civilization a
  hell, of which the savage can have no conception? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Could any better
  system be devised for convincing men that God is the father of a few
  and the stepfather of the many?</span> Is not that destructive of the
  sentiment of brotherhood? With such a condition, how is it possible for
  men in masses to obey the new commandment, "that ye love one another"?
  What could more surely thrust men apart? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What could more surely divide
  them into warring classes?&nbsp; ...</span></small></p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</p>
  <p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
    of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
    on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
    in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
    living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
    in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
    and one of the inferior animals? Our American apologists for slavery used
    to contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated the
    intent of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference
    that you assume to be natural is between men of the same race. <strong>What
    difference does nature show between such men as would indicate her intent
    that one should
    live idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor?</strong> If I could
    bring you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and one who
    is glad to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by side in
    your antechamber, would you be able to tell which was which, even were you
    to call in the most skilled anatomist? Is it not clear that God in no way
    countenances or condones the division of rich and poor that exists today,
    or in any way permits it, except as having given them free will he permits
    men to choose either good or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer hell.
    <strong>For is it not clear that the division of men into the classes rich
    and poor has invariably its origin in force and fraud; invariably involves
    violation
    of the moral law; and is really a division into those who get the profits
    of robbery and those who are robbed; those who hold in exclusive possession
    what God made for all, and those who are deprived of his bounty? </strong>Did not
    Christ in all his utterances and parables show that the gross difference
    between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s law? Would he have condemned
    the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction between rich and
    poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s intent?</p>
