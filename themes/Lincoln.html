<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>John Lincoln</strong></span><strong> and
  the Lincoln Land Institute</strong></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>John Lincoln (1866-1959) was one of a number of   highly successful industrialists
    (on this website, see also: <a href="../docs/Fels.html">Fels</a>) who devoted
    himself to promoting Georgist ideas during his lifetime.
    In 1946,
    he endowed
    the Lincoln Foundation, <strong><em>to teach and expound the ideas of Henry
    George as expressed in <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,</em></strong><em>    </em>apparently
    using language identical to that used by Robert Schalkenbach twenty years
    earlier in endowing his foundation.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it appears that his heirs and the foundation's trustees have
    other values and priorities.&nbsp; Many Georgists deeply regret
    the directions his heirs have
    taken that foundation.&nbsp; While the Lincoln Land Institute  acknowledges
    Henry George ceremonially (and has published a two-CD set of George's writings),
    otherwise little priority is given to the social, economic and <em><strong>justice</strong></em> issues
    Henry George spoke to &#8212; or
    the <a href="The_Remedy.html">remedy</a>    he called for &#8212; and his
    message is, at best, highly diluted in the foundation's activities and spending.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
    visitor to the Lincoln Land Institute comes away with an impression that
    most people there regard
    George as the crazy
    uncle in their attic, rather than as one of the great modern prophets and
    seers and social reformers, whose ideas they are employed to promote, and
    that few have read widely or deeply or thoughtfully in Henry George's writings
    or in the writings of contemporary Georgists, nor given much thought to issues
    of social and economic justice. Rather, they seem to seek to support the
    status quo.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, there are signs that at least part of the Lincoln family
    is familiar with Georgist ideas; they sponsored a week-long session at
    the Chautauqua Institution in August 2005, which included a speech by <a href="../auth/Davies.html">Lindy
    Davies</a> (<a href="../docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">Land
    and Justice</a>, among the Essential Documents on this website) and another
    by
    <a href="../auth/Hartzok.html">Alanna Hartzok</a>. Wealthandwant hopes that
    they will shift the primary direction of the well-funded Lincoln Land
    Institute toward  the important work John Lincoln clearly intended it
    to do. <em><strong>They could make a tremendous contribution to social and
    economic justice in America &#8212; and to peace in the world.</strong></em></p>

  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider that there was a
single-tax party, the Commonwealth land
Party. In 1924 its Presidential candidate was
William J. Wallace of New Jersey, with John C. Lincoln, brilliant
Cleveland industrialist, for Vice-president (Moley, p.162).&nbsp; In
1919 Georgists began working through the Manufacturers and
Merchants Federal Tax League to sponsor a <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">federal </span>land
tax, the
Ralston-Nolan Bill. Drafted by Judge Jackson H. Ralston, it would
impose a "1% excise tax on the privilege of holding lands, natural
resources and public franchises valued at more than $10,000, after
deducting all improvements" (Jorgensen, pp.8-9).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small> In
1924 Congressman
Oscar E. Keller of Minnesota reintroduced it (H.R. 5733). In spite of
Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, Progressivism still lived in Congress.
In 1923, for the first and last time, income tax returns were made
public, giving valuable data-ammunition to land taxers. Progressivism
also lived in Wisconsin, where Professor John R. Commons in 1921
drafted the Grimstad Bill to focus the property tax on bare land
values (Commons, 1922). Commons believed that 95% of "millionaire
fortunes" consisted of land and franchise values (1903, p.253). Young
State Assemblyman (later Professor) Harold Groves was among its
supporters....&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

    my readers find out if what you're saying is really true? Name the most widely
    used economics textbooks in American universities right now and what they
    teach that is an obvious lie for the benefit of landed interests.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - I no longer use textbooks
    much, but there are dozens available for the more common courses. Some are
    less bad than others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Strategies change over time. It is no longer
    common to attack George virulently, as was done in the period that my book
    covers, 1880-1930 or so. Today Georgism has receded as a political force,
    so modern strategies are less frantic and overt. Today, they trivialize,
    misrepresent, and brush off lightly.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Paul Samuelson, Robert
    Solow, Peter Mieszkowski, Theodore Schultz, and Edwin Mills, for example,
    casually pronounce that land rent is only 5% or so of total income, so a
    single land tax could not support government as we know it. They offer no
    support for this except to echo each other, and to cite some transparently
    irrelevant data from the US Dept. of Commerce. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They
    are, tragically, encouraged in this stratagem by work subsidized and influenced
    by the Lincoln Foundation, an outfit originally funded to promote the ideas
    of Henry George, but soon coopted and diverted from its chartered purposes.</span> They
    simply ignore the few careful studies of the matter, as by <a href="../auth/Hudson.html">Michael
    Hudson</a>,
    Allen Manvel, myself, and Steven Cord, that show much higher figures.&nbsp; </small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Conspiracy.html"><small>Read

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Sapiro.html">In Memoriam,
Stan
Sapiro</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As his last hurrah, Stanley sued the powerful
    Lincoln Foundation to make it carry out John C. Lincoln's will to propagate
    the ideas of Henry George as expressed in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. Stan researched
    the case prodigiously, as was his wont, but by now his physical powers were
    waning and he had to turn the case over to others. It was an uphill battle
    fought on the defendant's home turf of Arizona; it finally stalled on a technicality.
    Through it all, however, Stan maintained friendly rapport with David Lincoln
    himself, just as he had earlier with Ronald Reagan. There was mutual respect
    there, and it is still to be hoped that Stan's earnest endeavors may have
    touched David's conscience. </small><br>

<p>Weld Carter, correspondence, August 25, 1984</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It was a sad day for the Georgist movement when the Lincoln Foundation assumed
      the management of TRED conferences. Arlo Woolery is an extremely able administrator.
      But he is an assessor &#8212; not a Georgist. My crude estimate is that
      at least 90% of Lincoln funds are being channeled to improving assessment
      techniques,
      instead of ridding our socio-economic order of the evils of taxing buildings.
      . . . All that thunder you think you have been hearing has been old John
    C. turning over in his grave.&quot;<br>
