All Taxes Come Out of Rents</span><br>
</div>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>IT may seem like a truism to assert that the only fund upon which taxation
    can draw is that made up by the produce of the community, and that to multiply
    the places at which it is tapped is not to increase its capacity to yield.
    Yet the manner in which taxation, under our system, is spread over a multitude
    of subjects, and new subjects are still sought for, suggests the belief of
    that chief of the eunuchs who thought the weight of an obnoxious poll-tax
    might be lessened, and his master's revenues at the same time increased,
    by substituting for the tax on heads a tax upon fingers and toes.</p>
  <p> But it is probable that the disposition to tax everything susceptible of
    taxation does not spring so much from the notion that more may thus be obtained,
    as from the notion that as a matter of justice everything should be taxed.
    That all species of property shall be equally taxed, is enjoined by many
    of our State constitutions, and that it should be so, at least so far as
    direct taxation is concerned, is regarded by most of our people as a self-evident
    truth &#8212; the idea being that every one should contribute to public expenses
    in proportion to his means, or, as it is sometimes phrased, that all property,
    being equally protected by the State, should equally contribute to the expenses
    of the State. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Raising taxable rents by
untaxing capital and labor, production and exchange: the concept of
ATCOR (All Taxes Come Out of Rents)&nbsp; </span>The meaning and
relevance of ATCOR is
that when we lower other taxes, the revenue base is not lost, but
shifted to land rents and values, which can then yield more taxes. This
is most obvious with taxes on buildings. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When we exempt buildings, and
raise tax rates on the land under them, we are still taxing the same
real estate; we are just taxing it in a different way. This &#8220;different
way&#8221; actually raises the revenue capacity of real estate by a large
factor, by relieving it of the excess burden of taxing production and
capital. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is that &#8220;free lunch&#8221;
that Chicago economists wrongly preach &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such thing as.&#8221;</span></span></small><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>Historical experience with
exempting
buildings has shown that builders offer more for land, and sellers
demand more, when the new buildings are to be untaxed. The effect on
revenue is the same as taxing prospective new buildings before they are
even built, even though the new buildings are not to be taxed at all.</small><br>
<br>
<small> Net result: the revenue capacity
of
land, when it is substituted for other tax bases, is comparable to
current revenues. Owing to efficiency effects, and renewal effects, it
may well be higher.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_StRPOL15LE.html">Read

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_3legged.html">The
    Fallacy of the "Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tax experts, especially at the
state level, ply their trade by invoking one metaphor above all others:
the three-legged stool.&nbsp; It rests on the claim that a sound and
successful tax regime for any government needs to rely on a three tax
bases: income, property and sales.&nbsp; This is repeated so often that
it passes today without much examination. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The power with
which the three-legged stool analogy has underpinned tax policy is in
fact rather disconcerting, because a close examination of its premises
shows that they are very questionable.&nbsp;</span> These benchmark
measures of a tax regime are scrutinized here in order to cast doubt on
the claims so often made on their behalf. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes on
Labor and Capital, in contrast, are always shifted.&nbsp;</span>
Studies of so-called tax incidence seldom trace the flow of tax burdens
beyond the first or second step of the shift.&nbsp; Textbooks and
research studies will note that particular burdens -- for instance, a
tax on the sale of goods -- will be partly borne by the vendor and
partly also by the consumer.&nbsp; The vendor in turn sees that tax
incorporated into the price he pays for the product at the wholesale
level; the consumer sees his burden reflected in the relative cost of
living of his tax jurisdiction -- which in turn affects the price of
his home and his wages.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
shift in taxes, as economic theory makes clear, are ultimately
converted to rent, and that rent, as capitalized in land prices, is its
final resting place.&nbsp;</span> It is a truism of classical economics
as carried through in the present day tradition of Georgist economics
that <span style="font-weight: bold;">all taxes come out of rent -- an
adage that has come to be abbreviated as ATCOR.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What this insight
means is that all taxes not first imposed on Land and collected from
the rent that rests thereon are instead passed through the economy from
one party to another until they ultimately come to rest on Land, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">thereby
increasing the price of real estate</span></span>.&nbsp; The passing
along of tax burdens not only creates distortions in economic
transactions; it also constitutes an excess burden and an inefficiency
that handicaps economic performance.&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Taxing any form of Capital makes it more expensive and
leads to
less saving and investment; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>taxing Labor, in the same way, depresses wages and
discourages
enterprise.&nbsp;    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Contemporary economists and
conventional tax theorists well recognize
that taxing Labor and Capital is detrimental to economic vitality &#8212; politicians
thrive on repeating this <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
nauseam</span>.&nbsp; Currently the Republican party candidates seem
best able to exploit resentment about the negative impact of
taxes.&nbsp; But they are not alone in failing to appreciate the nature
of tax shifting.&nbsp; What all fail to realize is that there are
notable exceptions to the rule that taxes are oppressive: any tax
imposed on an inelastic base &#8212; that is, any form of Land &#8212; constitutes
no distortion or excess burden whatsoever.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Far from
spreading the burden of distribution over a wide array of&nbsp; tax
bases, the ideal tax, then, should be imposed solely on those factors
of production that form an inelastic base, i.e., that constitute forms
of Land &#8212; whether they be locational sites, natural resources, the
spectrum, time slots, or others as they may arise in the future.&nbsp;</span>
Land, in any of its forms, is totally inelastic.&nbsp; Will Rogers in
his pithy way said it well, "Buy land.&nbsp; They ain't making any more
of the stuff."&nbsp; Mark Twain said it too.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

    </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George applied these
    inherent differences between land and products was the field of taxation.
    To determine the incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be
    taxed, products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
    from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes upon things
    of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted
    from seller to buyer, increasing as they go. ...If we impose a tax upon buildings,
    the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
    will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit
    and the tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
    from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest upon
    consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the government. Now,
    the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
    supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon...[land
    value] cannot check supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels
    the land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the
    use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On
    the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation to sell or
    let for what they can get, a tax on land values tends to increase the competition
    between owners, and thus to reduce the price of land." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span

<p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
    Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out of
    the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor products.
    Let us see. </p>
  <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
    of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor produces
    on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the most, and
    D's is the least, productive land in use in the community to which they belong.
    B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose each occupies the best
    land that was open to him when he entered into possession. Now, B, and C,
    and D have just as good a right to the use of the best land as A had. </p>
  <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality of
    opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results, all other
    things being equal except the land. </p>
  <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
    must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages
    accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that which falls to
    the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </p>
  <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what it should
    produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage of natural
    opportunity over D. </p>
  <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
    for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a well, making
    a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </p>
  <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
    fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products (though
    paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they enjoy over
    D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
  <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the best
    land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use
    he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage with the
    rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him, in proportion
    to their respective advantages, those public utilities which invariably arise
    wherever men live in communities. Of course he will in turn hold to those
    who come later the same relation that those who came earlier held to him. </p>
  <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead of land;
    all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is to produce
    little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using it himself
    nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this, for he would grab
    to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold of. Each of the others
    would do the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by, E, F and
    G would find no land left for them on which they might make a living. </p>
  <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
    the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the devil
    of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice, freedom,
    social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent, consuming
    grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime breeding,
    want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
  <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor products
    in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat on the bovine
    stupidity of the community that contributes its own land values toward its
    own enslavement! </p>
  <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
  <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
    difference. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
    <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
    <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously damnable
      difference; </li>
    <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding their
      families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would yield them
      abundance on the other. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance, and if it
    does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able to draw his robe close
    around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's none of my fault;
    I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

      Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
      Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
      </a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Arriving at the appropriate
revenue formulas is the challenge.
Recapturing land rent is likely best achieved by setting the rates at
levels that stabilize the market price of landsites in the face of
speculative pressures. Because the collection of rents fosters economic
activity in the regions of highest value, it may just be that market
prices will remain stable even with very high levies. The downward
pressure on market prices exerted by a tax is countered by the
increased incentive to improve parcel sites with the highest value.
Many economists as early as the French physiocrats have argued that
ultimately all tax revenues come from rents in any case; that it is
only a question of how much they are shifted through to other sectors
of the economy before they are collected. Professor Mason Gaffney
explains this by noting that</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small><small>After-tax interest rates
  are determined
  in world markets and the local supply of capital funds is highly
  elastic. So, local taxes on capital do not stick to capital. Even
  national taxes on capital typically fail to stick, because capital is a
  citizen of the world. Local labor supplies are also pretty elastic,
  although not so totally. Local taxes on labor, therefore, do not stick
  to labor, either. Payroll taxes drive people out of localities that
  impose them, for example. Ditto for sales taxes. Customers move, or
  shift their purchases, to where taxes are lower, or zero. Sellers
  shift, too, to the extent they bear the tax. What else is left? Just
  land, and land cannot emigrate or immigrate from the local jurisdiction.<span
