    <small>Royal libertarians are fond of confusing the classical liberal concept
    of common land ownership, particularly as espoused by land value tax advocate
    Henry George, with socialism. Yet socialists have always been contemptuous
    of George and of the distinction between land monopoly and capital monopolies.

monkey-wrench which is caught in the

is called "ripening"for the
unearned increment of its owner, the merchant going to his office and

the taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place, and all the while the land monopolist has only to sit still and
watch complacently his property multiplying in value, sometimes many
fold, without either effort or contribution on his part.</i> </small>
  <p><small><i>This evil process strikes at every form of industrial
activity.
The municipality, wishing for broader streets, better houses, more
healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay more to
get them in proportion as it has exerted itself to make past
improvements. The more it has improved the town, the more it will have
to pay for any land it may now wish to acquire for further improvements.</i></small></p>

  <p><small><i>The manufacturer proposing to start a new industry,
proposing

put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some

  <p><em>Progress and Poverty</em> is the first and only thorough, complete,
    scientific inquiry ever made into the fundamental cause of industrial depressions
    and
      involuntary poverty. The ablest minds of the century attacked and condemned
      it &#8212; Professor Huxley, the Duke of Argyll, Goldwin Smith, Leo XIII,
      Frederic Harrison, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain. Nevertheless, in a
      preface to the
      definitive edition, George said what very few authors of a technical work
      have ever been able to say, that he had not met with a single criticism
      or objection
      that was not fully anticipated and answered in the book itself. For years

      to be the best friends that the capitalist ever had. Standing staunchly for

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217;</p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. The role of land
    in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic growth
    was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo
    and Malthus. But the intervening years have seen land slide into a more peripheral
    status within economic analysis. Political economists working in the Marxian
    tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as
    the key to understanding the capitalist economy. Neo-classical economists
    typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of
    production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists
    have also given little attention to land because typically their analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.<br>
    <br>
    However, there is an alternative current of political economic thought for
      which &#8216;the land question&#8217; is central. This is the tradition
      based on the ideas of Henry George. This article seeks a balanced assessment
      of the usefulness of George&#8217;s ideas in the modern context. It outlines
      how insights derived from Georgist thinking can help in dealing with contemporary
      economic, social and environmental problems, while noting deficiencies
      and additional concerns. Following a general summary of Georgist ideas
      and policy proposals, six themes are addressed:</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> the moral issue,</li>
      <li> wealth inequality,</li>
      <li> housing affordability,</li>
      <li> environmental concerns,</li>
      <li> urban development and</li>
      <li> economic cycles.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>In each case it is argued that Georgist insights provide a valuable but
        incomplete basis for analysis and policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Economic Cycles</strong></p>
      <p>Georgists have also frequently claimed to be able to explain and ameliorate,
          even resolve, the cyclical character of the capitalist economy. George
        argued that a higher uniform land tax could reduce the severity of booms
        and busts
          in the housing market by reducing the speculative investment in land.
        This would produce more stable economic conditions throughout the economy,
        removing
          the boom-bust cycle to which capitalism is otherwise prone. It is an
        argument that has contemporary Australian relevance because the boom-bust
        character
          of the urban property market is clearly a significant factor in overall
        cyclical economic instability. An earlier article on Australian land
        price trends
          by Kavanagh (2001) has illustrated this connection, demonstrating that,
        while the property market is more volatile than the economy as a whole,
        there has
          been a clear temporal connection between the two patterns of cyclical
        behaviour over the last half century. Property booms and busts have typically
        coincided
          with swings in overall national economic performance. The policy implication
          is that, by smoothing out cycles in the housing market, a uniform land
        tax could help to avoid periodic crises in capitalist economies more
        generally. ...</p>

        periodic crises in capitalist economies more generally.</p>
      <p>However, the argument needs to be kept in perspective. Periodic economic
        recessions cannot be solely attributed to speculation in land.</p>
      <p>Inadequate levels of aggregate demand, problems of overproduction, and
        problems of instability in financial markets are among other causes of
        interruptions to the process of capital accumulation. Land tax cannot
        feasibly claim to redress all the systemic contradictions and malfunctions
        of a capitalist economy. Additional counter-cyclical policies are necessary.
        These include macroeconomic stabilisers, such as monetary and fiscal
        policies, that can contribute to reducing the cyclical tendency to which
        the economy is otherwise prone, along with incomes policy and the more
        radically interventionist &#8216;socialisation of investment&#8217; that
        Keynes (1936: 378) advocated. So here, too, land tax seems to have the
        status of a necessary but not sufficient condition for progressive economic
        reform. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In retrospect, I realized the question I&#8217;d been asking since early
    adulthood was: Is capitalism a brilliant solution to the problem of scarcity,
    or is it itself modernity&#8217;s central problem? The question has many
    layers, but explorations of each layer led me to the same verdict. Although
    capitalism started as a brilliant solution, it has become the central problem
    of our day. It was right for its time, but times have changed.</p>
  <p>When capitalism started, nature was abundant and capital was scarce; it
    thus made sense to reward capital above all else. Today we&#8217;re awash
    in capital and literally running out of nature. We&#8217;re also losing many
    social arrangements that bind us together as communities and enrich our lives
    in nonmonetary ways. This doesn&#8217;t mean capitalism is doomed or useless,
    but it does mean we have to modify it. We have to adapt it to the twenty-first
    century rather than the eighteenth. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we imagine, design, and install an upgraded operating system that fixes
    these flaws? This may seem a far-fetched dream. But consider that something
    comparable happened before, in 1935, with the enactment of Social Security.</p>
  <p>Like the changes I&#8217;m suggesting here, Social Security is an intergenerational
    compact, engraved into our economic operating system. It was imagined, designed,
    and installed early in the twentieth century in response to what was then
    a looming crisis: the impoverishment of millions too old to work. The basic
    contract was, and remains, simple: active workers collectively support retired
    workers, and in return are supported in old age by the next generation of
    workers. For seventy years, this contract has been administered without scandal
    or waste by a trust fund that has never missed a payment. Thanks to this
    operating system upgrade, extreme old-age poverty, once rampant, is largely
    a thing of the past.</p>
  <p>What we need now is a comparable system upgrade, this time to fix capitalism&#8217;s
    disregard for nature, future generations, and the nonelderly poor. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we consider how to upgrade our economic operating system, it&#8217;s
    worth contemplating how it came to be. Two parallel threads emerge: the decline
    of the commons and the ascent of private corporations. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Why isn&#8217;t economic growth making us happier?</strong> There
      are many possibilities, and they&#8217;re additive rather than exclusive.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> One is that, once material needs are met, happiness is based
        on comparative rather than absolute conditions. </strong>If your neighbors
        have bigger houses than you do, the fact that yours is smaller diminishes
        your happiness, even though your house by itself meets your needs. In
        the same way, more income wouldn&#8217;t make you happier if other people
        got even more. That&#8217;s why an affluent country can get richer without
        its citizens getting happier.</li>
    <li> <strong>A second reason is that surplus capitalism foments anxiety. </strong>Millions
      live one paycheck, or one illness, away from disaster. When disaster strikes,
      the safety nets beneath them are thin. And everyone sees jobs vanishing
      as capital scours the planet for cheap labor.</li>
    <li><strong> Another reason is that surplus capitalism speeds up life and
        creates great stress.</strong> Humans didn&#8217;t evolve to multitask,
        sit in traffic jams, or work, shop, and pay bills 24/7. We need rest,
        relaxation, and time for companionship and creativity. Surplus capitalism
        can&#8217;t give us enough of those things.</li>
    <li><strong> Similarly, its nonstop marketing message &#8212; you&#8217;re
        no good without Brand X &#8212; breeds the opposites of gratitude and
        contentment, two widely acknowledged precursors of happiness.</strong> According
        to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the average American encounters
        about three thousand such messages each day. No wonder we experience
        envy, greed, and dissatisfaction. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>The perennially popular board game Monopoly is a reasonable simulacrum of
    capitalism. At the beginning of the game, players move around a commons and
    try to privatize as much as they can. The player who privatizes the most
    invariably wins.</p>
  <p>But Monopoly has two features currently lacking in American capitalism:
    all players start with the same amount of capital, and all receive $200 each
    time they circle the board. Absent these features, the game would lack fairness
    and excitement, and few would choose to play it.</p>
  <p>Imagine, for example, a twenty-player version of Monopoly in which one player
    starts with half the property. The player with half the property would win
    almost every time, and other players would fold almost immediately. Yet that,
    in a nutshell, is U.S. capitalism today: the top 5 percent of the population
    owns more property than the remaining 95 percent.</p>
  <p>Now imagine, if you will, a set of rules for capitalism closer to the actual
    rules of Monopoly. In this version, every player receives, not an equal amount
    of start-up capital, but enough to choose among several decent careers. Every
    player also receives dividends once a year, and simple, affordable health
    insurance. This version of capitalism produces more happiness for more people
    than our current version, without ruining the game in any way. Indeed, by
    reducing lopsided starting conditions and relieving employers of health insurance
    costs, it makes our economy more competitive and productive.</p>
  <p>If you doubt the preceding proposition, consider the economic operating
    systems of professional baseball, football, and basketball. Each league shifts
    money from the richest teams to the poorest, and gives losing teams first
    crack at new players. Even George Will, the conservative columnist, sees
    the logic in this: &#8220;The aim is not to guarantee teams equal revenues,
    but revenues sufficient to give each team periodic chances of winning if
    each uses its revenues intelligently.&#8221; Absent such revenue sharing,
    Will explains, teams in twenty of the thirty major-league cities would have
    no chance of winning, fans would drift away, and even the wealthy teams would
    suffer. Too much inequality, in other words, is bad for everyone. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
