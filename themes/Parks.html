  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parks</span><br>
  </div>
  <p>Somewhere I read that 14% of New York City's acreage is in parks. Parks
    generally add
    value
    to neighboring properties. (Who wouldn't like to live near a garden area
    someone else pays to maintain?)&nbsp;&nbsp; The value added to a particular
    property by the presence of a park declines with the distance it is from
    the park, just as it does with any amenity (waterfront, subway entrances,
    bus stops, grocery stores, fire protection, schools, highway access).&nbsp; Since
    the individual landholder didn't create the waterfront, nor the subway, nor
    the
    park, should he be entitled to pocket the gains due to his proximity to them?
    Should people be paying for parks through sales taxes? Income taxes? Taxes
    on buildings? Or does it make more sense to pay for parks and other things
    which disproportionately affect the value of certain sites through a tax
    collected on the value of each site?&nbsp; This argument is equally relevant
    whether the park we're talking about is Central Park or Grand Canyon National
    Park.&nbsp; Each affects land values in its vicinity. Should those benefits
    be private ones, or shared by the public?</p>

 href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
  of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
  Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
  Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">  </a></b></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>III. Applications
to Congestion</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The logic of efficient
environmental protection applies with few
changes to issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple
example of the application of land value taxation to solving a
problem of congestion. If there is a shortage of parking places (at a
zero price) then the introduction of parking meters (charging rent
for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the price of
a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and
demand at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking
only where the revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the
value of the additional lane in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few
years we will have parking meters with prices that vary by time of
day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime, we get by
with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the day
when demand is greatest.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charging rent for parking is only
a small step from charging rent
for cars that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on
the streets, the slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having
one more car on the streets is the value of the extra travel time
that everyone else endures because of the one additional car. In many
places, the congestion cost of traffic is less than the cost of
administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not the case
everywhere. <b>William Vickrey</b> used to say that his estimate of
the cost in additional delays of having one more car in midtown
Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour. He
would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be
charged $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan.
He had estimated marginal cost at the present level of usage. The
efficient charge -- perhaps $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the
streets so greatly that the marginal congestion cost of street usage
would equal the price. Efficient congestion prices for using the
streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities) would not
merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special
charges for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal
way that created congestion. If we could keep track of the movements
of vehicles, then for any vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up
vehicles that wanted to move, there would be a charge for the
resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high. Companies
making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the
day. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Congestion charges also apply
to bottlenecks such as bridges
and tunnels.</b> Whenever such a facility has cars backed up seeking
to use it, efficiency is improved by applying a toll that reduces
demand to capacity. The same output is produced, revenue is
generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The efficiency of congestion
pricing would also apply to such
public facilities as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to
have more take-offs and landings than an airport can accommodate, it
is efficient and just to allocate take-off and landing slots by
price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest of airlines, has
prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead to
allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Central Park in New York, there
are fewer baseball fields than
are demanded at a zero price. There is a private company that has the
right and responsibility to organize the leagues that are allowed to
use the fields. This company is able to charge fees that implicitly
include the scarcity value of the fields. A recognition that the
parks are the common heritage of everyone in the city would lead
instead to a charge for using the ball fields that equated supply and
demand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are also applications of
congestion prices at an
international level. For example, <b>there may be congestion in
geosynchronous orbits for satellites</b>. If this should occur, then
the just thing to do is to charge market-clearing rents for
geo-synchronous orbits and share the proceeds among all nations in
proportion to their populations. <b>... </b><span

Fred Foldvary: <a
 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent:
A Plea to Public Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public goods are usually defined
as both nonrival and nonexcludable. The public finance literature often
alleges &#8220;market failure&#8221; for goods such as streets, sewers, parks,
security, and fire fighting. Once a collective good is provided, it is
not practical or desirable to exclude persons. For example, even if one
agrees that people can be excluded from a city park, it would not be
desirable to have walls and gates to keep out the free riders.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The &#8220;free rider&#8221; doctrine, however, tends to treat public goods
as though they have no location in space and time. Somewhere, out in
the ether, there is a public good and some users who cannot be made to
pay for benefits. But the benefits of most real-world public goods fall
within an ambit that is territorial. Accordingly, those benefits become
capitalized into the market price of land within that ambit. Those
using the civic services are included by proximity; it is costly for
far-away users to visit a neighborhood park. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Residents, businesses, and customers
willingly pay more because they benefit from the territorial goods.
Most users therefore do make payments that are proportional to such
amenities, since they must pay to use land. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the payments are made to the
landowner.</span> </span>The market-failure doctrine for public goods
is turned on its head: Users do tend to pay in an indirect sense, and
government policy creates the free riding of the landowners, at the
expense of the extraneous taxpayers. Rather than correcting any
deficiency of markets, policy is iatrogenic, that is, illness caused by
the doctor. Streets, parks, and security suffer from free riding
because the doctor made it that way. This insight is rarely found in
mainstream sources. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<br>
<small>The value of a city park diminishes
with the distance from the park. Therefore, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ceteris paribus</span>, those closest to
the park will have a higher geo-rent. The most efficient way to finance
the community is from the geo-rent, not by equal dues payments. The
Tiebout model will reflect the territorial ambit of goods only when
land and location are taken into account.</small><span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS
improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a
