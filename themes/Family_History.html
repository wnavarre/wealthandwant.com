History
</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most of us took US History and World History courses in high school and
    perhaps college. But in recent years, many have undertaken a personal study
    of history
    from the point of view of researching our families' roots. In its early stages,
    it may be simply a  matter of names, dates and places, but many people then
    seek to go further, learning as much as they can about the circumstances of
    their
    ancestors'
    lives in each time and place. </p>
  <p>Some of what we find out  meshes neatly with history as we
        learned it from textbooks, but often, we find that the reality for our
    own ancestors
        was
        glossed
        over
        in what we learned. What caused our immigrant ancestors to leave their
    fatherlands to come to a new country? What were the particular circumstances?
    For example,
      if part of our family came from Ireland, we may attribute their immigration
      to  &quot;potato blight&quot; &#8212; but the story is very different and
      more complex. And it almost always has to do with <a href="Rent.html">rent </a>and
      with access to <a href="Land.html">land</a>. And then we might think about
      what they found when they got here, and how far west they had to go to
      find land they could afford.</p>
  <p>Your great great grandparents probably knew Henry George's ideas. His first
    book, <strong><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty: <em>An inquiry</em> into the cause of
    industrial depressions and the increase of want with increase of wealth ... <em>The
    Remedy</em></a><em>, </em></strong>was the #2 best seller in the years after it was published
    in 1880, second only to the Bible.  <em>P&amp;P</em>    was translated into dozens of languages and serialized in newspapers. It
    inspired
    people,
    and
    was an
    important
    influence
    in the
    Progressive
    Movement.
    Henry George (b.1879, Philadelphia - d.1897, New York City) wrote 7 more
    books after <em>P&amp;P</em>, wrote <a href="../HG/Articles.html">articles</a> for
    widely read publications and was a stirring <a href="../HG/Speeches.html">speaker</a> and <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">debater</a>,    lecturing
    in the U.K. and Australia as well as the U.S.. Twice he ran for mayor of
    New York City, and when he died during his second election campaign, the
    turnout for
    his
    funeral
    was
    said
    to be
    100,000
    people.
    He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn. His granddaughter, the choreographer
    Agnes George DeMille, wrote a <a href="../HG/PP/demille_hg_bio.html">biographical
    piece</a> which appears on this website. George was said to be among the
    three most famous people of his era, along with Thomas Edison and <a href="../docs/Twain_archimedes.html">Mark
    Twain</a>.</p>
  <p>George wrote <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The Irish Land Question</a> shortly
    after <em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em>, and later it was republished as simply &quot;<em>The
    Land Question</em>.&quot; His point was that while it was easier to <em><strong>see</strong></em> &quot;the
    land question&quot; in the case of Ireland, it was really a far more universal
    phenomenon, not
    limited to that place and time. So wherever your ancestors came
    from, however they got here &#8212; and
    wherever you live now &#8212;    this is relevant for you, your children,
    your grandchildren and generations beyond! What sort of world do you want
    them to live in? What sort of society?</p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Distress and Famine</b>
</small><br>
<small>BUT it will be asked: If the land system which prevails in
Ireland
is essentially the same as that which prevails elsewhere, how is it
that it does not produce the same results elsewhere?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I answer that it does everywhere
produce the same kind of results.
As there is nothing essentially peculiar in the Irish land system, so
is there nothing essentially peculiar in Irish distress. Between the
distress in Ireland and the distress in other countries there may be
differences in degree and differences in manifestation; but that is
all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The truth is, that as there is
nothing peculiar in the Irish land
system, so is there nothing peculiar in the distress which that land
system causes. We hear a great deal of Irish emigration, of the
millions of sons and daughters of Erin who have been compelled to
leave their native soil. But have not the Scottish Highlands been all
but depopulated? Do not the English emigrate in the same way, and for
the same reasons? Do not the Germans and Italians and Scandinavians
also emigrate? Is there not a constant emigration from the Eastern
States of the Union to the Western&#8211;an emigration impelled by the
same motives as that which sets across the Atlantic? Nor am I sure
that this is not in some respects a more demoralizing emigration than
the Irish, for I do not think there is any such monstrous
disproportion of the sexes in Ireland as in Massachusetts. If French
and Belgian peasants do not emigrate as do the Irish, is it not
simply because they do not have such "long families"?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There has recently been deep and
wide-spread distress in Ireland,
and but for the contributions of charity many would have perished for
want of food. But, to say nothing of such countries as India, China,
Persia, and Syria, is it not true that within the last few years
there have been similar spasms of distress in the most highly
civilized countries &#8211; not merely in Russia and in Poland, but in
Germany and England? Yes, even in the United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Have there not been, are there not
constantly occurring, in all
these countries, times when the poorest classes are reduced to the
direst straits, and large numbers are saved from starvation only by
charity?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When there is famine among savages
it is because food enough is
not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
exported from Ireland to England, which would not have been the case
had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
flow of more abundant harvests.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I wish clearly to bring to view
this point. The Irish famine was
not a true famine arising from scarcity of food. It was what an
English writer styled the Indian famine &#8211; a "financial famine,"
arising not from scarcity of food but from the poverty of the people.
The effect of the short crops in producing distress was not so much
in raising the price of food as in cutting off the accustomed incomes
of the people. The masses of the Irish people get so little in
ordinary times that they are barely able to live, and when anything
occurs to interrupt their accustomed incomes they have nothing to
fall back on.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet is this not true of large
classes in all countries? And are
not all countries subject to just such famines as this Irish famine?
Good seasons and bad seasons are in the order of nature, just as the
day of sunshine and the day of rain, the summer's warmth and the
winter's snow. But agriculture is, on the whole, as certain as any
other pursuit, for even those industries which may be carried en
regardless of weather are subject to alternations as marked as those
to which agriculture is liable. There are good seasons and bad
seasons even in fishing and hunting, while the alternations are very
marked in mining and in manufacturing. In fact, the more highly
differentiated branches of industry which advancing civilization
tends to develop, though less directly dependent upon rain and
sunshine, heat and cold, seem increasingly subject to alternations
more frequent and intense. Though in a country of more diversified
industry the failure of a crop or two could not have such wide-spread
effects as in Ireland, yet the countries of more complex industries
are liable to a greater variety of disasters. A war on another
continent produces famine in Lancashire; Parisian milliners decree a
change of fashion, and Coventry operatives are saved from starvation
only by public alms; a railroad combination decides to raise the
price of coal, and Pennsylvania miners find their earnings diminished
by half or totally cut off; a bank breaks in New York, and in all the
large American cities soup-houses must be opened!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this Irish famine which
provoked the land agitation, there is
nothing that is peculiar. Such famines on a smaller or a larger scale
are constantly occurring. Nay, more! the fact is, that famine, just
such famine as this Irish famine, constantly exists in the richest
and most highly civilized lands. It persists even in "good times"
'when trade is "booming;" it spreads and rages whenever from any
cause industrial depression comes. It is kept under, or at least kept
from showing its worst phases, by poor-rates and almshouses, by
private benevolence and by vast organized charities, but it still
exists, gnawing in secret when it does not openly rage. In the very
centers of civilization, where the machinery of production and
exchange is at the highest point of efficiency, where bankvaults hold
millions, and show-windows flash with more than a prince's ransom,
where elevators and warehouses are gorged with grain, and markets are
piled with all things succulent and toothsome, where the dinners of
Lucullus are eaten every day, and, if it be but cool, the very
greyhounds wear dainty blankets&#8211;in these centers in wealth and
power and refinement, there are always hungry men and women and
little children. Never the sun goes down but on human beings prowling
like wolves far food, or huddling together like vermin for shelter
and warmth. "Always with You" is the significant heading under which
a New York paper, in these most prosperous times, publishes daily the
tales of chronic famine; and in the greatest and richest city in the
world&#8211;in that very London where the plenty of meat in the
butchers' shops seemed to some savages the most wondrous of all its
wonderful sights&#8211;in that very London, the mortuary reports have
a standing column for deaths by starvation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But no more in its chronic than in
its spasmodic forms is famine
to be measured by the deaths from starvation. Perfect, indeed, in all
its parts must be the human machine if it can run till the last bit
of available tissue be drawn to feed its fires. It is under the guise
of disease to which physicians can give less shocking names, that
famine&#8211;especially the chronic famine of civilization&#8211;kills.
And the statistics of mortality, especially of infant mortality, show
that in the richest communities famine is constantly at its work.
Insufficient nourishment, inadequate warmth and clothing, and
unwholesome surroundings, constantly, in the very centers of plenty,
swell the death-rates. What is this but famine &#8211; just such famine
as the Irish famine? It is not that the needed things are really
scarce; but that those whose need is direst have not the means to get
them, and, when not relieved by charity, want kills them in its
various ways. When, in the hot midsummer, little children die like
flies in the New York tenement wards, what is that but famine? And
those barges crowded with such children that a noble and tender
charity sends down New York Harbor to catch the fresh salt breath of
the Antlantic &#8211; are they not fighting famine as truly as were our
food-laden war-ship and the Royal Prince's gunboats? Alas! to find
famine one has not to cross the sea.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There was bitter satire in the
cartoon that one of our illustrated
papers published when subscriptions to the Irish famine fund were
being made &#8211; a cartoon that represented James Gordon Bennett
sailing away for Ireland in a boat loaded down with provisions, while
a sad-eyed, hungry-looking, tattered group gazed wistfully on them
from the pier. The bite and the bitterness of it, the humiliating
sting and satire of it, were in its truth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is "the home of freedom," and
"the asylum of the oppressed;"
our population is yet sparse, our public domain yet wide; we are the
greatest of food producers, yet even here there are beggars, tramps,
paupers, men torn by anxiety for the support of their families, women
who know not which way to turn, little children growing up in such
poverty and squalor that only a miracle can keep them pure. "Always
with you," even here. What is the week or the day of the week that
our papers do not tell of man or woman who, to escape the tortures of
want, has stepped out of life unbidden? What is this but famine?&nbsp; </small><small>...<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </small></div>

praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many

are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How is labour to get the land?
How has labour got the land when it
was much further off? Irish labourers have gone some 3,000 miles
across the sea; and then in many cases 1,000 miles further west, by
saving or by borrowing some member of the family has gone across, and
their earnings have constituted an emigration fund for the rest of
the family. That great emigration has been going on all these years,
not by capital supplied by the Government, but by capital earned by
the strong arm of labour. (Applause.) The whole development of the
United States, the whole development of every new country, proves the
fallacy of this assertion that labour cannot employ itself without
capital, and proves the fallacy of the assertion, that the opening of
land to labour would do nothing to improve wages. Go into a new
country where land is free; go into a country where the price of land
is not yet high, and there, you will find no such thing as an
unemployed man; there you will find no such thing as a man begging
for employment as though it were a boon. (Hear, hear.) ... <a

in land wherever there is any prospect of advancing population or of

        a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
        Wasteland to Promised Land:
      Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>In <em>How the Other Half Dies</em>,
              Susan George wrote that "The most pressing cause of the abject poverty
              which millions of people in this world endure is that a mere 2.5% of
              landowners with more than 100 hectares control nearly three quarters of
              all the land in the world - with the top 0.23% controlling half." To
              recognize this social plague for what it is, and to avert a backlash of
              despair, requires a clear understanding of two great themes: the
          Promised Land and the Wasteland.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The Promised Land is the hope of the landless, literally, land,
              the gateway to opportunity. Abraham in Mesopotamia and the Israelites
              in bondage in Egypt so wished for their own land that they left homes
              and familiar surroundings and risked death to seek the distant place
              God had promised, a land rich in milk and honey, where a day's labor
              would put food on the table and allow their children to grow into
              adulthood. This exodus pattern has been repeated over and over, from
              the migrations of prehistory to the boat people of our day. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For centuries, immigrants have poured into
              the Americas, looking for the inheritance denied to them in the Old
          World -- their portion of land.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But the Promised Land
              is not so much a geographic place as it is a hope and a vision of a
              just social order.</span> Modern society has many wondrous features,
              but it certainly is not the Promised Land in its full glory. Indeed, we
              are "modern captives" who sense the Promised Land as a primitive
              instinct, as a deep longing, and as a cry from the depths of our
              captivity that the world should be different.&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, let us imagine, is <b>an unbounded savannah</b>, stretching off in
    unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires
    of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle
    he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
    wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely
    no choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out
    with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
    anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
    rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
    at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
    him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
    would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
    material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
    any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
    cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
    a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
    short, a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
    schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such
    things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on
    hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
    making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do
    so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger
    may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances,
    though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him
    to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy
    only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
    boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
    by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
    there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
    that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
    by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
    and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
    two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
      the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
      quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler
      under the Homestead Act. </font><br>
          <br>
  </div>
  Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
  there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
  are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
  state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
  a logrolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years.
  When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill,
  and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster,
  and the children of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching
  would have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
  send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need
  for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our
  settler can have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
  cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a
  postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the
  world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little
  church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state
  were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the intellectual
  nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power
  of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
  open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others
  to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees,
  and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered
  and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the strain,
  and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire
  and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands
  human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer
  to open up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
  times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and
  power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John
  Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
  talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the
  prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of
  fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
  and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
  circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
  sandy deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised
  Joseph from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the
  Alps with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music
  that thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
  of Kubla Khan.
    <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
      you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
      you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
      is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
      need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
      you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
      of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
      potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
      and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
      we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
      all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
      increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
      things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
      it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
      yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
      far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
      upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
      this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
      stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
      not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
      the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
      land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
      center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
      of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
      will be raised.</p>
    <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
      economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
      of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
      the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
      it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
      into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
      With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
      land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
      expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
      of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
      branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
      especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
      in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
      go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
      and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
      the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
      of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
      distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
      the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
      power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
      acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
      had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
      fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
      transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
      and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
      themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
      has given the land.</p>
    <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
      to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
      into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
      still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
      the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
      becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
      are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
      friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
      that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
      one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
      set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
      have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
      is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
      into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
      of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
      of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
      museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
      all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
      actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
      is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
    <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
      of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
      over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
      tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
      eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
      engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
      of horses. </p>
    <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
        other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
        focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
        of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
        attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
        fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
        the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
        productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
        has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another <a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip
        Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
        from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
        are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
        than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
        more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
        streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
        finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
        Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
        same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
        it had no value at all.</p>
    <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
      in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
      him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
      difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
      rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
      compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
      which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
      valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
      not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
      utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
    <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
      gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
      attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
      of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
      makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
      rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
      of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
    <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
        as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
        heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
        brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
        fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
        fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
        Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
        and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
        be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
        will have greatly increased.</p>
    <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If
      the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch
      and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. <b><i>And
      very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the
      hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!" ... <em><a href="../HG/PP/SP/03_Rent_Grows.htm">read

      Henry George: <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
      to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Scarcity of employment" is a
comparatively new complaint in the United States. In our earlier times
it was never heard of or thought of. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There
was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side of the
Atlantic the trouble -- so it was deemed by a certain class -- was
"scarcity of labor." It was because of this "scarcity of labor " that
negroes were imported from Africa and indentured apprentices from the
Old Country, that men who could not pay their passage sold their labor
for a term of years to get here, and that that great stream of
immigration from the Old World that has done so much to settle this
continent set in. </span>Now, why was there "scarcity of employment"
on one side of the Atlantic and "scarcity of labor" on the other? What
was the cause of this difference, of which all other social and
political differences were but consequences? Adam Smith saw it, and in
his "Wealth of Nations" states it, but it did not need an Adam Smith
for that, as everyone who knew anything of the two countries knew it.
It was, that in this country land was cheap and easy to get, while in
Europe land was dear and hard to get. Land has been steadily growing
dear in the United States, and as a consequence we hear no longer of
"scarcity of labor." We hear now of "scarcity of employment."</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the first quarter of this century an educated and thoughtful
Englishman, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, visited this country. He saw its
great resources, and noted the differences between the English-speaking
society growing up here and that to which he had been used. Viewing
everything from the standpoint of a class accustomed to look on the
rest of mankind as created for their benefit, 'what he deemed the great
social and economic disadvantage of the United States was "the scarcity
of labor." It was to this he traced the rudeness of even what he styled
the upper class, its want of those refinements, enjoyments, and
delicacies of life common to the aristocracy of England. How could an
English gentleman emigrate to a country where labor was so dear that he
might actually have to black his own boots; so dear that even the
capitalist might have to work, and no one could count on a constant
supply ready to accept as a boon any opportunity to perform the most
menial, degrading, and repulsive services? Mr. Wakefield was not a man
to note facts without seeking their connection. He saw that this
"scarcity of labor" came from the cheapness of land where the vast area
of the public domain was open for settlement at nominal prices. A man
of his class and time, without the slightest question that land was
made to be owned by landlords, and laborers were made to furnish a
supply of labor for the upper classes, he was yet a man of imagination.
He saw the future before the English-speaking race in building up new
nations in what were yet the waste spaces of the earth. But he wished
those new nations to be socially, politically, and economically newer
Englands; not to be settled as the United States had been, from the
"lower classes" alone, but to contain from the first a proper
proportion of the "upper classes" as well. He saw that "scarcity of
employment" would in time succeed "scarcity of labor" even in countries
like the United States by the growth of speculation in land; but he did
not want to wait for that in the newer Britains which his imagination
pictured. He proposed at once to produce such salutary "scarcity of
employment " in new colonies as would give cheap and abundant labor, by
a governmental refusal to sell public land, save at a price so high as
to prevent the poorer from getting land, thus compelling them to offer
their labor for hire.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This was the essential part of what was once well known as the
Wakefield plan of colonization. It is founded on a correct theory. In
any country, however new and vast, it would be possible to change
"scarcity of labor" into "scarcity of employment" by increasing the
price put on the use of land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If
three families settled a virgin continent, one family could command the
services of the others as laborers for hire just as fully as though
they were its chattel slaves, if it was accorded the ownership of the
land and could put its own price on its use. Wakefield proposed only
that land should be held at what he called "a sufficient price" -- that
is, a price high enough to keep wages in new colonies only a little
higher than wages in the mother-country, and to produce not actual
inability to get employment on the part of laborers, but only such
difficulty as would keep them tractable, and ready to accept what from
his standpoint were reasonable wages.</span> Yet it is evident that it
would only require a somewhat greater increase in the price of land to
go beyond this point and to bring about in the midst of abundant
natural opportunities for the employment of labor, the phenomena of
laborers vainly seeking employment. Now, in the United States we have
not attempted to create "scarcity of employment" by Wakefield's plan.
But we have made haste by sale and gift to put the public domain in the
hands of private owners, and thus allowed speculation to bring about
more quickly and effectually than he could have anticipated, more than
Wakefield aimed at. The public domain is now practically gone; land is
rising to European prices, and we are at last face to face with social
difficulties which in the youth of men of my time we were wont to
associate with "the effete monarchies of the Old World." Today, as the
last census reports show, the majority of American farmers are
rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form of tenancy;
and the great majority of our people are landless men, without right to
employ their own labor and without stake in the land they still
foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why the army of
the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has already
become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous type the
proletarian of ancient Rome.&nbsp; </small><small><a
