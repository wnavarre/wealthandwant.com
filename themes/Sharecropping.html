<p>  A.J.O. [probably Mark Twain]: <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
  estate and 100 slaves, all the land
  about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
  myself.&nbsp; ... </small></p>
  <p>    <small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
    unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
    free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.&nbsp; ... </small>    </p>
  <p><small>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
    work it for themselves, and be their own masters.&nbsp; ... </small>    </p>
  <p><small>"But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your
          proposals
          about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
          but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
          give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
    reasonable, would it?"&nbsp; ... </small>    </p>
  <p><small>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
              as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
    agree."&nbsp; ... </small>    </p>
  <p><small>So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
                old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
                whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
                from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
                of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
      themselves.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep my
men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people's expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REJOICE! I AM CAPITAL AND I
EMPLOY PEOPLE!</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whereas it is not my capital
that does any of these things.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small>But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an
overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay.&nbsp;<strong> .... </strong></small><br>
<small>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
debts.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
I that do it; it is that greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent --
and
get it. <b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
that chattel slavery is not the
only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
in the USA, the UK and Australia
understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of
privilege and power &#8212; captives of the current hegemony &#8212;
daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental question,
lest they, too, become ridiculed.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so the world continues to
wallow in this particular ignorance
&#8212; and in its ensuing poverty and debt.&nbsp; <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On this island that I have
supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
But <span style="font-weight: bold;">if one man owned the island, and
if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to
hold
land idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up
land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest
landowners could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere
that simple plan would compel the landowner either to use his land or
to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of land would then
fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege it
gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be
used for the benefit of the whole community. <a

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: In Globalization and its Discontents, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Weight of
excess burden of most taxes.</b> Many modern Georgists tend, oddly,
to trivialize the power of tax bias to keep land from its best use.
They have seized upon a conventional micro-economic device, now
generally called the &#8220;Harberger Triangle,&#8221; in recognition
of one Chicago-School expositor. It is based on supply and demand
curves, with no reference to land markets at all. Perhaps these
Georgists are hoping this will help them get through to ordinary
economists; but this device has the effect, by accident or design, of
minimizing estimates of the economic losses, or &#8220;excess
burdens,&#8221; that bad taxes cause. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The power of tax bias to keep land
from its best use is starkly
obvious by analyzing the economics of using marginal land. Any tax at
all will sterilize such land completely, unless the taxes are so
universal that the mobile factors, labor and capital, cannot escape
them by moving. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Who cares about marginal land?&#8221;,
some may say. The
distorting power of taxes has been demonstrated inadvertently by
Chicago-School economists Gale Johnson and Stephen Cheung. They have
shown that <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharecropping</span>, as a
private arrangement, creates a bias on
the part of tenants to substitute land for labor and equipment,
almost without limit. This is because extra land costs the cropper
nothing, unless it adds to output, so the cropper&#8217;s interest is
to substitute land, which is free to him, for his labor and capital,
which he pays for. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxes based on gross output affect
all landowners the same way the
cropshare lease affects croppers. They make every landowner a cropper
of the state, giving every landowner a motive to substitute land for
labor and capital indefinitely. Private landlords overcome this by
limiting how much land to allow each cropper; but the state has no
such offsetting control. Thus, each landowner&#8217;s motive to
acquire excess land runs wild. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In conjunction, consider that
taxes (other than property taxes)
are based solely on cash flows, thus entirely exempting all the
imputed income from and imputed consumption of the service flows of
land &#8211; the &#8220;amenities.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government
tells the landed
gentry, &#8220;Hold land as a totem, an heirloom, a private hunting
and riding park, a dream of future retirement, a speculation, a hedge
against inflation, an entry into high society, a beach access, a
protection against future neighbors, a shooting range, a golf course,
a ski hideaway, a drinking club, a private landing strip &#8230;
anything private and narcissistic or exclusionary or snobbish &#8230;
and your pleasures are tax exempt. Produce goods and services for
others, though, and we will treat you like a sharecropper &#8211; and
tax your employees, too.&#8221;</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now hark back to George&#8217;s second
force holding labor off the
better lands (Item A,3,b): <span style="font-weight: bold;">holding
land as a totem</span>. He noted that
tendency in an age before we even had an income tax, or state sales
taxes. Our present tax system magnifies the tendency beyond all
reason, resulting in the relegation of much of our best land to the
indulgences of the landed gentry, old and new. <a

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Very well; you just agree that this island is mine,
        and you may come ashore a free man.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;But how does the island happen to be yours? Did
        you make it?&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, what is your title, anyhow?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, my title is good enough. I got here first.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Of course he got there first. But he didn't mean to, and
        he wouldn't have done it if he could have helped it. But the newcomer
        is satisfied, and says:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, that's a good United States title, so I guess
        I'll recognize it and come ashore. But remember, I am to be a free man.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">For a time the two get along well enough together. But
        on some fine morning the proprietor concludes that he would rather lie
        abed than scurry around for his breakfast and not being in a good humor,
        perhaps, he somewhat roughly commands his &quot;brother man&quot; to
        cook him a bird.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What?&quot; exclaims the brother.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I tell you to go and kill a bird and cook it for
        my breakfast.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;That sounds big,&quot; sneers the second free and
        equal member of the little community; &quot;but what am I to get for
        doing this?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh,&quot; the first replies languidly, &quot;if
        you kill me a fat bird and cook it nicely, then after I have had my breakfast
        off the bird you may cook the gizzard for your own breakfast. That's
        pay enough. The work is easy.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;But I want you to understand that I am not your
        slave, and I won't do that work for that pay. I'll do as much work for
        you as you do for me, and no more.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then, sir,&quot; the first comer shouts in virtuous
        wrath, &quot;I want you to understand that my charity is at an end. I
        have treated you better than you deserved in the past, and this is your
        gratitude. Now I don't propose to have any loafers on my property. You
        will work for the wages I offer or get off my land! You are perfectly
        free. Take the wages or leave them. Do the work or let it alone. There
        is no slavery here. But if you are not satisfied with my terms, leave
        my island!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The second man, if accustomed to the usages of the labor
        unions, would probably go out and, to the music of his own violent language
        about the &quot;greed of capital,&quot; destroy as many bows and arrows
        as he could, so as to paralyze the bird-shooting industry; and this proceeding
        he would call a strike for honest wages and the dignity of labor. If
        he were accustomed to social reform notions of the namby-pamby variety,
        he would propose an arbitration, and be mildly indignant when told that
        there was nothing to arbitrate &#8212; that he had only to accept the
        other's offer or get off his property. But if a sensible man, he would
        notify his comrade that the privilege of owning islands in that latitude
        had expired. ...</font></p>

  <p><em><strong>c. The Law of Division of Labor and Trade</strong></em></p>
  <p>Now, what is it that leads men to conform their conduct to the principle
    illustrated by the last chart? Why do they divide their labor, and trade
    its products? A simple, universal and familiar law of human nature moves
    them. Whether men be isolated, or be living in primitive communities, or
    in advanced states of civilization, their demand for consumption determines
    the direction of Labor in production.67 That is the law. Considered in connection
    with a solitary individual, like Robinson Crusoe upon his island, it is obvious.
    What he demanded for consumption he was obliged to produce. Even as to the
    goods he collected from stranded ships &#8212; desiring to consume them,
    he was obliged to labor to produce them to places of safety. His demand for
    consumption always determined the direction of his labor in production.68
    And when we remember that what Robinson Crusoe was to his island in the sea,
    civilized man as a whole is to this island in space, we may readily understand
    the application of the same simple law to the great body of labor in the
    civilized world.69 Nevertheless, the complexities of civilized life are so
    likely to obscure its operation and disguise its relations to social questions
    like that of the persistence of poverty as to make illustration desirable.</p>

<p>Fred Foldvary: <a

A Plea to Public Economists</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who allege a relative
difficulty in separating the value of land from the value of
improvements lose sight of the main policy issue. The relative
efficiency of tapping geo-rent is that doing so imposes no marginal
cost on additional income, sales, or personal property. Condominiums
assign to each unit a fixed percentage interest in the association,
which is also its percentage of the assessments. This percentage
interest is often based on the site value of the unit relative to the
other units, i.e. its location and size, irrespective of any personal
property inside the unit, let alone the owners&#8217; income or spending.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Thousands of condominium associations are thus accomplishing
what some claim is impractical. They tap the site value of a unit
without reducing extra income or burdening extra spending or
possessions. Residential associations, hotels, and other private
communities do likewise with their rental charges and assessments.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Some private communities such as
shopping centers do practice modern sharecropping, basing some of their
charges on the gross revenue of the tenant shops as a way of sharing
risks,</span> but this is not an essential feature of private-community
financing....</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> <small><a

Question</a> (1881)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The best measure of rent is, of course,
    its proportion to the produce. The only estimate of Irish rent as a proportion
    of which I know is that of Buckle, who puts it at one-fourth of the produce.
    In this country I am inclined to think one-fourth would generally be considered
    a moderate rent. Even in California there is considerable land rented for
    one-third the crop, and some that rents for one-half the crop; while, according
    to a writer in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, the common rent in that
    great wheat-growing section of the New Northwest now being opened up is one-half
    the crop! ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>... In New York, in San Francisco, in Washington, Boston, Chicago,
      and St. Louis, live men who own large tracts of land which they seldom
      or never see. A resident of Rochester is said to own no less than four
      hundred farms in different States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky)
      comprises thirty-five thousand acres. Under the plantation system of farming
      and that of stock-raising on a grand scale, which are developing so rapidly
      in our new States, very much of the profits go to professional men and
      capitalists who live in distant cities. Corporations whose stock is held
      in the East or in Europe own much greater bodies of land, at much greater
      distances, than do the London corporations possessing landed estates in
      Ireland. To say nothing of the great land-grant railroad companies, the
      Standard Oil Company probably owns more acres of Western land than all
      the London companies put together own of Irish land. And, although landlordism
      in its grosser forms is only beginning in the United States, there is probably
      no American, wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity
      see some instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to concentration
      born of the new era ushered in by the application of steam shows itself
      in this way as in many others. To those who can live where they please,
      the great cities are becoming more and more attractive.</small><br>
                <br>
                <small>And it is further to be remarked that too much stress
                is laid upon absenteeism, and that it might be prevented without
                much of the evil often attributed to it being cured. That is
                to say, that to his tenantry and neighborhood the owner of land
                in Galway or Kilkenny would be as much an absentee if he lived
                in Dublin as if he lived in London, and that, if Irish landlords
                were compelled to live in Ireland, all that the Irish people
                would gain would be, metaphorically speaking, the crumbs that
                fell from the landlords' tables. For if the butter and eggs,
                the pigs and the poultry, of the Irish peasant must be taken
                from him and exported to pay for his landlord's wine and cigars,
                what difference does it make to him where the wine is drunk or
                the cigars are smoked? ... <span

  <p>PRIVATE property in land, no less than private property in slaves, is the

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter
25: The Robber That Takes All That Is Left - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT25.html">econlib</a>&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Both the transactions-costs and the rational-expectations approaches
    did in fact prove quite fruitful, but to Stiglitz and his fellow 2001 laureates,
    they were &quot;Ptolemaic&quot; &#8212; a reference to the bizarre complications
    Ptolemy had to introduce to the Earth-centered model of the Universe to keep
    it consistent with his astronomical observations of the Sun-centered reality
    (Stiglitz 2004). Both were seen by critics as brilliant but doomed attempts
    to preserve a false model. Akerlof, Stiglitz, and Spence drew inspiration
    instead from earlier work by James Mirrlees and William Vickrey. Mirrlees
    asked how a government should design a tax system. The ideal would be for
    everyone to be taxed according to his or her ability (and of course receive
    public services according to his or her needs); but the government doesn't
    know my ability, and if I'm a productive person I have every incentive to
    disguise this in order to minimize my tax bill. The tax system therefore
    has to use income as a proxy for ability (Mirrlees 1971).</p>
  <p>All of these economists started by noting in their own field of interest
    an institution which was blatantly nonrational and even dysfunctional. They
    asked why people would accede to an institution which was so obviously flawed.
    For Stiglitz, the institution was sharecropping, where the tenant farmer
    pays the landowner a large share of the crop rather than a fixed rent, often
    half or two-thirds. It seems inefficient because it's equivalent to an enormous
    tax on labor, massively denting the farmer's incentive to produce as much
    as possible. However, for the worker it is a better arrangement than renting:
    even if he has the cash to pay rent, he doesn't know how good the harvest
    will be, so sharecropping splits the risk with the landowner. For the landowner
    it's better than paying a wage unrelated to his effort or the output of the
    crop. There's uncertainty about the future and asymmetric information about
    the worker's skill and effort. In these circumstances, sharecropping is rational.

are another source of value.</span>
In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.

<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these

gave them away to owners

<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes. ...&nbsp;</small>
