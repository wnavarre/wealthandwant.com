  in wheat, corn, and potatoes. It may be fertile in cotton, in tobacco, or in
  rice. It may be fertile in diamonds, in gold, silver, copper, lead, or iron.
  It may be fertile in oil, coal, or natural gas, in a water power or water front.
  The value of artificial fertility is an improvement value. The value of natural
  fertility of any kind is a site value.</p>

<p>Alanna Hartzok: <a href="../docs/Hartzok_citdivs_oil.html">CITIZEN
    DIVIDENDS AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of
Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway&sup1;s citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income? <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The paper recommends full use
of information and communication
technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
(ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
possible distribution of citizen dividends.</small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Alaska relies on oil for about 80 percent of its revenue and
has no sales or income tax.</span> Alaska state government is mandated
to
invest 25% of its oil revenue into the APF while the other 75% of oil
royalty revenue is dispersed to other government funds to finance
education, infrastructure and social services. </small><br>
<br>
<small>If 100% of
Alaska&sup1;s oil royalties had been deposited into the APF, it is
conceivable that the CD this year could have been about $4,400 or
$17,600 for a family of four. But then there would have been no
funds for roads, education and other public services and no funds
available to run the state legislature - a libertarian dream
fulfillment or a social and economic disaster, which one we will
never know. If state services were to have been maintained while 100%
of oil royalties were deposited in the APF, there would of course
have been the need for income, sales and other taxes on wages and
production.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> At the end of the 2002 fiscal
year, the state of Alaska had a
deficit of nearly $400 million. State lawmakers frequently debate
whether the APF should be used to help run state government, but the
Fund is protected by law from being used for government expenditures.
Rather than cutting into the Fund and citizen dividends, others are
proposing an increase in oil rents and royalties from oil
corporations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> On February 5th of this year of
2004, several Democratic
Representatives filed legislation to help Alaskans recover a fairer
share for their oil. That same week former Alaska Governors Jay
Hammond and Wally Hickel stated that it is time to review the
fairness of oil tax exemptions contained in a 1989 law known as
<b>"the ELF</b>,<b>" or Economic Limit Factor</b>. Their viewpoint is that
ELF gives unjustified tax exemptions. The Alaska Fair Share bill
would redress the Economic Limit Factor and meet the constitutional
obligation to make sure Alaska&sup1;s oil provides &sup3;the maximum
benefit to the people&sup2; as mandated by the state
constitution.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Because of the ELF statute tax
breaks, Alaska&sup1;s oil
production tax rate has plummeted from 13.5% in 1993 to 7.5% today,
and by 2013, it would be down to 4% if the law is not changed. Also
because of ELF, 11 of the last 14 fields developed since 1989 pay
none or almost none of Alaska&sup1;s 15% Production Tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While the
state&sup1;s share for Alaska oil has fallen, corporate oil profits
have soared. </span>BP and Conoco Phillips reported net earnings of $9
billion and $7 billion respectively last year. According to the
Department of Revenue, at recent oil prices of $30 per barrel the
annual share corporations receive for Alaska oil would exceed total
state oil revenue by $1.2 billion.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The Alaska Fair Share bill
establishes a modest minimum
production tax of 5% and would raise an additional $400 million in
revenue this year. That approximates the current state budget gap.
The bill raises more at higher prices per barrel, and an additional
$100 million at average prices, according to the Department. The bill
also lets the state share in profits above $20 per barrel by slowly
increasing the severance tax above that price. To encourage
development, the Alaska Fair Share bill reduces the severance tax
rate at low prices, when companies face the prospect of reduced
profits, and possible investment losses. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>NORWAY</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Norway, one of the world's
richest economies, is a model of
prudent economic management of resource wealth. So states the IMF
2000 Article IV consultation with Norway. Norway is the top non-OPEC
oil exporter, the world's third-largest exporter of oil, and pumps
about 3.2 million barrels per day. Norway's oil and gas industry
underpins the economy, providing up to 25% of the country's gross
domestic product. This country of nearly four and one half million
people has a steady growth rate, almost no poverty, and negligible
unemployment. Norway has a diverse economy based on agriculture,
forestry, fishing and manufacturing, among other things, and its oil
industry has developed amid much planning, bargaining, and public
debate.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>NIGERIA</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Two thousand years ago, Pliny the
Elder wrote that the two
greatest curses of civilization were the discovery of silver and
gold. Perhaps oil and gas should be added to the list of natural
wealth that ends up damaging more then helping people in many parts
of the world that are rich in subsoil resources. This has certainly
been the case in Nigeria.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nigeria is potentially Africa's
richest country. As the world's
sixth largest producer of crude oil, with huge reserves of mineral
and agricultural riches and manpower, it should be enjoying some of
the highest global living standards. But it has some of the lowest
living standards in Africa. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Northern and southern Nigeria are
essentially two different
countries. Some view the oil producing region of the Niger Delta in
the south as a sort of internal colony of Nigeria. Home to 15 million
impoverished people, the Niger Delta region produces 90 percent of
Nigeria's wealth. Under the swamps and mangroves of one of the
world's richest ecosystems lie vast reserves - an estimated 40 more
years of crude and a century of natural gas. The first oil was
produced here in 1956. After 40 years of production, there are rutted
roads, decrepit schools, few health clinics, no conduits for running
water, and polluted creeks and farmlands. There have been dozens of
oil spills and gas flares spew carbon dioxide 24 hours a day. The
Niger Delta is one of this country's poorest regions, despite its oil
wealth. Most people are struggling to survive on less than $1 a day.
Away from the main towns there is no real development, no roads, no
electricity, no running water and no telephones.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Most of the oil that has earned
Nigeria close to US$340 billion
since production began over four decades ago has come from the Niger
Delta onshore sites. Some put the number at $300 billion with about
$50 billion &sup3;disappeared overseas&sup2; meaning stolen by
corrupt officials. Shell and other western oil companies extract oil
worth an estimated $150 billion a year in recent years from the area.
A rough estimate is that Nigeria earns some $10 billion every year
from oil. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What has become of
Nigeria&sup1;s oil wealth?</b> Nigeria
was rated the world&sup1;s most corrupt country (out of 52) by
Transparency International&sup1;s Corruption Perception Index. Much
has been made of the fact that money generated from Africa's oil
reserves has been lost in corruption, mismanagement and violent
conflict. In Nigeria, an estimated $4 billion in government funds was
stolen by the dictatorship of General Sani Abacha in the 1990s. Some
estimate that as much as $50 billion in oil revenue has been stolen
since Nigeria first began production.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The IMF and WB could have
insisted that a transparent oil rent
fund similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund be established as a
condition for loans. The fact that the international banking
institutions did not act in a responsible manner by promoting
transparent public finance institutions and socially just structural
adjustments programs but instead put countries into odious debt lends
credence to the position that these institutions were established to
maintain the predominance of the US dollar as the major global
currency over and above any humanitarian or even good governance
objectives. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Hartzok_citdivs_oil.html">Read

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me therefore that we
need to face up to the question
that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
Federalism, that is, how is money
going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities? ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>The reason it's so hard to sell growth policies at the local
level
today in the United States is very much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he
United States federal government taxes people and it gives
subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to landlords. So the
landlords can get the
subventions without having the people. So who needs people?</span>
That's it
in a nutshell. We need to reverse that, I think, if we're going to be
able to make Georgism work at the local level. ... </small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between
the federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both
countries we find something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which
means that the senior governments send money to the junior
governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the
poorer governments, those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than
to richer ones. ... </small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
&nbsp;... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's Law</span>. ...
But the general idea is, you may
think you have tenure control of land but if the municipal government
can tax that land and use that money to finance public welfare
services, public education and other things that are open to all
comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution of
population. ... </small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
At the same time, in both countries you find something I will call
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammer's Law</span>. This is not a
carpenter's tool but again the name of a
man, an economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that if you
compared population to land values in the different counties of his
State (in the very poor counties of the Ozarks the land was hard
scrabble land of very little value, with the very rich lands in the
north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you found that
the population density was much greater on the very poor land of the
Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest. ... </small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
Now another similarity to the two countries us that the
subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
you remember means equalization among the different
jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something like
that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose
Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
similarities.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>
</small><br>
<small>
The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
Washington. ... So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
But that's another story.) <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful
distinction about Canadians is the strong
and explicit recognition among almost everyone, even if he's an
economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span>
<b>Equalisation in Canadian politics means sharing the economic
rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a
permissible word in polite discourse. It's very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However
there's a very selective attitude towards rent -- towards what rents
are shareable, I should say.</span> </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Forest revenues are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Water power is fair game. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents that
are generated by the valuable
lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big and
powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair
game.</i></b> As a matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print
of the equalization law, which I did on the airplane, you find the
most interesting exception to what's included in the formula. I'll
explain the formula to you in a moment if you are still awake.<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Now let's look at the sharing
  formula. <b>The sharing formula in
  Canada is essentially based on population and potential tax base.</b>
  And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've boiled
  it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
  population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax
  base that it has, subtract that and that gives you another
  percentage. And then you multiply that times the total tax revenue
  that's collected throughout Canada from that tax source, and then you
  pay them that amount out of the provincial treasury. <font size="+1">... </font></b></small></p>
  <b>Royalties</b>
  <p>The next episode in this drama might be called 'the Empire strikes back',
    with John Turner as Darth Vader. This was back in '74 or so. He said, since
    these pesky western provinces are collecting so much economic rent from their
    Crown lands by raising their royalties and going up with the market, what
    we are now going to do is to fool hem. We are going to say that these royalties
    are not deductibles for federal income tax purposes. And since all the provincial
    income taxes are piggybacked on to the federal tax, or most of them, that
    also went for provincial income tax purposes. Thus in effect the provinces
    were penalised for this effort to collect economic rent at the provincial
    level. This had two objectives. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The good reason and the obvious reason was to protect the federal revenues. </li>
    <li>But the subtler one, I think, was one of protecting the major rent barons
      by assuring that the provinces would not get carried away with raising
      their royalties. In effect, the provincial governments were being penalised
      by the federal government for raising royalties. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>And although in the short run this obviously damaged the lessees and they
    screamed bloody murder in the not so long run it forced the provinces to
    back off on their royalties and it certainly forced them to sell their leaseholds
    for lower prices in he future. Those that hadn't yet been sold because the
    anticipation that the roya1ties would not be deductible. So as it was viewed
    in the western provinces, and I think correctly, this was an attempt on the
    part of the government in Ottawa to protect the absentee owners of western
    resources from provincial populism. </p>
  <p>It must not be forgotten that John Turner got his training with the Bechtel
    Corporation, just like George Schultz, or perhaps with him. </p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conclusion of all this is that
the Canadian system is
really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described,
are essentially based on population. Population is in the formula.
And if you compare this with the way things are done in the States,
population plays a very minor role in the formula for equalisation
payments in the United States. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, how should it be done?
Well, there's a well known Georgist
economist who figured this out a long time ago and wrote an article
about it. His name is Colin Clark. ... He came up with a plan for
collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what we
really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation
payment, is <i>we should classify local jurisdictions according to
land value per capita, and those that have the least land value per
capita, we'll leave all of that land value for them to use for local
purposes. But then we will graduate the federal land tax according to
the amount of land value per capita in the jurisdiction, and thus we
will have a federal tax that automatically achieves inter-regional
equity, without all this razzmatazz that I've been describing about
inter-regional equalisation payments. </i><a style="font-weight: bold;"

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    Limits of Public Ownership</p>
  <p>Because of historical circumstances, America has a long tradition of public
    land ownership. When Europeans first arrived, North America was held in common
    by an assortment of tribes. As these tribes were dispossessed, the federal
    government acquired their territories. Some of the federal holdings were
    given to states as they entered the union. Though most of what the federal
    and state governments owned was then sold cheaply, much was retained. Today,
    nearly a third of the land in the United States is government-owned.</p>
  <p>To say that land &#8212; or any asset &#8212; is &#8220;government-owned,&#8221; however,
    isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s managed on behalf of future generations, nonhuman
    species, or ordinary citizens. Consider what the federal and state governments
    have done with the lands they own.</p>
  <p>Outside of Alaska, about 5 percent of government-owned lands have been designated
    as wilderness. In such areas, humans may enter on foot but not use motorized
    vehicles. Mining, logging, and hunting are also prohibited. On the other
    95 percent of government-owned land, private and commercial use is regulated
    by various agencies. National forests are managed by the U.S. Forest Service,
    grazing and mineral lands by the Bureau of Land Management, hunting and fishing
    by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, politics &#8212; not fiduciary duty &#8212; determines
    what uses are permitted and what prices are charged.<strong> A classic example
    is the Mining Act of 1872, under which private companies can stake claims
    to
    mineral-bearing lands for $5 an acre, and pay no royalties on the
    minerals they extract. </strong>Every attempt to reform this antiquated law has failed because
    of the mining companies&#8217; political clout.</p>
  <p>In the same vein, the U.S. Forest Service has for decades been selling trees
    to timber companies for below-market prices. On top of that, it spends billions
    of tax dollars building roads in virgin forests so timber firms can harvest
    the people&#8217;s trees. This is, of course, economically irrational and
    a huge subsidy to private corporations. It also addicts Americans to cheap
    forest products and destructive logging methods. These practices occur because
    the Forest Service is not a trust committed to ecosystem preservation, but
    a politically influenced agency dedicated to &#8220;multiple use&#8221; of
    government-owned forests.</p>
  <p>There are exceptions to this dismal pattern. One involves trust lands given
    by the federal government to states. Such gifts began with the Land Ordinance
    of 1785, which reserved one square mile per township for the support of public
    schools. Later, the Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862 gave more land
    to states to support colleges of agriculture and mechanics. <strong>And in 1954,
    Congress gave Texas title to oil-rich coastal lands, providing that all revenue
    from them be placed in an endowment, or permanent fund, that generates income
    for public schools forever.</strong></p>
  <p>Today, twenty-two states hold about 155 million acres in trust for public
    schools and colleges &#8212; which is to say, for future generations. <strong>Like
    the federal government, the state trusts lease much of their land for oil
    drilling, timber cutting, and cattle grazing. </strong>The trusts&#8217; duty is to
    preserve not the land itself but the income streams it generates. This creates
    beneficiaries (educators, students, parents) who monitor the land managers
    closely. One result, according to University of California professor Sally
    Fairfax, is that state trust lands are better managed than federally owned
    lands. Whereas the U.S. Forest Service &#8220;has been hiding the ball on
    cash flows and returns to investments for most of this century . . . the
    state trust land managers know how to keep books and make them public.&#8221; Further,
    even though the state trusts aren&#8217;t bound to protect ecosystems per
    se, they tend to do so because they have a long-term calculus.</p>
  <p>An interesting variant of the typical state land trust is the Alaska Permanent
    Fund, created in 1976 to absorb some of the windfall from leasing state land
    to oil companies. The aim was to create an endowment that would benefit Alaskans
    even after the oil is gone. To this end, the Permanent Fund invests in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and off the earnings pays yearly dividends to
    every resident. Originally, the dividends were to be allocated in proportion
    to the recipients&#8217; length of residence in Alaska, with old-timers getting
    more than newcomers. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, because of the
    Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Alaska couldn&#8217;t
    discriminate against newcomers that way. The dividend formula was then changed
    to one person, one share. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
