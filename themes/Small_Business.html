  <p>There is an important distinction to be made between those small businesses
    which engage in business, and those which engage in landlording. Our incentives
    should be designed to encourage entrepreneurship, not landlording or land
    speculation.  To the extent that we fail to distinguish between genuine entrepreneurship
    and engaging in reaping a windfall from public investment in infrastructure,
    we fail to protect the commons from privatization, to our detriment.</p>
  <p>It is said that small business is responsible for a large share of job creation
    in the US. That may be true, but the other half of the equation is seldom
    stated: that <strong>a large share of the unemployment in this country is
    also a result of small businesses which suffer downturns</strong>. Sometimes the downturn
    is as simple as the landlord increasing the rent for a retailer or other
    small business which depends on being in a site accessible to customers,
    employees and inventory. The landlord may not provide any more amenities
    within the building or property than he did last year, but he can raise the
    rent, making it unaffordable to the small business. And his rent increase
    comes because he thinks the market can take it &#8212; that either this tenant
    or some other will be willing to pay the increased price because of the quality
    of the location. We tend to forget, though, that it is the community's investment
    in public services &#8212; roads, bridges, sanitary and stormwater sewers,
    city water, parks, schools, emergency services, transportation systems, hospital
    emergency rooms, etc., &#8212; and the private sector's presence, which
    makes his site valuable.</p>
  <p>Small businesses which own their sites can go on for generations, even when
    the business would not be viable if the owner had to pay market rent to a
    landlord or to the community for the value of the site. A diner remains in
    the middle of a downtown business district, rather than being replaced by
    a midrise or highrise building with a coffeeshop on the street level. The
    owner gets to continue his business, uninterrupted by a year of construction
    &#8212; but the effect on his town is to force growth to the fringe &#8212;    otherwise
    known as
    sprawl. </p>

    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3. Of the effect upon individuals
    and classes</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic, storekeeper,
    or professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives,
    and
      which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family
    cannot be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary,
    he
      will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish -- theoretically
      it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear.
    It will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other
    lots
      will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
      of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser
    only as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be
    a loser
      by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
      to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead
      owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting
    a larger lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of
    their own,
      he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present,
    other things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have
    more
      taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house
    and improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that
    he and
      his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
      by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
      of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
      another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain. ... </p>
  <p>In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well as
      a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made. His
      loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
      is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
      or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
      a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
      but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even if universal history did
not teach the lesson, it is in the
United States already becoming very evident that political equality
can continue to exist only upon a basis of social equality; that
where the disparity in the distribution of wealth increases,
political democracy only makes easier the concentration of power, and
must inevitably lead to tyranny and anarchy. And it is already
evident that there is nothing in political democracy, nothing in
popular education, nothing in any of our American institutions, to
prevent the most enormous disparity in the distribution of wealth.
Nowhere in the world are such great fortunes growing up as in the
United States. Considering that the average income of the working
masses of our people is only a few hundred dollars a year, a fortune
of a million dollars is a monstrous thing &#8211; a more monstrous and
dangerous thing under a democratic government than anywhere else. Yet
fortunes of ten and twelve million dollars are with us ceasing to be
noticeable. We already have citizens whose wealth can be estimated
only in hundreds of millions, and before the end of the century, if
present tendencies continue, we are likely to have fortunes estimated
in thousands of millions &#8211; such monstrous fortunes as the world
has never seen since the growth of similar fortunes ate out the heart
of Rome. And the necessary correlative of the growth of such fortunes
is the impoverishment and loss of independence on the part of the
masses. These great aggregations of wealth are like great trees,
which strike deep roots and spread wide branches, and which, by
sucking up the moisture from the soil and intercepting the sunshine,
stunt and kill the vegetation around them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a capital of a
million dollars comes into competition with capitals of thousands of
dollars, the smaller capitalists must be driven out of the business
or destroyed. With great capital nothing can compete save great
capital. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hence, every
aggregation of wealth increases the tendency to
the aggregation of wealth, and decreases the possibility of the
employee ever becoming more than an employee, compelling him to
compete with his fellows as to who will work cheapest for the great
capitalist &#8211; a competition that can have but one result, that of
forcing wages to the minimum at which the supply of labor can be kept
up.</span> Where we are is not so important as in what direction we are
going, and in the United States all tendencies are clearly in this
direction. A while ago, and any journeyman shoemaker could set up in
business for himself with the savings of a few months. But now the
operative shoemaker could not in a lifetime save enough from his
wages to go into business for himself. And, now that great capital
has entered agriculture, it must be with the same results. The large
farmer, who can buy the latest machinery at the lowest cash prices
and use it to the best advantage, who can run a straight furrow for
miles, who can make special rates with railroad companies, take
advantage of the market, and sell in large lots for the least
commission, must drive out the small farmer of the early American
type just as the shoe factory has driven out the journeyman
shoemaker. And this is going on today. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is often assumed that the
labor question is a question
between wage-workers and their employers; but working for an employer
is not the primary or exclusive occupation of labor. Primarily men
work for themselves without the intervention of an employer. And the

for himself and consumes his own products receiving his wages in the
fruits of his labor.</small></div>

of an employer?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In considering remedies these
workers are seldom thought of.
Yet in reality the laborers who work for themselves should be first
considered, since what men will be willing to accept from employers
depends manifestly on what they can get by working for themselves.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is assumed that all employers
are rich men, who might raise
wages much higher were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact
that the great majority of employers are as much pressed by competition

Such employers could not raise the wages they pay, however they might
wish to, unless all others were compelled to do so.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is assumed that there are in the natural order two classes,
the rich and the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.
It is true that there are differences in capacity, in diligence, in
health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor.
The natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not
greater than are natural differences in stature. But while it is only
by selecting giants and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as
others, yet in the difference between rich and poor that exists today
we find some men richer than others by the thousand-fold and the
million-fold! ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/WoL.htm"> <span

<blockquote>
  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:
Book III, Chapter 17, The Production of Wealth: The Third Factor of Production &#8212; Capital</a> &#8226;<a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_10.htm"> abridged:
Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</a><br>
<br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

<br>
THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included
either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which are neither
land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these two original
factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book
I, Chapter 2: Wages and Capital: The Meaning of the Terms</a><br>
<br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book
III, Chapter 4: The Laws of Distribution: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits
Often Mistaken For Interest</a></p>
  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
      <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
    <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book

government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Might the PTS fall heavily on low-income land
holders and elderly homeowners? The land-rich, money-poor old widow
could suffer if society were to levy sites. Eventho' the vast majority
of poor people would come out ahead, there probably will be the rare
exception. To deal with "the widow on a valuable lot", the new policy
could include <span style="font-weight: bold;">deferments</span>.<br>
<br>
Just as some poor could pay more, some rich could pay less, such as the
owners of a skyscraper that'd be the highest (literally) and best use
of a site. While a PTS could be a tax break for a few, the intent of
the shift is not so much to whittle away fortunes as it is to promote
prosperity, equity, and sustainability. Were society to attain such
goals, letting some fortunes escape unscathed is a small price to pay.
Also, putting a site to best use, while profitable, also benefits the
community by providing convenient employment, bringing money into the
local economy, and by precluding less efficient development, such as
sprawl.<br>
<br>
Since the shift is progressive, then the rich are footing the bill for
everyone else. To answer this charge that one group will pay more
(those who can afford it), proponents could note that the amount one
pays is scaled according to the value of what one takes -- a parcel of
nature. The payment is for exclusive use to our common heritage. Those
who exclude the rest from the best must expect to pay the most.<br>
<br>
An obvious loser is a resource extractor such as an Oregon timber
harvester (Weyerhauser is the biggest landowner in the state). All the
rent that society now allows them to retain, they'd lose. Perhaps there
is a silver lining to corporate mergers and diversification and
interlocking stock holding; the huge corporations holding resources
would have other profitable lines to turn to.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">An obvious winner, balancing the
losses of the extractor, are the
service-providing companies located off the beaten path, like a
neighborhood cafe. After centuries of just getting by, smaller
enterprises would gain by competing on a level playing field. What
they'd gain (that is, retain) is the fruit of their labor.</span>
Conversely,
what big business would lose is the commonwealth generated by all. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two
other groups who have yet to
fly the PTS banner but who stand to
gain substantially are small businesses and service businesses (often
the same). </span>For a small business (this writer used to work in
his
father's), taxes are a double levy -- the tax owed and the fee for the
accountant. Big companies have an easier time absorbing the costs of
recording, verifying, and paying taxes. The simplification of taxation
inherent in the PTS could appeal to small business people.<br>
<br>
The other potentially supportive businesses -- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">service </span>providers -- do
not consume much in the way of resources or prime locations. Even
service providers on valuable sites, were they to pay more, could still
come out ahead in the better business climate of zero taxes on sales,
on paid wages, on customers' income, and of less onerous mortgage.
Presently taxes and mortgages consume about 65% of the average worker's
income, drastically reducing discretionary spending.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Pseudo-Socialism</small></small></a><br>
<a href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Gaffney_OaGL.html"><small>
</small></a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All that may sound familiar to
students of 19th Century American
history, and the privatization of the vast Federal domain. It is a
long story of conflict between cash sales and more democratic means
of placing lands. Those with cash and bank connections naturally
favored cash sales. President Jefferson saw the merit in credit
sales, so from 1801-20, sales were on credit. The system was badly
administered, but so were all other systems of land disposal tried in
that era. Collections became a problem, yet landownership was
democratized. It enabled Andrew Jackson to proclaim on Thanksgiving
Day, 1835, "We thank Thee for the absence of unemployment which in
the King-ridden countries of the world is causing widespread
suffering among the toiling masses and has led to riots ... (and
that) there will be none to freeze, starve, or be beset by the fear
of want this winter or the winters yet to come." </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Following the period of credit
sales, the return to cash sales
re-introduced front-money bias. Small owners still had ways of
fighting back at the state and local levels. States and counties and
their subdivisions relied mainly on the property tax. They used this
with good effect, often quite deliberately, to induce absentee
speculators to release large holdings for sale and settlement. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
impact of land taxes is analogous to that of credit sales. The
specter of future taxes is capitalized into lower current land
prices. </span>They in turn let one buy cheaper up front, in return
for a
higher level of deferred payments. The net effect is like extending
permanent credit on equal terms to all potential buyers, something
private credit markets never do or could be expected to do. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, the property tax,
especially on land, is twice effective as
an instrument of Distributive Socialism. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it rifles in on the rent surplus and socializes it.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, it democratizes
the ownership and operating control of
land.</span> </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus it achieves something akin to
the "worker control" that is an
ideal avowed by many modern Socialists, melding egalitarian
distribution with egalitarian management and control.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> To be sure, it
does so in a small-business framework, an ideal that is traditionally
Populist, not Marxist.</span> However, in this new post-Communist age,
when
Socialists are seeking new ways to express their yearnings for the
good society, they might want to reconsider the value of this
approach to worker control. Perhaps Marx, like other reformers of his
generation, was oversold on the economies and inevitable triumph of
large scale capital and organization, and the substitution of capital
for labor. Perhaps small is beautiful, after all. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today's industry is faced less
with the property tax than the
income tax. Most state property taxes are applied only at low levels
to mineral-bearing lands. Worse, the most active leasing today is on
the OCS, outside the tax reach of any state or county, and so exempt
from property taxation. ... <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The invisible, pervasive change is
due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using Gwartney's Rule of Thumb (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners are only taxed now if
they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. <span

oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out.</span> This helps us segue from being at the cutting

of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was different then? We had
high property tax rates, but they
were more focused on land than now, less on new buildings. Another
obvious difference was the lower burdens of sales tax, business tax,

than perhaps any other state, shown by its long run of Georgist
political action in the prior thirty years. Most people today are
totally ignnorant of this subject. It has been deleted from our

</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT
IS MISSING
FROM THE CAPITAL GAINS DEBATE?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ... </span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The most frequently
heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span> </small><br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span> </small><br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small>14 Some argue that
eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate
cut. See Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 2 1; Gaffney (1991).<br>
</small><small>15 For an analysis of the case for inflation indexing,
see
Gaffney (1991).
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock
market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Reported capital gains in real estate were understated as a
result of
exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as
land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land -- raiders bought publicly
traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
were capital gains.</small>
