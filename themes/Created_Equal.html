<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural.  Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of the citizen, and  political organization always starts from this base. <strong>It is as social  development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make  the many the slaves of the few. </strong>How this is we may see. In all  institutions which involve the lodgment of governing power there is,  with social growth, a tendency to the exaltation of their function and  the centralization of their power, and in the stronger of these  institutions a tendency to the absorption of the powers of the rest.  Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government the business  of a special class. And as numbers increase and the power and  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all,  so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny  and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head  man of a little village, can command or govern only by common consent,  and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his fellows. But when a  tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a populous country,  the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition, become  practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to  appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes  irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as power thus  concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of thought grows  up which regards the masses as born but for the service of their rulers. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

  Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    We hold: That&#8212;</p>
  <p>This world is the creation of God.</p>
  <p>The men brought into it for the brief period of their earthly lives are
    the equal creatures of his bounty, the equal subjects of his provident care.</p>
  <p>By his constitution man is beset by physical wants, on the satisfaction
    of which depend not only the maintenance of his physical life but also the
    development of his intellectual and spiritual life.</p>
  <p>God has made the satisfaction of these wants dependent on man&#8217;s own
    exertions, giving him the power and laying on him the injunction to labor &#8212; a
    power that of itself raises him far above the brute, since we may reverently
    say that it enables him to become as it were a helper in the creative work.</p>
  <p>God has not put on man the task of making bricks without straw. With the
    need for labor and the power to labor he has also given to man the material
    for labor. This material is land &#8212; man physically being a land animal,
    who can live only on and from land, and can use other elements, such as air,
    sunshine and water, only by the use of land.</p>
  <p>Being the equal creatures of the Creator, equally entitled under his providence
    to live their lives and satisfy their needs, men are equally entitled to
    the use of land, and any adjustment that denies this equal use of land is
    morally wrong.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large

    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being

    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.</strong>    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
    new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
    never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
    the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the Bishop of
    Meath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit
      filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>  6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
      in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      <strong>The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private
      property in land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is
      land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</strong></p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? <strong>Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</strong></p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!
    <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers and
    their employers. But working for wages is not the primary or exclusive occupation
    of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention of an
    employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of labor, the
    man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving his wages
    in the fruits of his labor. Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers, peddlers,
    working farmers &#8212; all, in short, of the many workers who get their
    wages directly by the sale of their services or products without the medium
    of an employer, as much laborers as those who work for the specific wages
    of an employer? In your consideration of remedies you do not seem even to
    have thought of them. Yet in reality the laborers who work for themselves
    are the first to be considered, since what men will be willing to accept
    from employers depends manifestly on what they can get by working for themselves.</p>
  <p>You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much higher
    were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great majority
    of employers are in reality as much pressed by competition as their workmen,
    many of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such employers could not
    possibly raise the wages they pay, however they might wish to, unless all
    others were compelled to do so.</p>
  <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
    the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
    however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
    natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
    are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
    and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
    between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
    men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it,
    what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
    deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The
    existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p><strong>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights
      we do not seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by
      faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all. </strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
    article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Evidently this regard for the general good is the true principle of taxation.
    The more it is examined the more clearly it will be seen that there is no
    valid reason why we should, in any case, attempt to tax all property. <strong>That
    equality should be the rule and aim of taxation is true, and this for the
    reason given in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created
    equal. But equality does not require that all men should be taxed alike,
    or that all things should be taxed alike. It merely requires that whatever
    taxes are imposed shall be equally imposed upon the persons or things in
    like conditions or situations; it merely requires that no citizen shall be
    given an advantage, or put at a disadvantage, as compared with other citizens.</strong></p>
  <p> The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the
    Constitution of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence.
    To insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to
    each individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit
    of happiness &#8212; these are the proper ends of government, and are therefore
    the ends which in every scheme of taxation should be kept in mind. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>Now <strong>discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to equally
    tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the true rule, that
    taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion of the general prosperity,
    the securing of substantial equality, and the recognition of inalienable
    rights, let us consider upon what species of property it may be best laid.</strong></p>
  <p> To consider what is included in the category of property is to see the
    absurdity of saying that all property should be equally taxed. For not to
    speak of minor differences that arise from application and use, there are
    commonly included under this term things of essentially different nature.
    Whatever is recognized by municipal law as subject to ownership is property.
    But between things thus classed together are wide differences. In the first
    place, there are certain of them which have in themselves no value, but are
    merely the representatives or doubles of property in itself valuable. Such
    are stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes of all kinds, whether made
    by individuals or issued by governments to serve as money, solvent debts,
    book-accounts, etc. These things may be to the individual valuable property,
    and are correctly included in any estimate of his wealth. But they are no
    part of the wealth of the community. Their increase does not make the community
    a whit the richer; and they may be utterly destroyed without the community
    becoming a whit the poorer. If I buy a horse, giving my note for the amount,
    the result of the transaction (supposing me to be solvent) is that the seller
    gets property to the value of the horse, while I get the horse. But there
    has been no increase in wealth. To the seller, my note may be quite as good
    as the horse, and in estimating his wealth it may be as properly included
    as the horse; but if the note be destroyed, the community is nothing the
    poorer, while if the horse break his neck, there is a lessening of the general
    wealth by one horse. And so, the issuance of bonds by a government, or the
    watering of stock by a corporation, can in no wise increase the general sum
    of wealth, nor will any diminution either in the amount or in the selling
    price of such bonds or stock reduce it. If all the governments of the world
    were to repudiate their debts tomorrow, an immense amount of property, now
    carefully guarded, would become waste paper, and thousands of people now
    rich would be made poor, but the wealth of the human race would not be diminished
    one iota.<br />
    <br />
  These are truisms. Yet so widespread and persistent is the notion that all
  property should be taxed, that they are generally ignored. Nothing is clearer
  than that when a farmer who wants more capital puts a mortgage on his farm,
  no new value is thereby created. Yet, in most of our States, both the farm
  and the mortgage are taxed; though so obvious is the double taxation that in
  some of them the clumsy expedient of making an exemption to the debtor is resorted
  to.</p>
  <p> But it is manifest that property of this kind is not a fit subject for
    taxation, and ought not to be considered in making up the assessment rolls.
    It has, in itself, no value. It is merely the representative, or token, of
    value &#8212; the certificate of ownership, or the obligation to pay value.
    It either represents other property, or property yet to be brought into existence.
    And, as nothing real can be drawn from that which is not real, taxation upon
    property of this kind must ultimately fall, either upon the property represented,
    in which case there is double taxation, or upon those whose obligations it
    expresses, in which case men are taxed, not upon what they own, but upon
    what they owe; and all cumbrous devices to prevent the unjust effects of
    such taxation, like other complications of the revenue system, simply give
    to the stronger and more unscrupulous opportunities of throwing the burden
    upon the weaker and more conscientious. Property of this kind ought not to
    be taxed at all. Property in itself valuable is clearly that with which any
    wise scheme of taxation should alone deal.</p>
  <p> To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. <strong>The true
    distinction is between property which is, and property which is not, the
    result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. </strong>Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. <strong>The one is the free gift of Nature, the
    other the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. </strong>To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p> For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. We may
    tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. We might take the whole value
    of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p> And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production.</p>
  <p> To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p> See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p> Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p> So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, <strong>above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest
    justice.</strong>    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and <strong>to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</strong></p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

        whether you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine,
        or the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference
        either to him or to them. In the one case, as the other, the one will
        be the absolute master of the ninety-nine &#8212; his power extending
        even to life and death, for simply to refuse them permission to live
        upon the island would be to force them into the sea.</p>
      <p>Upon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause
        must operate in the same way and to the same end &#8212; the ultimate
        result, the enslavement of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure
        increases which compels them to live on and from land which is treated
        as the exclusive property of others.</p>
      <p>Yet, it will be said: <strong>As every man has a right to the use and
          enjoyment of nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the
          exclusive
        right to its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his labor</strong>.
        But there is no difficulty in determining where the individual right
        ends and the common right begins. A delicate and exact test is supplied
        by value, and with its aid there is no difficulty, no matter how dense
        population may become, in determining and securing <strong>the exact rights of
        each, the equal rights of all.</strong></p>
      <p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is
        not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines
        its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is
        no better than other land which may be had for the using can have no
        value. And the value of land always measures the difference between it
        and the best land that may be had for the using. Thus, the value of land
        expresses in exact and tangible form the right of the community in land
        held by an individual; and <em><strong>rent expresses the exact amount
        which the individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal

    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      ...</p>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of
      nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes,
      as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain. ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay.<strong> It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature. </strong>Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.</strong> This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless <strong>slavery</strong> in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read the whole

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... When we consider the
achievements of humanity and then look upon
the misery that exists today in the very centres of wealth; upon the
ignorance, the weakness, the injustice, that characterise our highest
civilisation, we may know of a surety that it is not the fault of
God; it is the fault of humanity. May we not know that in that very
power that God has given to His children here, in that power of
rising higher, there is involved &#8212; and necessarily involved
&#8212; the power of falling lower. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All-Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour!<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few!</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There was a little dialogue
published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men;&#8221; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it happens that all over
the civilised world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
forth.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I want to impress upon those who
    may read this book is this:</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The land question is nowhere a mere local question; it is a universal
      question. It involves the great problem of the distribution of wealth,
      which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by measures which in their nature can have but
    local application. It can be settled only by measures which in their nature
    will apply everywhere.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by half-way measures. It can be settled only
    by the acknowledgment of equal rights to land. Upon this basis it can be
    settled easily and permanently.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If the Irish reformers take this ground, they will make their fight
    the common fight of all the peoples; they will concentrate strength and divide
    opposition. They will turn the flank of the system that oppresses them, and
    awake the struggle in its very intrenchments. They will rouse against it
    a force that is like the force of rising tides.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the men of Ireland to do is to proclaim, without limitation
    or evasion, that the land, of natural right, is the common property of the
    whole people, and to propose practical measures which will recognize this
    right in all countries as well as in Ireland.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the Land Leagues of the United States to do is to announce
    this great principle as of universal application; to give their movement
    a reference to America as well as to Ireland; to broaden and deepen and strengthen
    it by making it a movement for the regeneration of the world &#8211; a movement
    which shall concentrate and give shape to aspirations that are stirring among
    all nations.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Ask not for Ireland mere charity or sympathy. Let her call be the
    call of <strong>fraternity</strong>: "For yourselves, O brothers, as well
    as for us!" Let her rallying cry awake all who slumber, and rouse to a common
    struggle all who are oppressed. Let it breathe not old hates; let it ring
    and echo with the new hope!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>In many lands her sons are true to her; under many skies her daughters
    burn with the love of her. Lo! the ages bring their opportunity. Let those
    who would honor her bear her banner to the front!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The harp and the shamrock, the golden sunburst on the field of living
    green! emblems of a country without nationality; standard of a people downtrodden
    and oppressed! The hour has come when they may lead the van of the great
    world-struggle. Types of harmony and of ever-springing hope, of light and
    of life! The hour has come when they may stand for something higher than
    local patriotism; something grander than national independence. The hour
    has come when they may stand forth to speak the world's hope, to lead the
    world's advance!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Torn away by pirates, tending in a strange land a heathen master's
    swine, the slave boy, with the spirit of Christ in his heart, praying in
    the snow for those who had enslaved him, and returning to bring to his oppressors
    the message of the gospel, returning with good to give where evil had been
    received, to kindle in the darkness a great light&#8211;this is Ireland's
    patron saint. In his spirit let Ireland's struggle be. Not merely through
    Irish vales and hamlets, but into England, into Scotland, into Wales, wherever
    our common tongue is spoken, let the torch be carried and the word be preached.
    And beyond! The brotherhood of man stops not with differences of speech any
    more than with seas or mountain-chains. A century ago it was ours to speak
    the ringing word. Then it was France's. Now it may be Ireland's, if her sons
    be true.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But wherever, or by whom, the word must be spoken, the standard will
    be raised. No matter what the Irish leaders do or do not do, it is too late
    to settle permanently the question on any basis short of the recognition
    of equal natural right. And, whether the Land Leagues move forward or slink
    back, the agitation must spread to this side of the Atlantic. The Republic,
    the true Republic, is not yet here. But her birth-struggle must soon begin.
    Already, with the hope of her, men's thoughts are stirring.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Not a republic of landlords and peasants; not a republic of millionaires
    and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and some serve. But
    a republic of equal citizens, where competition becomes cooperation, and
    the interdependence of all gives true independence to each; where moral progress
    goes hand in hand with intellectual progress, and material progress elevates
    and enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>And the gospel of deliverance, let us not forget it: it is the gospel
    of love, not of hate. He whom it emancipates will know neither Jew nor Gentile,
    nor Irishman nor Englishman, nor German nor Frenchman, nor European nor American,
    nor difference of color or of race, nor animosities of class or condition.
    Let us set our feet on old prejudices, let us bury the old hates. There have
    been "Holy Alliances" of kings. Let us strive for the Holy Alliance of the
    people.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberty, equality, fraternity! Write
    them on the banners. Let them be for sign and countersign. Without equality,
    liberty cannot be; without fraternity, neither equality nor liberty can be
    achieved.</span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Liberty&#8211;the full freedom of each bounded only by the equal
      freedom of every other!</small></li>
  <li><small>Equality&#8211;the equal right of each to the use and enjoyment
      of all natural opportunities, to all the essentials of happy, healthful,
      human life!</small></li>
  <li><small>Fraternity&#8211;that sympathy which links together those who struggle
      in a noble cause; that would live and let live; that would help as well
      as be helped; that, in seeking the good of all, finds the highest good
      of each!</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"By this sign shall ye conquer!"</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>"We hold these truths to be self-evident&#8211;that all men are
      created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>It is over a century since these words rang out. It is time
          to give them their full, true meaning. Let the standard be lifted that
          all may see it; let the advance be sounded that all may hear it. Let
          those who would fall back, fall back. Let those who would oppose, oppose.
          Everywhere are those who will rally. The stars in their courses fight
          against Sisera!... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> IF we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all
  here with an equal title to the enjoyment of His bounty &#8212; with an equal
  right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
  which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human
  being as he enters the world, and which, during his continuance in the world,
  can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
  thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
  make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
  to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
  who follow them. For what are we but tenants for a day? Have we made the earth
  that we should determine the rights of those who after us shall tenant it in
  their turn? The Almighty, who created the earth for man and man for the earth,
  has entailed it upon all the generations of the children of men by a decree
  written upon the constitution of all things &#8212; a decree which no human
  action can bar and no prescription determine, Let the parchments be ever so
  many, or possession ever so long, natural justice can recognize no right in
  one man to the possession and enjoyment of land that is not equally the right
  of all his fellows. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> HAS the first comer at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs
    and claim that none of the other guests shall partake of the food provided,
    except as they make terms with him? Does the first man who presents a ticket
    at the door of a theater and passes in, acquire by his priority the right
    to shut the doors and have the performance go on for him alone? Does the
    first passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his
    baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after him
    to stand up? <br>
              <br>
  The cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests at a banquet
  continually spread, spectators and participants in an entertainment where there
  is room for all who come; passengers from station to station, on an orb that
  whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess cannot be exclusive;
  they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights of others. Just as the
  passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and his baggage over as many
  seats as he pleases, until other passengers come in, so may a settler take
  and use as much land as he chooses, until it is needed by others &#8212; a
  fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when his right must
  be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation
  can give a right which will bar these equal rights of others. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. <strong>No citizen will have an advantage over
  any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
  and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns.</strong> Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>WHAT the people of England are entitled to by natural right, and what we
    propose by the single tax to take for their use, is the value of land <span style="font-style: italic;">as
    it is</span>, exclusive of the value or improvements <span style="font-style: italic;">as
    they are</span> in or on the land privately owned. What would thus be left
    to the landowners would be their personal or moveable property, the value
    of all existing improvements in or on their land, and their equal share with
    all other citizens in the land value resumed. This is perfectly clear, and
    if not perfectly fair, is only so because it would leave to the landowners
    in their personal property and the value of their improvements much not due
    to any exertion of labor by themselves or their ancestors, but which has
    come to them through the unjust appropriation of the proceeds of others'
    labor. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C08_Justice_on_the_Right_to_Land.htm">A

      FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q26. Hasn't every man who needs it a right to be employed by the government?</em><br>
    A. No. But he has a right to have government secure him in the enjoyment
      of his equal right to the opportunities for employment that nature and
      social growth supply. When government secures him in that respect, if he
      cannot get work it is because (1) he does not offer the kind of service
      that people want; or (2) he is incapable. His remedy, if he does not offer
      the kind of service that people want, is either to make people see that
      they are mistaken, or go to work at something else; if he is incapable,
      his remedy is to improve himself. In no case has he a right to government
      interference in his behalf, either through schemes to make work, or by
      bounties or tariffs.</p>
  <p><em>Q53. Is it true that men are equally entitled to land? Are they not
      entitled to it in proportion to their use of it?</em><br>
A. Yes, they are entitled to it in proportion to their use of it and it is this
title that the single tax would secure. It would allow every one to possess as
much land as he wished, upon the sole condition that if it has a value he shall
account to the community for that value and for nothing else; all that he produces
from the land above its value being absolutely his, free even from taxation.
The single tax is the method best adapted to our circumstances, and to orderly
conditions, for limiting possession of land to its use. By making it unprofitable
to hold land except for use, or to hold more than can be used to advantage, it
constitutes every man his own judge of the amount and the character of the land
that he can use. </p>
  <p><em>Q58. Should not the poor man be compensated for the loss of his land
      value?</em><br>
A. No. The reasons are numerous. Among them are the following: The poor man's
rights in the community and in common property are neither more nor less than
the rich man's. The better conditions for the poor man which the single tax would
bring about would more than off-set his loss in land values. The poor man has
no land values worth speaking of. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

        Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend. ...</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city
    very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have
    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely
    to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the public
    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land
    by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom
    resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  <br>
&#8220;God gave the world to men in common; but since He gave it for their benefit

  cannot be supposed He meant it should always remain common and uncultivated.
  He gave it to the use of the industrious and rational (and labour was to be his

  Ogilvie: &#8220;Nor yet that it should be appropriated in such a manner as that,
  when not more than half cultivated, the farther cultivation and improvement should
  be stopped short, and the industry of millions willing to employ themselves in
  rendering the earth more fertile should be excluded from its proper field, and
  denied any parcel of the soil, on which it could be exercised, with security
  of reaping its full
  produce and just reward.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;This title to an equal share of
  property in land&#8221; is declared by Professor Ogilvie to be a &#8220;BIRTHRIGHT

&#8220;These rights are denied when the equal right to land - on which and by

<p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
    Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out of
    the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor products.
    Let us see. </p>
  <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
    of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor produces
    on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the most, and
    D's is the least, productive land in use in the community to which they belong.
    B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose each occupies the best
    land that was open to him when he entered into possession. Now, B, and C,
    and D have just as good a right to the use of the best land as A had. </p>
  <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality of
    opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results, all other
    things being equal except the land. </p>
  <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
    must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages
    accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that which falls to
    the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </p>
  <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what it should
    produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage of natural
    opportunity over D. </p>
  <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
    for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a well, making
    a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </p>
  <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
    fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products (though
    paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they enjoy over
    D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
  <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the best
    land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use
    he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage with the
    rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him, in proportion
    to their respective advantages, those public utilities which invariably arise
    wherever men live in communities. Of course he will in turn hold to those
    who come later the same relation that those who came earlier held to him. </p>
  <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead of land;
    all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is to produce
    little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using it himself
    nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this, for he would grab
    to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold of. Each of the others
    would do the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by, E, F and
    G would find no land left for them on which they might make a living. </p>
  <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
    the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the devil
    of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice, freedom,
    social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent, consuming
    grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime breeding,
    want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
  <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor products
    in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat on the bovine
    stupidity of the community that contributes its own land values toward its
    own enslavement! </p>
  <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
  <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
    difference. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
    <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
    <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously damnable
      difference; </li>
    <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding their
      families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would yield them
      abundance on the other. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance, and if it
    does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able to draw his robe close
    around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's none of my fault;
    I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

      Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective
      -- the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed
      measure: the guaranteed income. ...</p>
  <p>The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full
      employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one
      method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned
      that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that
      enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional
      jobs are not available. ...</p>
  <p>Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income
      operates as a consistently progressive measure.</p>
  <p> * First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest
      levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate
      welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions.<br>
      * Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase
      as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under
      growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic
      reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed
      income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these
      safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security
      and stability.</p>
  <p>This proposal is not a &quot;civil rights&quot; program, in the sense that
      that term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including
      the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white
    will act in coalition to effect this change, because their combined strength
    will
      be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</p>
  <p>Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we
      realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already
      been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused
      social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest.
      The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their
      polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule,
      through welfare benefits.</p>
  <p>John Kenneth Galbraith has estimated that $20 billion a year would effect
      a guaranteed income, which he describes as &quot;not much more than we
      will spend the next fiscal year to rescue freedom and democracy and religious
      liberty
      as these are defined by 'experts' in Vietnam.&quot;</p>
  <p>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity,
      which has vanished, and to compress our abundance into the overfed mouths of
      the middle and upper classes until they gag with superfluity. If democracy
      is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this inequity. It
      is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading
      human life by clinging to archaic thinking.</p>
  <p>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel
      and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when
      men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil
      or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us
      to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.

<blockquote>
  <p>      Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city, state
        or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing with
        the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
        expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.
      <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
    one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded on
    the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural assets,
    it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and income rights.
    It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons equally, but
    everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from selling limited
    usage rights.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
    Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
      of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent Fund shows, it&#8217;s
      possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</p>
  <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on liquidity,
    but also on attention. People would notice common property if they got income
    from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it, and talk about it. Concern
    for invisible commons would soar.</p>
  <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since common
    property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable the way
    corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t reap capital
    gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income stakes throughout
    their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent, royalties, interest,

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    The Idea of Birthrights</p>
  <p>John Locke&#8217;s response to royalty&#8217;s claim of divine right was
    the idea of everyone&#8217;s inherent right to <em><strong>life, liberty, and
    property</strong></em>.
    Thomas Jefferson, in drafting America&#8217;s Declaration of Independence,
    changed Locke&#8217;s trinity to<em><strong> life, liberty, and the pursuit of
    happiness</strong></em>.
    These, Jefferson and his collaborators agreed, are gifts from the creator
    that can&#8217;t be taken away. Put slightly differently, they&#8217;re <em><strong>universal
    birthrights</strong></em>.</p>
  <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant bones. They
    guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process, habeas corpus, speedy
    public trials, and secure homes and property. Wisely, the Ninth Amendment
    affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
    shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#8221; In
    that spirit, others have since been added.</p>
  <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
    see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against the state.
    The second included rights against unequal treatment based on race, nationality,
    gender, or sexual orientation. The third wave &#8212; which, historically
    speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists of rights not <em>against</em> things,
    but <em>for</em> things &#8212; free public education, collective bargaining for wages,
    security in old age. They can be thought of as rights necessary for the pursuit
    of happiness.</p>
  <p>What makes this latest wave of birthrights strengthen community is their
    universality. If some Americans could enjoy free public education while others
    couldn&#8217;t, the resulting inequities would divide rather than unite us
    as a nation. The universality of these rights puts everyone in the same boat.
    It spreads risk, responsibility, opportunity, and reward across race, gender,
    economic classes, and generations. It makes us a nation rather than a collection
    of isolated individuals.</p>
  <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from the corporate
    sector. The starting condition for the corporate sector, as we&#8217;ve seen,
    is that the top 5 percent owns more shares than everyone else. The starting
    condition for the commons sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property.</p>
  <p>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers, distinguished
    between <em><strong>pre</strong></em> distribution of property and <em><strong>re</strong></em> distribution of income. Under
    income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and transferred
    to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t popular with winners,
    who tend to control government and the media. Under property <em><strong>pre </strong></em>distribution,
    by contrast, the playing field is leveled by spreading property ownership
    before income is generated. After that, there&#8217;s no need for income
    redistribution; property itself distributes income to all. According to Rawls,
    while income re distribution creates dependency, property predistribution
    empowers.</p>
  <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property from some
    and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth that
    already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing) some of
    that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons, we <em><strong>need</strong></em>    to
    propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth now. This twenty-first
    century necessity means we have a chance to save the planet, and as a bonus,
    add a universal birthright. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
