<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p>Our young people face tremendous
      barriers to entry.&nbsp; Houses require large downpayments and/or large
      mortgage payments.&nbsp; Budding entrepreneurs need good locations to
      work their business plans, but rents are prohibitively high.&nbsp; And
      in addition to the mortgage or rent payment, they still owe taxes on
      their income and on many of their purchases.&nbsp; The underlying cause
      of the high housing prices and high commercial property rents is
      something few of us think about, but it is rather straightforward, and,
      fortunately, easy to reverse. <br>
      <br>
      California, with its Proposition 13, is a particularly serious case,
      both for those who seek to buy homes and for those who would open a
      business. &nbsp; But the same situation occurs in most cities.&nbsp; It
      is not a new phenomenon: Henry George saw it in his travels in San
      Francisco, New York City and elsewhere,130 years ago.&nbsp; Why has it
      taken the rest of us so long to recognize its causes and agitate for change?      </p>
      <p>Not only must our young people pay huge amounts for property, but in
        California they pay property taxes that are large multiples of what
        their long-owning neighbors are asked to pay.   Is this any way to run
        a society of equals?</p>
      <p>Similarly, our potential entrepreneurs, of all ages, seeking to live
        out the portion of the American dream that involves opening one's own
        business, also face high barriers to entry, unless their business plan
        can be carried out with no location other than a desk in their bedroom.
        The high price of land is probably the largest barrier to entry. This
        means that our existing businesses, large and small, have fewer competitors,
        keeping wages low and prices high. Who wins in this situation? He who
        has the land, of course! How do we correct it? Collect the economic value
        of the land from those who hold it, on the basis that it is our common
        treasure, not the product of the private effort of its current
        owner (individual or corporate). </p>

                  to substitute one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>)
                  for all other taxes, as a discovery equal in utility to the invention

                  natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also
                  a natural reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all
                  for each. No one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than
                  he can keep the bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return
                  to those who undertake it, yields collateral advantages to others. If
                  a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its
                  time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain to the
                  whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
                  supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain
                  which it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to
                  the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty.
                  And so with everything else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship,
                  or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the direct profits.</p>

          <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
                  him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of
                  his labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the
                  more that labor and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth
                  in which all may share. And in the value or rent of land is this general
                  gain expressed in a definite and concrete form. Here is a fund which
                  the state may take while leaving to labor and capital their full reward.
                  With increased activity of production this would commensurately increase.</p>

                  the production of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For
                  under this system no one would care to hold land unless to use it, and
                  land now withheld from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>

                  would be abandoned by their present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal

            <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land
                          cannot be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by
                          all competent economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons
                          untrained in economics. The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is
                          that it cannot limit the supply of land. Landowners are presumably,
                          before the tax is laid, charging all the rent they can get. There
                          is nothing in a tax on the rental value of land to make tenants willing
                          to pay more or to make land more difficult to hire. On the contrary,
                          more land will be on the market, because of such a tax, rather than
                          less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding land out of use
                          and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of former vacant
                          land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper to
                          rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
                          after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land
                          will be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>

          <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural

                  as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford
                  to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand

                                economists, have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension
                                of this point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced
                                that the greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor
                                man who is trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece
                                of land; for, it is said, the higher taxes on the land after
                                it is acquired, offset the lower purchase price. What such objectors
                                do not see is that even if the lower price of land does no more
                                than balance the higher tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one
                                thing, the discouragement to speculation in land), the reduction
                                or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to
                                save in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of
                                taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling price
                                is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                                its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be
                                fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase
                                price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on
                                buildings and other improvements and in whatever other taxes
                                are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>

          <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon
            the labor market. Competition would no longer be one-sided, as now.
            Instead of laborers competing with
                    each other for employment, and in their competition cutting
            down wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere
            be competing
                    for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of
            labor. For into the labor market would have entered the greatest
            of all competitors
                    for the employment of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot

                                as laborers or capitalists, or both. And further consideration
                                will show that though the large landholders may lose relatively,
                                yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For, the
                                increase in production will be so great that labor and capital
                                will gain very much more than will be lost to private landownership,
                                while in these gains, and in the greater ones involved in a more
                                healthy social condition, the whole community, including the
                              landowners themselves, will share.</div>

        <div style="text-align: left;">Take, now, the case of the homestead owner
          -- the mechanic, storekeeper, or professional man who has secured himself
          a house
                          and lot, where he lives, and which he contemplates
          with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot be ejected
          in case of
                          his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary,
          he will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish --
          theoretically
                          it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him
          will not disappear. It will serve his purpose as well as ever. While,
                          as the value of all other lots will diminish or disappear
          in
                          the same ratio, he retains the same security of always
          having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
                          as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may
          be said
                          to be a loser by a subsequent fall in the price of
          boots. His boots will be just as useful to him, and the next pair of
          boots
                          he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead owner, his
          lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a larger
                          lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads
                          of their own, he will, even in the matter of lots,
          be the gainer.
                          And in the present, other things considered, he will
          be much the gainer. For though he will have more taxes to pay upon
          his
                          land, he will be released from taxes upon his house
          and improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all
          that he and
                          his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings
          will be largely increased by the rise of wages, the constant employment,
          and
                          the increased briskness of trade. His only loss will
          be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting another, and this will
                        be a small loss compared with the great gain. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole

                </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even if universal history did
              not teach the lesson, it is in the
              United States already becoming very evident that political equality
              can continue to exist only upon a basis of social equality; that
              where the disparity in the distribution of wealth increases,
              political democracy only makes easier the concentration of power, and
              must inevitably lead to tyranny and anarchy. And it is already
              evident that there is nothing in political democracy, nothing in
              popular education, nothing in any of our American institutions, to
              prevent the most enormous disparity in the distribution of wealth.
              Nowhere in the world are such great fortunes growing up as in the
              United States. Considering that the average income of the working
              masses of our people is only a few hundred dollars a year, a fortune
              of a million dollars is a monstrous thing &#8211; a more monstrous and
              dangerous thing under a democratic government than anywhere else. Yet
              fortunes of ten and twelve million dollars are with us ceasing to be
              noticeable. We already have citizens whose wealth can be estimated
              only in hundreds of millions, and before the end of the century, if
              present tendencies continue, we are likely to have fortunes estimated
              in thousands of millions &#8211; such monstrous fortunes as the world
              has never seen since the growth of similar fortunes ate out the heart
              of Rome. And the necessary correlative of the growth of such fortunes
              is the impoverishment and loss of independence on the part of the
              masses. These great aggregations of wealth are like great trees,
              which strike deep roots and spread wide branches, and which, by
              sucking up the moisture from the soil and intercepting the sunshine,
              stunt and kill the vegetation around them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a capital of a
              million dollars comes into competition with capitals of thousands of
              dollars, the smaller capitalists must be driven out of the business
              or destroyed.</span> With great capital nothing can compete save great
              capital. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hence, every aggregation of
              wealth increases the tendency to
              the aggregation of wealth, and decreases the possibility of the
              employee ever becoming more than an employee, compelling him to
              compete with his fellows as to who will work cheapest for the great
              capitalist &#8211; a competition that can have but one result, that of
              forcing wages to the minimum at which the supply of labor can be kept
              up.</span> Where we are is not so important as in what direction we are
              going, and in the United States all tendencies are clearly in this
              direction. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A while ago, and any
              journeyman shoemaker could set up in
              business for himself with the savings of a few months. But now the
              operative shoemaker could not in a lifetime save enough from his
              wages to go into business for himself. </span>And, now that great
              capital
              has entered agriculture, it must be with the same results. The large
              farmer, who can buy the latest machinery at the lowest cash prices
              and use it to the best advantage, who can run a straight furrow for
              miles, who can make special rates with railroad companies, take
              advantage of the market, and sell in large lots for the least
              commission, must drive out the small farmer of the early American
              type just as the shoe factory has driven out the journeyman
          shoemaker. And this is going on today.</small>    <small>... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

 href="../HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html">Why The Landowner
            Cannot Shift The Tax on Land Values</a> (1887)<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"><br>
            </a>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A VERY common objection to the
              proposition to concentrate all taxes on Land Values is that the
              landowner would add the increased tax on the value of his land to the
              rent that must be paid by his tenants. It is this notion that increased
              Taxation of Land Values would fall upon the users, not upon the owners
              of land, that more perhaps than anything else prevents men from seeing
              the far-reaching and beneficent effects of doing away with the taxes
              that now fall upon labor or the products of labor, and taking for
              public use those values that attach to land by reason of the growth and
              progress of society. </small><br>
            <br>
            <small>That taxes levied upon Land Values, or, to use the
              politico-economic term, taxes levied upon rent, do not fall upon the
              user of land, and cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant
              is conceded by all economists of reputation. However much they may
              dispute as to other things, there is no dispute upon this point.
              Whatever flimsy reasons any of them may have deemed it expedient to
              give why the tax on rent should not be more resorted to, they all admit
              that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the taxation of rent merely
              diminishes the profits of the landowner, cannot be shifted on the user
            of land, cannot add to prices, nor check production.</span> <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
            </strong><br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But while the Taxation of Land
              Values cannot raise rents, it would, especially in a country like this,
              where there is so much valuable land unused, tend strongly to lower
              them.</span> In all our cities, and through all the country, there is
              much land which is not used, or not put to its best use, because it is
              held at high prices by men who do not want to, or who cannot, use it
              themselves, but who are holding it in expectation of profiting by the
              increased value which the growth of population will give to it in the
              future. Now the effect of the Taxation of Land Values would be to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">compel these men to seek tenants or
              purchasers.</span> Land upon which there is no taxation even a poor man
              can easily hold for higher prices, for land eats nothing. But put heavy
              taxation upon it, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">even a rich man
              will be driven to seek purchasers or tenants, and to get them he will
              have to put down the price he asks, instead of putting it up; for it is
              by asking less, not by asking more, that those who have anything they
              are forced to dispose of must seek customers.</span> Rather than
              continue to pay heavy taxes upon land yielding him nothing, and from
              the future increase in value of which he could have no expectation of
              profit, since increase in value would mean increased taxes, he would be
              glad to give it away or let it revert to the State. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the dogs in the manger, who all over
              the country are withholding land that they cannot use themselves from
              men who would be glad to use it, would be forced to let go their grasp.</span>
            To tax Land Values up to anything like their full amount would be to
              utterly destroy speculative values, and to diminish all rents into
          which this speculative element enters.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small>    </div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> To put the matter in a form in
              which it can be easily
              understood, let us take two cases. 
          </small></p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>The one, a country where the
            available land is all in use, and the competition of tenants has
            carried rents to a point at which the tenant pays the landlord all he
            can possibly earn save just enough to barely live. 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>The other, a
            country where all the available land is not in use and the rent that
            the landlord can get from the tenant is limited by the terms on which
            the tenant can get access to unused land. How, in either case, if the
            tax were imposed upon Land Values (or rent), could the landlord
            compel the tenant to pay it? ....</small></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Hence a tax on Land Values,
              instead of enabling the holder of
              land to charge that much more for his land, gives him no power to
              charge an additional penny. On the contrary, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">by making it more costly
              to hold land idle, it tends to increase the amount of land which
              owners must strive to secure tenants or purchasers for. Thus
              the effect of a tax on Land Values is not to increase the rent that
              the tenant must pay the owner for the use of the land, but rather to
              reduce it. </span>And since the tax must be paid out of what the land
              will
              yield the owner, its effect would be to reduce the price for which
          the land could be sold outright. </small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here, let us say, is a lot on the
              principal select street of a
              city having an annual or rental value of $10,000. Such a lot would
              now command a selling price of some $250,000. An increased tax upon
              Land Values would not reduce its rental value, except as it might
              have an effect in forcing into use unoccupied land at a greater
              distance from the center of the city. But as less of this rental
              value could be retained by the owner, the selling price would be
              diminished. And if a tax on Land Values could be imposed with such
              theoretical perfection that the whole rental value would be taken by
              the community, the owner would lose both his income from its present
              value and any expectation of profit from its future increase in
              value. While it would be still worth as much as before to the user,
              it would be worth nothing at all to the mere owner. Instead of having
              a selling value of $250,000, it would not sell for anything, since
              what the user paid for the privilege of using it would go in full to
              the community. Under a tax of this kind, even though it could not be
              imposed with theoretical nicety, the mere owner of land would
              disappear. No one would care to own land unless he wanted to improve
              or use it.

                  honestly and well would be the rich man, and he who did not work
                  would be poor. We have so reversed the order of nature that we are

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And if you trace it out I believe
                you will see that the primary cause of this is that we compel those
                who work to pay others for permission to do so. You may buy a coat,
                a horse, a house; there you are paying the seller for labour exerted,
                for something that he has produced, or that he has got from the man
                who did produce it; but when you pay a man for land, what are you paying
                him for? You are paying for something that no man has produced; you
                pay him for something that was here before man was, or for a value
                that was created, not by him individually, but by the community of
                which you are a part. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the
                reason that the land here, where we stand tonight, is worth more than
                it was twenty-five years ago? What is the reason that land in the centre
                of New York, that once could be bought by the mile for a jug of whiskey,
                is now worth so much that, though you were to cover it with gold, you
                would not have its value? Is it not because of the increase of population?</span> Take
                away that population, and where would the value of the land be? Look
          at it in any way you please.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, supposing we should abolish
                all other taxes direct and indirect, substituting for them a tax upon
          land values, what would be the effect? </small></p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>In the first place it would be to kill speculative values.
                  It would be to remove from the newer parts of the country the bulk
                  of the taxation and put it on the richer parts. It would be to exempt
                  the pioneer from taxation and make the larger cities pay more of
                  it. It would be to relieve energy and enterprise, capital and labour,
                  from all those burdens that now bear upon them. What a start that

              over-production. How can there be such a thing as
              over-production while people want? All these things that are said to
              be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
              them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
              them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
              buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
              work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
              quantities of goods cannot be sold. Now why is it that men have to work
              for such low wages? Because
              if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
              men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
              men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
              point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
              get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
              men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
              employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
          was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>

              why cannot they employ

 style="font-weight: bold;">Men are compelled to compete
              with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been

            round the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
            in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his

              suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
              under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
              consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
              measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
              already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
              town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
              rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
              the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
              daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
              Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
              admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of the land monopolist
              as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
              example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not take that view of
              the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dog-in-the-manger</span>
            game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
              the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
              or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
              we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
              -- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
              yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
              property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
              It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
              which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
              still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
              the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
              proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
              such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
              than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
              fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with

          <blockquote>
            <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
                an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use
            the word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
            <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He
                  needs a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this
                  new building on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what
                  he wants, and the real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just
                  right for his needs. The man asks the agent, "All right, now how much
                  money do you want for this land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The
                  man says, "Why is it worth $50,000?" And the real estate agent points
                  out that "The school is good, the roads are good, the police department
                  is good, the rescue crew is good and very fast, and business is good
              here." </p>
              <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price.
                  I'll take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the
                  road people, and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And
                  the real estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay
              it to the person who owned the land before."</p>
              <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the
                  police, and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
              build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
              <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for
                  me for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
              at all!&quot;</p>

        a developer to begin housing construction. In New Jersey, that interval

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Abstract<br>
            </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are
            resented by the large proportion of our population. We could replace
            all taxes on wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent.
            Rent is windfall income; it is income that arises not from the efforts
            of any person or corporation; it comes about as a surplus gain from
            common social enterprise. There is ample moral warrant for society
            to lay claim to that which it has created, as well as to that which
            no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly makes clear
            that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official government
            figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant all
            current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are
            acknowledged to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic
            rent in all its manifestations by taxing its various bases actually
            can foster economic performance and yield other benefits that make
            it the natural source of revenue for governments. Such a tax is essentially
            painless. ...</p>
          <p><strong>The Possibility of Land (Rent) Taxation</strong></p>
          <p>The key to understanding how taxing various forms of land conform
            to sound tax theory comes with an appreciation of the importance
            of economic rent. Largely discarded in 20th century economic analysis,
            rent is the price for the use of land. Just as the price of labor
            is paid in wages and the price of capital is paid in interest, land
            rent is the unearned increment that attaches to land in the form
            of a surplus when its price is not paid by its users. All taxes,
            ultimately, come out of rent; however, by collecting revenue from
            other sources, the rent is left to settle in ever increasing encrustations
            on land sites, i.e., capitalized, ultimately raising their market
            price. In so doing, these land prices are distorted so that their
            optimal use is not secured.</p>
          <p>Examples of such distortion are not difficult to identify. <strong>Consider,
            first of all, the use of locations in our urban environments, many
            of which are underused while prospective entrepreneurs are driven
            to second-best locations because titleholders opt to let the rent
            accrete and passively raise their market price. Land speculation
            is rife most of all in instances where there is a great disparity
            between the tax rate on these sites and the rate of rent appreciation. </strong>When
            the holding costs of ownership are nominal, there is no incentive
            for improving them or selling to others who will, and urban environments
            suffer as a result. Another example is rent that collects to the
            electromagnetic spectrum, making it attractive for owners of electronic
            media, communications networks and so on, to rely on returns to their
            investments even when the resource itself is sparsely used. So also
            with the time slots for take-offs and landings at airports. These
            opportunities are respected as private property, even while they

          Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Making Housing
          Affordable</b>
          </small><br>
          <small>The implementation of our ideas would have a dramatic effect in
          making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
          costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
          enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
        accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
          recent years, which have made it
          nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
          have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
        down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held
          off the market by speculators who may wait generations do decide to
          develop it.</span> The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether
          used or not, equal to the rental value of the land, will induce
          speculators to either develop this land themselves or turn it over to
          someone who will.</small></li>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
          cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
          low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
          introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
          not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
          their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
          the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
          which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
          could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
          restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who
          wishes to own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying
          the title to the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of
          the house itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a
          fee equal to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of
          land titles became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a
          family would have to borrow to purchase a house would fall. ...&nbsp; <a

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While taxes on labour
and
capital act as a deterrent to production and employment, the unique
qualities of land are such that a tax on land values encourages land to
be put to its optimal use. Simply put, land holders cannot afford to
hold land unused or underused, for they are compelled to pay the full
LVT whether they use this scarce resource or not. </span>The resulting
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compact cityscape</span>
would consume far less resources (in terms of land, infrastructure and
ongoing energy costs) and would be more amenable to the provision of
public transport, walking and riding.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Note that advocates of LVT, often nowadays called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Geoists</span>,
call for the full collection of the LVT and not the partial and
misapplied (with all manner of exemptions and thresholds) forms
collected by some local, state and federal governments in Australia and
elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When the land occupier is
repaying his/her full dues (which is only just, as they represent the
value of the amenities of the land), then land will have no market
price. </span>The improvements on the land (buildings etc.) retain
their market value as they are not being taxed, so production is not
penalised or discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The social
justice implications of having land with no market price (i.e. all
humanity having their very birthright) are profound, but are again
outside the domain of this paper. ... </span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE FREE LUNCH: </b><b>Its
cost to citizens</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b>The recycling of savings into new mortgage lending has fueled an
economy-wide inflation of asset prices for land, homes, and commercial
properties, as well as stock market and bond prices. If what rises in
value is mainly the land site, then the property owners appear as
passive beneficiaries enjoying a free lunch. The property is their
major asset and the mortgage their major debt. While doing little to
increase the value of the building beyond having picked a good location
and making the normal maintenance, they ride the crest of asset-price
inflation of land . Indeed, take-home earnings have drifted down over
the past two decades, but house prices have soared. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These "capital gains" for
households are part of the new phenomenon that has been popularized as
"labor capitalism." As Margaret Thatcher's crowd has put it, "Sorry
you've lost your job; I hope you've made a killing on your Council
House or home in the real estate market." The free lunch.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
the two-thirds of America's and Britain's populations who are home
owners, this free lunch from asset-price inflation of land has proved
to be a silver lining in the post-industrial economy. For the remaining
third of the population, however, the price of access to home ownership
is receding rapidly. Today it hardly is possible for most renters to
earn the money to acquire their own homes. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The entry price has been bid up
too high by those hoping to gain from asset-price inflation even as
labor's earnings have been declining.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Its cost to the
economy</b><br>
Once a building has taken all its depreciation, investors have a tax
motive to sell the property and buy another. The sales price obviously
will be higher if the new buyer can begin depreciating the building all
over again, for the property will yield more after-tax revenue. This
financial trick turns the real estate sector into a game of musical
chairs, while enabling property owners to avoid income taxation. The
end result is to free more of their cash flow to pledge to mortgage
lenders as interest, in exchange for loans to buy more and more
property that is rising in price. This is the anatomy of the dramatic
increase in land-prices, called the real estate bubble. The tragedy of
modern economies is this divergence of saving away from financing new
direct investment and employment, to inflate a financial and real
estate bubble. When the bubble bursts there will be little new tangible
wealth creation to show for it, only a wave of insolvency, bankruptcy
and foreclosures as the Western economies begin to look more like that
of Japan since its bubble burst a decade ago. America's and Europe's
largest economic expansion may similarly give way to a long depression.
Its cause will remain invisible as long as the politically powerful
real estate interests keep getting land undevalued and its income
masked as capital gains on the national income and product accounts

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<small>... Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.

</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RBPTatCFLO.html"><small>The Relationship Between Property Taxation and the
Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real
wage rates, meanwhile since 1955, have not risen as fast as
real land prices, and they haven't risen at all since 1975. </span>This
has
raised the labor-price of land (the number of days/years a person must
work at the average wage
rate in order to raise the price of a farm.)&nbsp; Coupling this with
rising acres per farm, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
labor-price of a farm roughly tripled, from about 6 years' wages
(before payroll deductions) in 1954 to about 17 years' wages in 1987</span>.
That, of course, doesn't mean you could buy a farm in 17 years, unless
you didn't eat
anything and saved every penny of your wages to buy a farm.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1900 the Census Bureau began publishing farm data ranked by
acres per farm. Using those data, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Gini Ratio was .58 in 1900.</span> By
1930 the GR had gotten up only to .63. This, remember, was the peak
year of property
taxes, before the property tax started waning. The GR began to rise
faster, and by 1950 it was up to .70. It plateaued there for 15 years
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">then rose again to .76
by 1987</span>. That is a high degree of concentration. (By comparison,
GRs
for personal income are much lower, about .40, and are much more stable
over decades.) The
accelerated rise since 1930 coincided with the rise of mean acres per
farm, and both followed the fall of property tax rates.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Gini Ratio has been criticized because it deals only with
the
concentration among existing farms, and doesn't take into account all
of the former farmers who left the business. To adjust for this, we can
simply add them
to the distribution of the farms as farmers with zero land. There are
4-1/2 million farms that died between 1935 and 1988. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you add in the farmers with zero
acres of land to the lowest bracket, that raises GR for 1988 from .76
to .92</span>, a radical rise of inequality since 1930 (.63). But
calculating the ratio this way
gives you a better sense of how concentration has shot up during and
since the Great Depression. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the
Great Depression (1930-1941), six million farms provided a
refuge for the urban jobless and homeless. Today, that refuge is
closed.</span> </small></div>

CONCLUSION
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span

land means control over water. Control of water gives control over

become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior wealth can no longer buy in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared

is harder for a newcomer to acquire any farm acres.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been pulled up.
Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987

<b>Concentration of

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small><font
 size="-2"></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. </small><small><a

Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders

exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with

Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small><br>

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
applied these inherent differences
between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
reduce the price of land." </small><br>
<br>
<small>Here, then is another derivative difference between land and
products, according to George: taxation on products causes an
increase in the price of products; taxation on the value of land
causes a drop in the price of land.&nbsp; ... <a

    of Land Value Taxation to Problems of Environmental Protection, Congestion,
    Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation generalizes into the principle that people should pay
      for all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to the
      opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting revenue should
      be shared equally. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxing land has an additional effect that increases the stock of capital.
      A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults to the young and
      unborn, who will now be born with rights to land. Unless there is a perfectly
      offsetting reduction in the desire to accumulate assets to transfer to the
      next generation, this redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer
      assets, to accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
      is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</p>
  <p>Taxing land also increases the efficiency with which land is used. This occurs
      through three paths.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land speculation, and therefore
          reduces the quantity of land speculation. </li>
    <li>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling price of land,
          the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the annual tax)
      for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land relatively more
      attractive
          to bidders with high discount rates and relatively less attractive
      to bidders with low discount rates. To the extent that the former are more
      entrepreneurial
          and the latter more passive investors, land will tend to flow into
      the hands of persons who will choose to use it more intensively. </li>
    <li>The third path by which a tax on land increases the efficiency with which
          land is used is that, for those who are using land inefficiently, it
      substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an implicit one (the income
      foregone by inefficient
          use). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Psychologically, explicit costs tend to be more effective in motivating efficient
      behavior than implicit ones. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to understand how closely linked transportation costs and
      land costs are. There are fixed costs involved in locating a home or a business
      in either place: the costs of building a home, office, or factory and the costs
      of purchasing a car or a truck. Leaving those costs aside for the moment, consider
      the relationship between the variable operating costs due to locating in an
      urban center versus those in locating at the periphery ... </p>
  <p>Figure 10.1 shows that a household or business is likely to incur costs by
      locating at either site, whether at a city's center or at the city's edge.
      At a center site, the costs will take the form of higher land rent; at the
      city's edge, the costs will be transportation related. If this is not readily
      apparent, it is because society provides subsidies to titleholders and travelers
