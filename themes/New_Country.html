  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought
          this question:</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">&quot;Suppose there should arise
      from the English Channel or the German Ocean a no man's land on which common
      labor to an unlimited amount should
          be able to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated
          and of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large
      a part of English soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon
          increase to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
          would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall;
      and if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would
      happen
          without any very large part of English labor being diverted to the
      new natural opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being
      much
      changed;
          only that kind of production being abandoned which now yields to labor
      and to landlord together less than labor could secure on the new opportunities.
          The great rise in wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>

          years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the
          electric
          light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements
          that
          so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years,
          interest be any higher?&quot;</p>

  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">

      labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">He will tell you, &quot;No; the
      wages of common labor will not be any higher; on the contrary, all the
      chances are that they will be lower; it will not

   Land Question</a> (1881)<a

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean;
imagine a little world swimming
in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
primitive, this will work well enough.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turn away the eyes of the mind for
a moment, let time pass, and
look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
even supposing there have been no important inventions or
improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
During this time some of these people will have been careless,
generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
produced poverty and virtual slavery.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For the people we have supposed
are human beings &#8211; that is to
say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
everything as he wills.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, however, the concentration of
landownership has not gone so
far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
competition between them as well as between those who have only their
labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But let us introduce another
element into the supposition. Let us
suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Manifestly, the effect of all such
discoveries and inventions is
to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
dependent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, since we are imagining
conditions, imagine laborsaving
inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
the landowners!&nbsp; ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Now, rent is a natural and
just thing. For instance,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if
we in this
room were to go together to a new country and we were to agree that
we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we
divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue
equality?</span> If it were proposed that we should divide it up into
equal
pieces, there would be in the first place this objection, that in our
division we would not fully know the character of the land; one man
would get a more valuable piece than the other. Then as time passed
the value of different pieces of land would change, and further than
that if we were once to make a division and then allow full and
absolute ownership of the land, inequality would come up in the
succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another man, on
the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one man
would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
little while many of these people would have parted with their land
to others, so that their children coming after them into the world
would have no land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The only fair way
would be this-- that any man
among us should be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use
it, that no one else wanted to use; that where more than one man
wanted to use the same piece of land, the man who did use it should
pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being used for the
benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. That
would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE problem is how to apply that
to an old country. True we are
confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. Now one
of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for
the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I
do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
that time a most important <b>third way</b>, and that is the way we
advocate.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what
we call the single tax. We
propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone -- not
upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
a house. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that rent is a natural
thing. So it is. Where one man, all
rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than
another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the
difference. Where one man has a piece of land and others have none,
it gives him a special advantage; it is only fair that he should pay
into the common fund the value of that special privilege granted him
by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BUT over and above the economic
rent there is the power that comes
by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
called <b>monopoly rent</b>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On
this island</span> that I have supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
But if one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then 1 could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>WHAT I ask you here tonight is as far as you can to join in this
general movement and push on the cause. It is not a local matter, it
is a worldwide matter. It is not a matter than interests merely the
people of Ireland, the people of England and Scotland or of any other
country in particular, but it is a matter that interests the whole
world. What we are battling for is the freedom of mankind; what we
are struggling for is for the abolition of that industrial slavery
which as mud enslaves men as did chattel slavery. It will not take
the sword to win it. There is a power far stronger than the sword and
that is the power of public opinion. When the masses of men know what
hurts them and how it can be cured when they know what to demand, and
to make their demand heard and felt, they will have it and no power
on earth can prevent them What enslaves men everywhere is ignorance
and prejudice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we were to go to that island
that we imagined, and if you were
fools enough to admit that the land belonged to me, I would be your
master, and you would be my slaves just as thoroughly, just as
completely, as if I owned your bodies, for all I would have to do to
send you out of existence would be to say to you "get off my
property." That is the cause of the industrial slavery that exists
all over the world, that is the cause of the low wages, that is the
cause of the unemployed labor. ...&nbsp; <a

impossible. Equality could not be secured in that way, nor could it
be maintained. The ideal way, the way which wise men, desirous of
according to each his equal right, would resort to in a new country,
would be to treat the land as the property of the whole, to allow
individuals to possess and to use it, paying for the whole a proper
rent for any superiority in the piece of land they were using.
(Hear.) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ideal plan would allow every
man who wished to use land to
obtain it, and to possess what he wished to use so long as no one
else wished to use it, and if the land be so superior that more than
one wanted to use it, a proper payment according to its superiority
should be made to the community, and by that community used for the
common benefit. (Hear, hear.) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether it would be better
wherever circumstances change, to
change the rent every year; whether it would be better to secure
payment at a fixed rent for a certain time; there may be some
differences of opinion. In my opinion it would be better to adopt a
flexible system which would allow a change every year.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now if that were done, if the
land were let out, those using it
paying its premium value to the community, it would amount to
precisely the same thing if, instead of calling the payment rent, we
called it taxes. &#8220;A rose by any other name would smell as
sweet.&#8221; In an old country, however, there is a very great
advantage in calling the rent a tax. In an old country there is a
very great advantage in moving on that line. People are used to the
payment of taxes. They are not used to the formal ownership of land
by the community; and to the letting of it out in that way.
Therefore, as society is now constituted, and in our communities as
they now exist, we propose to move towards our ideal along the line
of taxation. (Hear, hear.)&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

    American</a></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p>While he was working at the case, too, there happened one
      of those trivial incidents that turn out to be important in setting the
      course of one&#8217;s
        life. He heard an old printer say that in a new country wages are always high,
        while in an old country they are always low. George was struck by this remark
        and on thinking it over, he saw that it was true. Wages were certainly higher
        in the United States than in Europe, and he remembered that they were higher
        in Australia than in England. More than this, they were higher in the newer
        parts than in the older parts of the same country &#8212; higher in Oregon
        and California, for instance, than in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>George used to say that this was the first little puzzle
      in political economy that ever came his way. He did not give it any thought
      until long after; in
        fact, he says he did not begin to think intently on any economic subject
      until conditions in California turned his mind that way. When finally he
      did so,
        however, the old printer&#8217;s words came back to him as a roadmark
        in his search for the cause of industrial depressions, and the cause
        of inequality
        in the distribution of wealth.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>... So it went. Every turn of public affairs brought up the
      old haunting questions. Even here in California he was now seeing symptoms
      of the same inequality that
        had oppressed him in New York. &#8220;Bonanza kings&#8221; were coming
        to the front, and four ex-shopkeepers of Sacramento, Stanford, Crocker,
        Huntington,
        and Hopkins, were laying up immense fortunes out of the Central Pacific.
        The <a href="Railroads.html">railway</a> was
        bringing in population and commodities, which everybody thought was a good
        thing all round, yet wages were going down, exactly as the old printer in Philadelphia
        had said, and the masses were growing worse off instead of better.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>About this matter of wages, George had had other testimony
      besides the old printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a dozen years before, he fell in with
        a lot of miners who were talking about the Chinese, and ventured to ask what
        harm the Chinese were doing as long as they worked only the cheap diggings. &#8220;No
        harm now,&#8221; one of the miners said, &#8220;but wages will not always
        be as high as they are today in California. <a href="Population_Growth.html">As
        the country grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>, and some
        day or other white people will be glad to get those diggings that the
        Chinamen are working.&#8221; George said that this idea, coming on top of what the printer
        had said, made a great impression on him &#8212; the idea that &#8220;<a href="Progress.html">as
        the country grew in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>, the
        condition of those who had to work for their living must become, not
        better, but worse.&#8221; Yet
        in the short space of a dozen years this was precisely what was taking
        place before his own eyes.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Still, though his two great questions became more and more
      pressing, he could not answer them. His thought was still inchoate. He
      went around and around
        his ultimate answer, like somebody fumbling after something on a table
      in the dark, often actually touching it without being aware that it was
      what he was
        after. Finally it came to him in a burst of true Cromwellian or Pauline
      drama out of &#8220;the commonplace reply of a passing teamster to a commonplace
        question.&#8221; One day in 1871 he went for a horseback ride, and as
        he stopped to rest his horse on a rise overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div align="left">
      <p>&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say,
            what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that
            they looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t know exactly, but there
            is a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like
            a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty
            with advancing wealth. <a href="Population_Growth.html">With the growth
            of population</a>, land grows in value, and the men who work it must
            pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly shot up so high in California in
        1849 that cooks in the restaurants of San Francisco got $500 a month? The reason
        now was simple and clear. It was because the placer mines were found on <a href="Land_Common_Property.html">land
        that did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and work them
        without having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the lands had been owned
        by somebody, it would have been land-values instead of wages that would have
        so suddenly shot up.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Exactly this was what had taken place on these grazing lands
      overlooking San Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific meant to make its terminus
      at Oakland, the
        increased population would need the land around Oakland to settle on,
      and land values had jumped up to a thousand dollars an acre. Naturally,
      then,
      George
        reasoned, the more public improvements there were, the better the transportation
        facilities, the larger the population, the more industry and commerce &#8212; the
        more of everything that makes for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the
        more would land values tend to rise, and the more would wages and interest
        tend
        to fall.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>George rode home thoughtful, translating the teamster&#8217;s
      commonplace reply into the technical terms of economics. He reasoned that
      there are <a href="Three-Factor_Economics.html">three
        factors in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural resources,
        labor, and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated, obviously
        the whole yield of production is divided into wages, which go to labor,
        and interest,
        which goes to capital. But when they are appropriated, production has
        to carry a third charge &#8212; <a href="Rent.html">rent</a>. Moreover,
        wages and interest, when there is no rent, are regulated strictly by
        free competition;
        but rent is a monopoly-charge, and hence is always &#8220;all the traffic
        will bear.&#8221;</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Well, then, since <a href="Natural_Resources.html">natural
        resource values</a> are purely social in their origin, created by the community,
        should not rent go to the community rather than to the Individual? <a href="Untaxing.html">Why
          tax industry and enterprise at all</a> &#8212; why not just charge
          rent? There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership
          of natural
          resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his hands on, and make
          as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but let him pay the community
          their
          annual rental value, determined simply by what other people would be
          willing to pay for the use of the same holdings. George could see justification
          for
          wages and interest, on the ground of natural right; and for private
          ownership of natural resources, on the ground of public policy; but
          he could see
          none for the private appropriation of economic rent. In his view it
          was sheer <a href="Theft.html">theft</a>.
          If he was right, then it also followed that as long as economic rent
          remains unconfiscated, <a href="Piracy.html">the taxation of industry
          and enterprise is pure highwaymanry</a>, especially <a href="Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation,

          from the earth a portion of it and mould it into useful things for
          the use of man. Without
          land man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First
          of all, he must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until
          the single
          tax is applied. It has been proven by the history of the human race
          that
          the single tax does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim.
          For instance, man turned from Europe, filled with a population of the
          poor, and
          discovered the great continent of America. Here, when he could not
          get profitable employment, he went on the free land and worked for
          himself,
          and in those
          early days there were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and
          no extremely poor &#8212; because there was cheap land. Men could go to work

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Picture an unpopulated island
        where we're going to produce one
        good, corn, and there are eleven grades of land. On the best land, we
        can grow ten bushels of corn per week; the second land grows nine
        bushels, and so on to the worst land that grows zero bushels. We'll
        ignore capital goods at first. The first settlers go the best land.
        While there is free ten-bushel land, rent is zero, so wages are 10.
        When the 10-bushel land is all settled, immigrants go to the 9-bushel
        land. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Wages in the 9-bushel land equal
        9 while free land is available.
        What then are wages in the 10-bushel land? They must also be 9, since
        labor is mobile. If you offer less, nobody will come, and if you
        offer a bit more than 9, everybody in the 9-bushel land will want to
        work for you. Competition among workers makes wages the same all over
        (we assume all workers are alike). So that extra bushel in the
        10-bushel land, after paying 9 for labor, is rent. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That border line where the best
        free land is being settled is
        called the "margin of production." When the margin moves to the
        8-bushel land, wages drop to 8. Rent is now 1 on the 9-bushel land and
        2 on the 10-bushel land. Do you see what the trend is? As the margin
        moves to less productive lands, wages are going down and rent is
        going up. We can also now see that wages are determined at the margin
        of production. That is the "law of wages." The wage at the margin
        sets the wage for all lands. The production in the better lands left
        after paying wages goes to rent. That is the "law of rent." If you
        understand the law of wages and the law of rent, you see the cat! To
        complete our cat story, suppose folks can get land to rent and sell
        for higher prices later rather than using it now. This land
        speculation will hog up lands and make the margin move further out
        than without speculation, lowering wages and raising rent even more....</small><span

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the
        classical liberal conception of justice
        are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
        issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
        natural opportunities to be established?</small>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his statement
        that we own what we produce
        with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
        common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
        the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
        are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
        the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
        there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span>
        Locke does not address
        the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</small></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One tradition in classical
        liberalism concerning claims to land is
        that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
        as exemplified by Murray
        Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
        Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
        appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
        are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
        as inspired if not
        exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
        opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
        that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
        for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
        he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any
        excess in one's claim
        generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
        George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
        nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
        and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
        have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
        generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
        fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental problems
        with the position of
        homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
        incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
        environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
        those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
        backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
        displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
        violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
        without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
        who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
        practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
        the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
        fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
        rectified.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
        with the position of the
        homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
        unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
        ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
        allocating land.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
        thing, as people stampeded to do
        whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
        decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
        necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
        libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
        because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
        scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
        get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
        natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
        practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
        complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
        another lecture.)</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice is thus a regime in
        which persons have the greatest
        possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
        share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
        reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
        acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
        that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
        opportunities. </small><small>...</small> <small><small>&nbsp; <big><a

            will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there is no destitution. No one
            makes an easy living, nor a very good living; but every one can make a living,
          and no one able and willing to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>

              world, and greater utilization of labor-saving machinery, make possible
              greater economies in production and exchange, and wealth in consequence

        Current Doctrine of Wages &#8212; Its Insufficiency</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>... Eliminating from interest the element of insurance, and regarding only
            interest proper, or the return for the use of capital, is it not a general
            truth
            that interest is high where and when wages are high, and low where and when
            wages
              are low? Both wages and interest have been higher in the United States
            than in England, in the Pacific than in the Atlantic
          States. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is it not a notorious fact that where labor flows for higher wages, capital
            also flows for higher interest? </li>
            <li>Is it not true that wherever there has been a general rise or fall in
              wages there has been at the same time a similar rise or fall in interest?
              In California,
                  for instance, when wages were higher than anywhere else in the world,
              so also was interest higher. Wages and interest have in California gone
              down
                  together. When common wages were $5 a day, the ordinary bank rate of
              interest was twenty-four per cent per annum. Now that common wages are
              $2 or $2.50
            a day, the ordinary bank rate is from ten to twelve per cent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now, this broad, general fact, that wages are higher in new countries, where
            capital is relatively scarce, than in old countries, where capital is relatively
            abundant, is too glaring to be ignored. And although very lightly touched upon,
            it is noticed by the expounders of the current political economy. The manner
            in which it is noticed proves what I say, that it is utterly inconsistent with
            the accepted theory of wages. For in explaining it such writers as Mill, Fawcett,
            and Price virtually give up the theory of wages upon which, in the same treatises,
            they formally insist. Though they declare that wages are fixed by the ratio
            between capital and laborers, they explain the higher wages and interest of
            new countries by the greater relative production of wealth. I shall hereafter
            show that this is not the fact, but that, on the contrary, the production of
            wealth is relatively larger in old and densely populated countries than in
            new and sparsely populated countries. But at present I merely wish to point
            out the inconsistency. For to say that the higher wages of new countries are
            due to greater proportionate production, is clearly to make the ratio with
          production, and not the ratio with capital, the determinator of wages.</p>
          <p>Though this inconsistency does not seem to have been perceived by the class
            of writers to whom I refer, it has been noticed by one of the most logical
            of the expounders of the current political economy. Professor Cairnes* endeavors
            in a very ingenious way to reconcile the fact with the theory, by assuming
            that in new countries, where industry is generally directed to the production
            of food and what in manufactures is called raw material, a much larger proportion
            of the capital used in production is devoted to the payment of wages than in
            older countries where a greater part must be expended in machinery and material,
            and thus, in the new country, though capital is scarcer, and interest is higher,
            the amount determined to the payment of wages is really larger, and wages are
            also higher. For instance, of $100,000 devoted in an old country to manufactures,
            $80,000 would probably be expended for buildings, machinery and the purchase
            of materials, leaving but $20,000 to be paid out in wages; whereas in a new
            country, of $30,000 devoted to agriculture, etc., not more than $5,000 would
            be required for tools, etc., leaving $25,000 to be distributed in wages. In
            this way it is explained that the wage fund may be comparatively large where
            capital is comparatively scarce, and high wages and high interest accompany
          each other. ... <a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">read the entire chapter </a></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Here, let us imagine, is <b>an unbounded savannah</b>, stretching off in
            unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires
            of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle
            he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
            wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely
            no choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out
            with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
            anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
            rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
            at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
            him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
            would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
            material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
            any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
            his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
            cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
            a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
            short, a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
            schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such
            things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on
            hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
            making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do
            so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger
            may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances,
            though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him
            to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy
          only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
          <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
            boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
            by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
            there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
            that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
            by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
            and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
          two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
              the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
              quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler
              under the Homestead Act. </font>          <br>
          </div>
          Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
          there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
          are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
          state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
          a logrolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years.
          When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill,
          and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster,
          and the children of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching
          would have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
          send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need
          for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our
          settler can have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
          cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a
          postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the
          world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little
          church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state
          were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the intellectual
          nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power
          of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
          open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others
          to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees,
          and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered
          and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the strain,
          and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire
          and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands
          human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer
          to open up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
          times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and
          power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John
          Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
          talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the
          prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of
          fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
          and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
          circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
          sandy deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised
          Joseph from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the
          Alps with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music
          that thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
          of Kubla Khan.
          <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
              you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
              you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
              is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
              need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
              you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
              of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
              potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
              and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
              we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
              all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
              increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
              things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
              it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
              yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
              far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
              upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
              this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
              stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
              not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
              the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
              the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
              land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
              center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
              of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
          will be raised.</p>
          <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
              economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
              of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
              the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
              it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
              into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
              With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
              land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
              expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
              of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
              branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
              especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
              in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
              go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
              and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
              the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
              of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
              distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
              the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
              power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
              acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
              had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
              fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
              transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
              and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
              themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
          has given the land.</p>
          <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
              to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
              into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
              still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
              the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
              becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
              are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
              friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
              that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
              one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
              set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
              have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
              is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
              into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
              of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
              of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
              museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
              all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
              actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
          is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
          <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
              of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
              over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
              tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
              eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
              engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
          of horses. </p>
          <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
                other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
                focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
                of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
                attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
                fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
                the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
                productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
                has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another <a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip
                Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
                from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
                are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
                than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
                more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
                streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
                finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
                Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
                same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
          it had no value at all.</p>
          <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
              in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
              him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
              difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
              rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
              compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
              which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
              valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
              not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
          utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
          <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
              gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
              attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
              of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
              makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
              rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
          of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
          <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
                as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
                heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
                brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
                fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
                fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
                Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
                and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
                be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
          will have greatly increased.</p>

        Robinson Crusoe Story

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, Robinson G.
        Crusoe was the only survivor of a ship
        that sunk. He floated on a piece of wood to an unpopulated island.
        Robinson was an absolute geoist. He believed with his mind, heart, and
        soul that everyone should have an equal share of land rent.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Since he was the only person on this island, it was all his. He
        surveyed the island and found that the only crop available for
        cultivation was alfalfa sprouts. The land was divided into 5 grades
        that could grow 8, 6, 4, 2, and zero bushels of alfalfa sprouts per
        month. There was one acre each for 8, 6, and 4, and 100 acres of
        2-bushel land. For 8 hours per day of labor, he could work 4 acres. So
        he could grow, per month, 8+6+4+2 = 20 bushels of alfalfa sprouts, much
        more than enough to feed on.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>One day another survivor of a sunken ship floated to the island.
        His
        name was Friday George. Friday was a boring talker and kept chattering
        about trivialities, which greatly irritated Robinson. "I possess the
        whole island. You may only have this rocky area," said Robinson. ... <a
