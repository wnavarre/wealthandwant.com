    <blockquote>
      <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a
        revenue tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous
        application of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak
        of it as free trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction
        on trade than a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not merely abolish
all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

          of Louis F. Post's Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers,
        enters into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate
        of profit upon that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers.
        The tax and the manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of
        the wholesale price and are collected from retailers. The retailers in
        turn collect the tax with all intermediate profits upon it, together
        with their :usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final purchasers
        &#8212; the consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface to
        be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an indirect
        tax
        upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of profits upon the tax
        considerably more than the government receives.</p>
      <p>The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were
        imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount
        of the tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and
        collect the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation,
        of tanning and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect
        with their profit from retailers, who would collect with their profit
        from shoe consumers. The principle applies also when taxes are levied
        upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or the money or credits of
        bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual profit to the prices of
        their goods, and bankers add it to their interest and discounts.</p>
      <p>For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers or importers
        would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost wholesalers $110,000;
        at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
        and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
        of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would
        get. Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that
        indirect taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when
        imposed only upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when
        imposed upon materials also, the cost of collection might well run far
        above 200 percent in addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery
        of taxation.</p>
      <p>It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect taxes
        from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers,
        or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to
        interest, it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do
        this; it is because the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers,
        merchants, and other tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must
        on the average sell their goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit,
        or go out of business. It follows that any increase in cost of production
        tends to increase the price of products. Now, a tax upon the output of
        business men, which they must pay as a condition of doing their business,
        is as truly part of the cost of their output as is the price of the materials
        they buy or the wages of the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon
        business men tends to increase the price of their products. And this
        tendency is more or less marked as the tax is more or less great and
        competition more or less keen. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
      <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are
        individually entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that
        arise from such relations as that of the family) to the use of their
        own powers and the enjoyment of the results. There thus arises, anterior
        to human law, and deriving its validity from the law of God, a right
        of private ownership in things produced by labor &#8212; a right that
        the possessor may transfer, but of which to deprive him without his will
        is theft.</p>
      <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to
        himself, is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches
        to things produced by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
      <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
        in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift.
        But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that
        he may sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
      <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
        such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right
        of property in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others
        to use it.</p>
      <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain
        his labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property
        in the sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things
        are of the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all
        may use, but none may claim as his alone.</p>
      <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership
        that justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny
        the true rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his
        labor is obliged to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine
        or soil, all of which are to men involved in the single term land, is
        in this deprived of his rightful property and thus robbed.<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></p>
      <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right
        to the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products
        of labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For
        we are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he
        has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
        is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
        life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
        you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed
        order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw
        and provided that with the increase of population and the development
        of industry the organization of human society into states or governments
        would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
      <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
        This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
        industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
        growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
        state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
      <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
        civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
        become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
        foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
        for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
        social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a right
        way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is the way
        intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising public revenues
        must accord with the moral law.</p>
      <p>Hence:</p>
      <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
      <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the
        prices of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
      <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by
        making it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
      <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken
        the sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not
        sins, and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted
        right to do.</p>
      <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not
        punish thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production
        and the fairest division of wealth.</p>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and
        products of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues
        are collected &#8212; the octroi duties that surround Italian cities
        with barriers; the monstrous customs duties that hamper intercourse between
        so-called Christian states; the taxes on occupations, on earnings, on
        investments, on the building of houses, on the cultivation of fields,
        on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these be the ways God has intended
        that governments should raise the means they need? Have any of them the
        characteristics indispensable in any plan we can deem a right one?</p>
      <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs
        to the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over
        the scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase
        the price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt
        government; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine
        industry and thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and
        enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
      <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
      <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
        are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of
        life, that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. <strong>But
        out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and
        out of its effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell
        and others must buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which
        denies this gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy
        and proclaims laws of national well-being utterly at variance with his
        teaching. </strong>This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal
        war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies
        in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do
        not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
        of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
      <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more
        clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not
        the way God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
      <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues
        by a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to
        tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
        any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
        values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
        exempt. The value of land irrespective of improvement is the value that
        attaches to land by reason of increasing population and social progress.
        This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and never does
        and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different person from
        the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money;
        while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that
        he receives it, and by selling or renting the land he can, as owner,
        continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
      <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
        of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
        what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
        to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to
        the community as a whole.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all
            economists are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement
            or use &#8212; or what in the terminology of political economy is
            styled rent, a term distinguished from the ordinary use of the word
            rent by being applied solely to payments for the use of land itself &#8212; must
            be paid by the owner and cannot be shifted by him on the user. To
            explain in another way the reason given in the text: Price is not
            determined by the will of the seller or the will of the buyer, but
            by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to things
            constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
            by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the
            cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
            increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce
            such cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat
            or tobacco or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay,
            and thus the cheapening in the cost of producing steel which improved
            processes have made in recent years has greatly reduced the price
            of steel. But land has no cost of production, since it is created
            by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
              by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of
              deprivation and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all
              that common labor can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
      2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
      particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
      by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
      for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
      3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
      withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore
            never be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in
            no wise increase the demand for land or enable landowners to check
            supply by withholding land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization,
            a case I mention because rent may in this way be demanded for the
            use of land even before economic or natural rent arises, the taking
            by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort from labor
            could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not
            left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent
            proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they receive, would
            in no way increase the superiority of their land and the demand for
            it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent, to compel
            the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they were
            getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult for
            them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
            merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
        of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
        to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
        impose <strong>no burden on industry</strong>, <strong>no check on commerc</strong>e, no punishment on
        thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
        of wealth, by <strong>leaving men free to produce and to exchange as
        they please, without any artificial enhancement of prices</strong>; and by taking for public
        purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that
        of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply
        collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense
        with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish
        man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
      <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
        it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and
        degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother
        for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
      <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need
        for the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor
        have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches
        to land itself. But as increasing density of population and increasing
        elaboration of industry necessitate the organization of the state, with
        its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land. As population
        still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so the needs for public
        revenues increase. And at the same time and from the same causes land
        values increase. The connection is invariable. The value of things produced
        by labor tends to decline with social development, since the larger scale
        of production and the improvement of processes tend steadily to reduce
        their cost. But the value of land on which population centers goes up
        and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne. Consider
        the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
        of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
        due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of
        those cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure
        for streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed
        for the health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how
        with the growth of such cities the one thing that steadily increases
        in value is land; how the opening of roads, the building of railways,
        the making of any public improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it
        not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to say a tendency
        willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He who ordained
        the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land provided
        the means to meet those needs?</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
    writers and reporters in this new field accept state and
    local sales taxes as part of the ordained order of things.</span> The
    predominant attitude is one of how to preserve and raise the state
    sales tax, by taxing purchases from "foreign" (out-of-state)
    sources, which are regarded as an administrative nuisance and a
    leakage. </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
    textbooks on public finance do not treat the general retail
    sales tax as the historical novelty that it is. They no longer
    mention that no state taxed retail sales until 1929 (GA) and 1930
    (MS), and most not until 1933 (when California joined the movement
    with a rate of 2%) and the mid-thirties, by which time half the
    states joined in. Few books give any weight to the fact that 5 states
    and one province (Alberta) have no sales tax at all: the states are
    Alaska, Oregon, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Montana. </span>The
    academics
    treat these states as eccentrics and laggards, and trivialize them
    for their small populations, but the states in question, which have
    10 U.S. Senators among them, do not see themselves that way at all.
    </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>One of them, Oregon, in 1980 retired the powerful Chairman
    of the
    House Committee on Ways and Means, Al Ullman, because he championed a
    Federal VAT. 
        </small></li>
      <li><small>Another, New Hampshire, plays a key role in screening
    presidential candidates. It is rather a matter of some local pride,
    not to mention commercial advantage.<strong> ...</strong>    </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Few
    academics show much concern about the sales tax's partiality
    and non-uniformity. They enumerate a few exemptions, but then favor
    it because it allegedly exempts capital formation. ... </span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even more surprising is the
    attitude of business sources. You'd
    think they'd show some delight that a new way has been found to
    undercut the sales tax. Instead, many of these works might as well be
    written by tax administrators. Their main concern may be making sure
    that other firms pay, too. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">My
    viewpoint is the reverse. I am here to explore how e-commerce
    may work as a lever to lower or quash sales taxes, and to show how
    states may do that without making catastrophic quakes or waves.</span> </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The U.S. Constitution bans state
    taxes on interstate commerce.
"The Congress shall have the power ... to regulate Commerce with
    foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian
    tribes; ... " - (Article I, Sect. 8).</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"No State shall, w/o the consent
    of Congress, lay any Imposts or
    Duties on Imports or Exports, ... (Article I, Sect. 10). This
    reinforces the commerce clause of Sect. 8. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Commerce
    Clause has preserved interstate tax competition.
    Without it, it is likely that state sales taxes would rise to 20% or
    more in short order, as the wholesome fear of interstate competition
    was stifled.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">It created and
    has preserved our domestic market, the
    greatest free trade zone in the world, an essential ingredient of
    American productivity and prosperity. It is not something to be
    thrown away lightly, especially not for the sake of something as
    baneful as the retail sales tax.
    </span></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>States may tax imports "with the
    consent of Congress." McGoldrick
    v. Berwind White (1940) established they might apply a sales tax if
    the seller has a nexus in the taxing state. Quill Co. v. N.D. 1992,
    seems to have established that Congress has the power to enact
    legislation allowing states to levy sales and use tax on remote
    sales, including mail-order and electronic sales, without the current
    requirement of physical presence. Congress and the President have the
    power to require all online vendors (and all mail-order sellers) to
    collect sales and use tax on all sales to all states.
    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That's interesting, but Congress
    doesn't pass laws just because it
    may.
    </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Net result:&nbsp; </b>Look
    forward to a new world in which forms of taxation must change
    substantially. There must be more emphasis on immobile assets. That
    is not necessarily a bad thing: we've been there and done that, and
    it wasn't half bad. Professor Wallace Oates, Univ. of MD, writing in
    the current Review of Economic Literature, refers his readers to his
    study of Pittsburgh, where he and a colleague found that a shift to a
    more immobile tax base, land, may have caused a rise in building
    activity. I cite Prof. Oates because he and Prof. Robert Schwab
    approached their subject in the most cautious imaginable way, and
    their conclusions are about as soft-pedaled as is humanly possible
    from the data they present. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
    What would happen in California if we eliminated the sales tax,
    and replaced it by raising the property tax?</span><br>
    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. No catastrophe </b>Five
    states and the Province of Alberta already get along nicely
    with no sales tax, so it must be possible.&nbsp; No state at all had a
    retail sales tax before 1929 (GA). <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">California opened its
    gates in
    1933</span> with the Riley-Stuart Act, and so did several other states.
    It
    was sold as an "emergency measure," <span style="font-weight: bold;">at
    a rate of 2%.</span>    </small></li>
      <li><small>As late as 1977
    it was 4.75%. 
        </small></li>
      <li><small>Now it is 7.25% statewide, with many cities, counties
    and transportation districts adding their tolls to the total, but for
    most of our state's existence we got along nicely with either no
    sales tax, or much lower rates than today. </small><small></small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Property Tax rate would rise
    to a level lower than it was
    before Prop. 13. <span style="font-weight: bold;">California sales tax
    revenues are currently 1.19% of
    the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessed Value (A.V.) of
    taxable property</span>. Add that to the
    current 1%, and get 2.19%, compared to 2.7% before Prop. 13 - except
    that the 2.7% was applied to actual value, while today's assessed
    valuations are far below that.</span> </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The A.V. value of land is probably
    about 1/3 or so of market
    value; buildings are closer to market. </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Greater equity: </b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The distribution of the tax burden would
    shift from poor counties
    to richer ones. </span>Thus,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
    </span></small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>in the poor inland counties of Fresno, Tulare,
    Imperial, and Stanislaus, sales tax revenues are about 1.5% of A.V.s. 
        </small></li>
      <li><small>In rich coastal and suburban counties of Sta. Barbara and
    Marin,
    sales tax revenues are about .75% of A.V.s. 
        </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the state sales tax
    takes a lot more money from the poor counties than it would cost them
    to replace the services from local taxes; the rich counties, with the
    high property tax bases, are contributing less to the common pool
    than they are saving in property taxes. </span></small><small><small

    Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two different
    kinds of indirect taxation</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>One of the most perverted twisting of concepts is reflected in
    what Hamilton called "indirect taxation." To him, and to many royal
    libertarians, indirect taxation is "hidden" taxation, as a
    value-added tax or sales tax that is buried in the price of purchased
    goods. This kind of indirectness is hardly admirable, and is similar
    to the kind of indirectness involved in chicanery and duplicity.
    Small wonder Jefferson called Hamilton a monarchist.</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Articles of Confederation
    embodied an entirely different
    concept of indirect taxation. The United States was to levy a tax,
    not on individual property holders, but on each state, based on its
    aggregate land value. The assumption was that each state would levy a
    similar tax on each county, and so on down to the individual. In this
    way, the individual would never have to face a federal tax agent
    directly, and if the federal government did not have the full support
    of the states, it could not bully them as easily as it could bully
    individuals.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unfortunately, states did not
    support the federal government to
    its satisfaction from the beginning (being strapped from the war).
    Rather than working things out patiently, Hamilton introduced
    power-centralizing measures into the new Constitution. One was the
    other kind of indirect taxation, the mosquito-bite kind that you
    don't see happening. Royal libertarians trumpet this covert taxation
    as a virtue over direct real estate taxation, even when it means that
"free trade" is being taxed. ... <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html"><span

          services that we produce belong to the producers and no one else. But
          you support the income tax and the sales tax. Those taxes take away
          from the producer, without his or her consent, part of what he or she
          produced. So it doesn't seem that you really believe your own claims.
          Why should people support the Polluter Pays Principle that says they
          are stuck with negative products they produce, when at the same time
          you wouldn't allow them to keep the positive products they produce?
          Sounds like an uneven deal."</small><br>

          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara is shocked. But she has to admit Vernon
          has a
          point. "Hmm, I guess this might be part of why the Polluter Pays
          Principle doesn't excite as much support as it should. If we lived in a
          world where people get to keep the full value of whatever their labor
          and their investment yields, then pollution would stand out in sharp
          contrast, as a crime against innocent people and their property. The
          Polluter Pays Principle would be totally obvious then."</small><br>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
          applied these inherent differences
          between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
          incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
          products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
          from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
          upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
          exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
          ...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
          finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
          building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
          tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
          from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
          upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
          government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
          of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
          production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
          supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
          land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
          the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
          land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
          speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
          values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
          reduce the price of land." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span

          of the land of Alabama were paying less than $1 per acre in property
          taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been no mistake and that
          Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country. Her righteous
          rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
          scene.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a
          design of a tax structure this bad," she said in a Tuscaloosa News
          story last February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust
          and has no moral, ethical leg to stand on. Period."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>
          Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes
          in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just
          4.1 percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of
          property taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes
          are among the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas,
          and do not exempt even the most basic necessities such as food. The
          state's 1901 constitution was written primarily by large landholders to
          secure their economic interests, consequently property taxes are
          extremely light on their holdings. ...</small>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
"Alabama's tax system is most abusive because it taxes items like milk,
          yet offers tax breaks for certain farm products," she said in a
          Huntsville Times (3/26/03) interview. "It's also unfair to allow
          timberland (which Hamill found out accounts for 71 percent of Alabama
          land) to generate only two percent of all state property taxes."<br>
          <br>
          While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like
"horrific" and "monstrous injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax
          reform approach which shifts taxes off of low wage earners and onto
          large land owners. Through a combination of her own reasoning, caring
          heart, and inherent sense of justice and a thorough investigation of
          Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax policy approach which
          bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of 19th
          century reformer, Henry George.<br>
          <br>
          Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call
          themselves Christians. Hamill challenges them to put their faith into
          practice. Her message fell on many already listening ears. The state's
          two largest denominations, United Methodists and Southern Baptists, had
          passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In 2001 the state's
          Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar calls. The
          Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council of
          Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now
          supported by most of the state's religious organizations, according to
          Charles Durham, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
          <br>
          What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama
          tax code combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural
          bases for economic justice. She quotes chapters and verses which
          proclaim that the poor should not be oppressed and that society should
          create conditions for their advance. Among her favorites are Jesus'
          words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least
          of these, you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich
          man sent to hell because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
          in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and
          so all went well." ...</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
          Riley's tax plan, inspired in large measure by Hamill's prophetic tax
          justice ministry, would bring in an additional $1.2 billion in revenue
          while raising the income threshold at which families of four start
          paying taxes from the current $4,600 a year to more than $17,000,
          scrapping the federal income tax deduction, and increasing exemptions
          for dependent children. It would give property tax breaks to small
          family farms, while costing millions to the state's 500 or so farms and
          timber tracts with more than 2,000 acres each, which includes companies
          like Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade, which own hundreds of thousands of
          acres.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>
"I've spent a lot of time studying the New Testament and it has three
          philosophies: love God, love each other, and take care of the least
          among you," said Riley (New York Times, 6/10/03, "What Would Jesus Do?
          Sock It to Alabama's Corporate Landowners")</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>
          Unfortunately, Alabama voters overwhelmingly voted against the plan on
          September 9, 2003. Some said that the poor did not trust the Republican
          tax relief plan and the rich had solidly organized against it.
          Opponents made hay out of the proposed sales tax increase on
          cigarettes, cars and lawn mowers and services like car repairs in a
          state where sales taxes already reach 11% in some areas. ...&nbsp;<span
