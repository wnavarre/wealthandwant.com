<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural
Capital
</span></div>
<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
  Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
  </a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all this is the
argument that manufactured capital (i.e.,
that created by human beings), and natural capital (those resources
provided by nature) are not substitutable, as well as the belief that
current practices portend irreversible consequences for the earth&#8217;s
environmental stability. Nor can the various components of natural
capital alone be regarded as interchangeable goods. Natural gas might
in some instances be a substitute energy source for coal, and chicken
an alternative protein source to beef. But fundamentally each element
is to a significant extent unique in nature &#8212; fulfilling its own
special niche in what ecologists call <em><strong>lexicographic uniqueness</strong></em>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conventional thinkers argue that these two classes of natural
and
man-made capital are mostly substitutable, in what ecological
economists have called &#8220;weak sustainability.&#8221; But the contrary, &#8220;strong
sustainability,&#8221; is at the heart of ecological economics, going even
further than many authors of the Brundtland Commission Report would
have accepted by recognizing the&nbsp;lexicographic
character and place of each and every element of the biota.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">95</span></small> There
is no definitional consensus, however. The Clinton-Gore administration,
for example, established a President&#8217;s Council on Sustainable
Development on June 15, 1993, and adopted the Brundtland Commission&#8217;s
language. But it carefully avoided any detailed definition of what was
meant by sustainability.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">96</span></small>
Subsequent executive orders and press releases have been equally vague
as to what definition of sustainability is being used,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">97 </span></small>and
to this day the matter remains unsettled. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Green taxes, sometimes also called corrective taxes or Pigouvian
taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The authors would further
impose the full costs, in the form of taxes,
on the depletion of natural capital resources.</span> This in turn
would both
discourage the improvident use of such materials and encourage their
re-use and recycling beyond what economic arrangements now provide for.
They also argue strongly for tariffs and trade barriers that would
foster linkages between existing local community enterprises, since
they view economic globalization as a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; with respect
to the exploitation of both resources (land) and labor. These tariffs
would apply not only to protect the viability of certain social and
political units but to ecological systems generally, so that their
protection would be better guaranteed against the ravages of market
exploitation.... <a

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"<span
 style="font-style: italic;">NATURAL CAPITALISM</span>" - A CASE STUDY
IN BLINDNESS TO LAND VALUE TAXATION</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This book by Hawken &amp; Lovins is meticulously researched,
well-argued and rather deserving of its best-selling status, yet it
completely misses the need for LVT. As such, it is illustrative of how
so many major advantages of LVT can be momentarily grasped and then
mislaid.</small><br>
<br>
<small>At the very beginning<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[20]</span></small> the
authors make a exhaustive list of natural resources (which they term <span
 style="font-style: italic;">natural capital</span>)
used by humankind, yet fail to mention the one on which we all need to
stand! In the wide-ranging review which follows, the authors appear to
come tantalizingly close to grasping many of the direct benefits of
LVT, only to lose the thread and conclude the book, no closer to a
realisation of the monumental impact LVT would bring about.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The authors devote a full 17 pages<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[21]</span></small>
to the Brazilian city of Curitiba, holding it up as emblematic of an
enlightened municipality which has overcome a whole raft of economic,
social and environmental problems. Yet, even though the authors
explicitly state that "The city runs mainly on property taxes"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[22]</span></small> and
acknowledge how property taxpayers are intimately involved in the
decision-making process<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[23]</span></small>
, they investigate these matters no further. Had they understood how
LVT allows environmental custodianship to be self-funding by recycling
enhanced land values, they would have seized the significance of LVT in
their account of Curitiba's green renewal which concludes "And green
begets green; land values around the new parks have risen sharply, and
with them tax revenues."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[24]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Elsewhere, they see the small picture, but not the big. A solid
case is
mounted to make driving and parking vehicles bear their true costs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[25]</span></small>
(this is, of course, LVT in the form of renting of temporary or
"moving" parcels of land), but cannot see the wood for the trees.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Urban sprawl deservedly receives much attention, yet the
powerful
impetus LVT gives to put land to its optimal use and bring about a more
compact cityscape remains unnoticed. Toronto's inducement to clustering
around urban corridors is praised, but no inquiry is made into its
"density bonuses and penalties".<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[26] </span></small>Also
left tantalizingly unexplained is the statement "Mortgage and tax rules
that subsidize dispersed suburbs are another long-standing cause of
sprawl."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[27]</span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small>Geoism eliminates the curse of land speculation by making it
economically unaffordable to hold onto land that is not put to its
optimal use. In the study of Curitiba, the authors recognise the ills
of speculation<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[28]</span></small>
, but demonstrate their limited vision by stating "A good start to
correcting these costly distortions would be to make developers bear
the expenses they impose on the community."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[29]</span></small>
Of course, we ALL should pay for costs we impose on the community, just
as the authors rightly say elsewhere that we should all pay for costs
imposed on the environment. In terms of LVT, "in proportion to what we
take from the community (in terms of the exclusive use we make of
land), we should repay." Or, in more general terms, "Pay for what we
take, not what we make." On this point (the present practice of taxing
production), the authors have clearly seen the inequity and economic
disadvantages of such punitive taxes<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[30] </span></small>,
as well as the folly of subsidising the use of natural resources
(surely such subsidies should be seen as negative eco-taxes?!)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[31]</span></small> .</small><br>
<br>
<small>The authors' otherwise first-rate survey and set of proposals
ends on a
disappointing and baffling note when take the conventional approach of
viewing the Earth as a speculative commodity and bemoan plummeting real
estate prices in Southern California<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[32]</span></small>
. While the case for adopting a wide range of technical innovations has
been convincingly argued, until the Geoist perspective has been taken,
there is little to substantiate the authors claim that this a
"revolutionary paradigm for the industrial economy".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_FOTSS.html">The
Fallacy of the "Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Taking first the argument that spreading the tax
burden over as wide a base of sources as possible, it is best to begin
by noting that revenue streams can be drawn from only three elements of
the economy:&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Land, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Labor, and/or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Capital.&nbsp;    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Standard textbooks for Economics
101 typically start with recognition
of these factors, even if they usually give insufficient attention to
Land as a component.&nbsp; Classical economics, culminating
particularly in the tradition of <a href="About_HG.html">Henry George</a>,
includes in the idea of
Land any and all components of value not created by human hands or
minds.&nbsp; It therefore means not just locational sites on the
earth's surface that might be bought and sold as real estate, but other
elements of so-called "natural capital" as well:&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the electromagnetic spectrum, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>air, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>fish in the ocean, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>mineral wealth, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>airport time slots, and so on.&nbsp;    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those elements have a market
price, and can be -- indeed are -- often
subject to taxation.&nbsp; It is important to note, however, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">taxes on such Land are capitalized in the
market value of their worth; they cannot be passed forward or backward
because their supply is essentially inelastic.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This
is
important, as will be noted below, because imposing such taxes incurs
no excess burden on their use or upon the general economy.</span>&nbsp;
Taxing such bases is totally neutral and completely efficient.&nbsp;
Indeed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">failure </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">to tax Land as stated that leads to
economic distortions and causes an economy to function at a sub-optimal
level.</span>&nbsp; Land, whatever its form, has a market value only to
the extent that a human presence exists to make use of it, and it
acquires that value due to the accretion of economic rent, the return
that comes to rest on such factors. &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes on
Labor and Capital, in contrast, are always shifted.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
