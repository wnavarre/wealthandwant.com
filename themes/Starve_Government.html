Government</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Georgists seek to reduce or eliminate a lot of the dumb taxes that government
    currently uses to collect the revenue necessary to provide the services we
  all depend on. But we don't necessarily seek to starve government.</p>
  <p>We seek to reduce or eliminate taxes on buildings, on sales, on wages, while
    at the same time increasing the revenue drawn from taxes on land value and
    on other things that are like land, including the electromagnetic spectrum,
    water rights, pollution rights, congestion charges, etc. </p>
  <p>Many of us believe that if a society shifts its tax burden off buildings,
    sales and wages and onto land value, many highly desirable things will happen,
    including the reduction or abolition of poverty and the reversal of urban
    sprawl. Each of these things will have highly positive ripple effects, which
    are very likely to include a reduction in demand for some of the kinds of
    services government now supplies, particularly to the poor. If we create
    a society where poverty is the exception and prosperity the general norm,
    many other social ills will disappear or be reduced to the point where they
    are manageable.</p>
  <p>Most of those who seek to &quot;starve government&quot; don't seem to
      particularly care about
        the effects of the services it provides on the lives of others. They
    themselves generally know they can pay for the services they want for themselves,
      and aren't all
        that interested in how what might serve their own interests will affect
      others. It
        would be interesting to know how many of them have lived in a diverse
    city, and how many of them choose to live in gated communities that are more
    homogeneous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>I sometimes wonder whether the &quot;starve government&quot; folks truly
    want to starve government, or merely don't understand that there is a viable
    alternative
    to the evils taxing income and sales. If one follows the precept of &quot;never
    ascribe to malice
      that which can be adequately explained by stupidity,&quot; and considers
      that few of our colleges or universities teach the ideas central to this
      website,
    one
      may come up with a new understanding: it isn't that the starve-government
      people are malicious <em>or </em>stupid,
      it is that their education has been neglected!</p>
  <p>A tax on land value does not burden productivity, but justly collects for
    the purposes of common spending that which rightly belongs to the community!
    I'm sure that this is something that Grover Norquist can  enthusiastically
    support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.</p>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
    not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
    Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is
    the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this.</p>
  <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
      <br />
  Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing
  the processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
  do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
  tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the
  payer works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes
  it, of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 25 or in lesser
  degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
  tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
  taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. I.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">25. It is common, besides taxing improvements, as fast
        as they are made, to levy higher taxes upon land when put to its best
        use than when put to partial use or to no use at all. This is upon the
        theory that when his land is used the owner gets full income from it
        and can afford to pay high taxes; but that he gets little or no income
        when the land is out of use, and so cannot afford to pay much. It is
        an absurd but perfectly legitimate illustration of the pretentious doctrine
        of taxation according to ability to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Examples are numerous. Improved building lots, and even
        those that are only plotted for improvement, are usually taxed more than
        contiguous unused and unplotted land which is equally in demand for building
        purposes and equally valuable. So coal land, iron land, oil land, and
        sugar land are as a rule taxed less as land when opened up for appropriate
        use than when lying idle or put to inferior uses, though the land value
        be the same. Any serious proposal to put land to its appropriate use
        is commonly regarded as a signal for increasing the tax upon it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers through
    many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase
        prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer,
        increasing as they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been
        often attempted, the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and
        the borrower must pay it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses
        it in his business, he in his turn must get back the tax from his customers,
        or his business becomes unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings,
        the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
        will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular
        profit and the tax besides. If we impose a tax upon manufactures or imported
        goods, the manufacturer or importer will charge it in a higher price
        to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and the retailer to the consumer.
        Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only
        pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this amount to everyone
        who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital he has advanced
        in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,
        book viii, ch. iii, subd. 2.</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>c. Certainty</em></p>
  <p>No other tax, direct or indirect, conforms so closely to the third maxim. &quot;Land
    lies out of doors.&quot; It cannot be hidden; it cannot be &quot;accidentally&quot; overlooked.
    Nor can its value be seriously misstated. Neither under-appraisement nor
    over-appraisement to any important degree is possible without the connivance
    of the whole community. 27 The land values of a neighborhood are matters
    of common knowledge. Any intelligent resident can justly appraise them, and
    every other intelligent resident can fairly test the appraisement. Therefore,
    the tyranny, corruption, fraud, favoritism, and evasions that are so common
    in connection with the taxation of imports, manufactures, incomes, personal
    property, and buildings &#8212; the values of which, even when the object
    itself cannot be hidden, are so distinctly matters of minute special knowledge
    that only experts can fairly appraise them &#8212; would be out of the question
    if the single tax were substituted for existing fiscal methods. 28</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">27. The under-appraisements so common at present, and
        alluded to in note 25, are possible because the community, ignorant of
        the just principles of taxation, does connive at them. Under-appraisements
        are not secret crimes on the part of assessors; they are distinctly recognized,
        but thoughtlessly disregarded when not actually insisted upon, by the
        people themselves. And this is due to the dishonest ideas of taxation
        that are taught. Let the vicious doctrine that people ought to pay taxes
        according to their ability give way to the honest principle that they
        should pay in proportion to the benefits they receive, which benefits,
        as we have already seen, are measured by the land values they own, and
        underappraisement of land would cease. No assessor can befool the community
        in respect of the value of the land within his jurisdiction.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And, with the cessation of general under-appraisement,
        favoritism in individual appraisements also would cease. General under-appraisement
        fosters unfair individual appraisements. If land were generally appraised
        at its full value, a particular unfair appraisement would stand out in
        such relief that the crime of the assessor would be exposed. But now
        if a man's land is appraised at a higher valuation than his neighbor's
        equally valuable land, and he complains of the unfairness, he is promptly
        and effectually silenced with a warning that his land is worth much more
        than it is appraised at, anyhow, and if he makes a fuss his appraisement
        will be increased. To complain further of the deficient taxation of his
        neighbor is to invite the imposition of a higher tax upon himself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">28. If you wish to test the merits in point of certainty
        of the single tax as compared with other taxes, go to a real estate agent
        in your community, and, showing him a building lot upon the map, ask
        him its value. If he inquires about the improvements, instruct him to
        ignore them. He will be able at once to tell you what the lot is worth.
        And if you go to twenty other agents their estimates will not materially
        vary from his. Yet none of the agents will have left his office. Each
        will have inferred the value from the size and location of the lot.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But suppose when you show the map to the first agent you
        ask him the value of the land and its improvements. He will tell you
        that he cannot give an estimate until he examines the improvements. And
        if it is the highly improved property of a rich man he will engage building
        experts to assist him. Should you ask him to include the value of the
        contents of the buildings, he would need a corps of selected experts,
        including artists and liverymen, dealers in furniture and bric-a-brac,
        librarians and jewelers. Should you propose that he also include the
        value of the occupant's income, the agent would throw up his hands in
        despair.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">If without the aid of an army of experts the agent should
        make an estimate of these miscellaneous values, and twenty others should
        do the same, their several estimates would be as wide apart as ignorant
        guesses usually are. And the richer the owner of the property the lower
        as a proportion would the guesses probably be.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now turn the real estate agent into an assessor, and is
        it not plain that he would appraise the land values with much greater
        certainty and cheapness than he could appraise the values of all kinds
        of property? With a plot map before him he might fairly make every appraisement
        without leaving his desk at the town hall.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And there would be no material difference if the property
        in question were a farm instead of a building lot. A competent farmer
        or business man in a farming community can, without leaving his own door-yard,
        appraise the value of the land of any farm there; whereas it would be
        impossible for him to value the improvements, stock, produce, etc., without
        at least inspecting them.</font></p>

  <p><em><strong>d. Equality</strong></em></p>
  <p>In respect of the fourth maxim the single tax bears more equally&#8212; that
    is to say, more justly &#8212; than any other tax. It is the only tax that
    falls upon the taxpayer in proportion to the pecuniary benefits he receives
    from the public; 29 and its tendency, accelerating with the increase of the
    tax, is to leave every one the full fruit of his own productive enterprise
    and effort. 30</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">29 The benefits of government are not the only public
        benefits whose value attaches exclusively to land. Communal development
        from whatever cause produces the same effect. But as it is under the
        protection of government that land-owners are able to maintain ownership
        of land and through that to enjoy the pecuniary benefits of advancing
        social conditions, government confers upon them as a class not only the
        pecuniary benefits of good government but also the pecuniary benefits
        of progress in general.</font></p>

        from the rent of land. Is it just that they should equally contribute
        to the expenses of the state? Evidently not. The income of the one represents
        wealth he creates and adds to the general wealth of the state; the income
        of the other represents merely wealth that he takes from the general
        stock, returning nothing.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book

that taxing Labor and Capital is detrimental to economic vitality &#8212; politicians

best able to exploit resentment about the negative impact of
taxes.&nbsp; But they are not alone in failing to appreciate the nature
of tax shifting.&nbsp; What all fail to realize is that there are
notable exceptions to the rule that taxes are oppressive: any tax
imposed on an inelastic base -- that is, any form of Land --
constitutes no distortion or excess burden whatsoever.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Far from
spreading the burden of distribution over a wide array of&nbsp; tax
bases, the ideal tax, then, should be imposed solely on those factors
of production that form an inelastic base, i.e., that constitute forms
of Land -- whether they be locational sites, natural resources, the
spectrum, time slots, or others as they may arise in the future.&nbsp;</span>
Land, in any of its forms, is totally inelastic.&nbsp; Will Rogers in
his pithy way said it well, "Buy land.&nbsp; They ain't making any more
of the stuff."&nbsp; Mark Twain said it too. <a

capital, and demands all grow while land remains fixed.&nbsp; Capital

Jesus
Tax?&nbsp; The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's
forgiveness for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax
injustice. Susan Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and
dedicated United Methodist church goer, thought there was a misprint
when she first read that personal incomes as low as $4,600 for a family
of four were being taxed by the state, while timber owners holding 71%
of the land of Alabama were paying less than $1 per acre in property
taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been no mistake and that
Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country. Her righteous
rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
scene.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a
design of a tax structure this bad," she said in a Tuscaloosa News
story last February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust
and has no moral, ethical leg to stand on. Period."</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes
in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just
4.1 percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of
property taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes
are among the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas,
and do not exempt even the most basic necessities such as food. The
state's 1901 constitution was written primarily by large landholders to
secure their economic interests, consequently property taxes are
extremely light on their holdings. ...</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
"Alabama's tax system is most abusive because it taxes items like milk,
yet offers tax breaks for certain farm products," she said in a
Huntsville Times (3/26/03) interview. "It's also unfair to allow
timberland (which Hamill found out accounts for 71 percent of Alabama
land) to generate only two percent of all state property taxes."<br>
<br>
While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like
"horrific" and "monstrous injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax
reform approach which shifts taxes off of low wage earners and onto
large land owners. Through a combination of her own reasoning, caring
heart, and inherent sense of justice and a thorough investigation of
Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax policy approach which
bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of 19th
century reformer, Henry George.<br>
<br>
Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call
themselves Christians. Hamill challenges them to put their faith into
practice. Her message fell on many already listening ears. The state's
two largest denominations, United Methodists and Southern Baptists, had
passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In 2001 the state's
Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar calls. The
Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council of
Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now
supported by most of the state's religious organizations, according to
Charles Durham, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
<br>
What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama
tax code combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural
bases for economic justice. She quotes chapters and verses which
proclaim that the poor should not be oppressed and that society should
create conditions for their advance. Among her favorites are Jesus'
words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least
of these, you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich
man sent to hell because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and
so all went well." <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Riley's tax plan, inspired in large measure by Hamill's prophetic tax
justice ministry, would bring in an additional $1.2 billion in revenue
while raising the income threshold at which families of four start
paying taxes from the current $4,600 a year to more than $17,000,
scrapping the federal income tax deduction, and increasing exemptions
for dependent children. It would give property tax breaks to small
family farms, while costing millions to the state's 500 or so farms and
timber tracts with more than 2,000 acres each, which includes companies
like Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade, which own hundreds of thousands of
acres.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
"I've spent a lot of time studying the New Testament and it has three
philosophies: love God, love each other, and take care of the least
among you," said Riley (New York Times, 6/10/03, "What Would Jesus Do?
Sock It to Alabama's Corporate Landowners")</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Unfortunately, Alabama voters overwhelmingly voted against the plan on
September 9, 2003. Some said that the poor did not trust the Republican
tax relief plan and the rich had solidly organized against it.
Opponents made hay out of the proposed sales tax increase on
cigarettes, cars and lawn mowers and services like car repairs in a
state where sales taxes already reach 11% in some areas. ...&nbsp;<span

Some of those who advocate starving government are troubled by the
things on which the federal government spends our money.&nbsp; They
seek to fix the problem by cutting off the flow of funds. Many of us
suspect that the kinds of spending they would choose to cut are not things we
see as option.&nbsp;
Here's another point of view:<br>
<br>
Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Leaking.html">Leaking Economic
Value of Communities<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wearing pajamas outdoors in the
winter, one wouldn&#8217;t expect
to retain body heat. Yet, people do try to sustain community while
hemorrhaging its commonwealth. Losing it, residents must work more
than necessary.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When residents import food and
energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While mortgages and interest
elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>The other major
drain, taxes, at about 40% of the average
worker&#8217;s income, usually total more than the value of government
services received. And who receives them? Corporate loggers, miners,
factory farms, and tractor trailers. Lose such subsidies, leveling
the playing field, and local recyclers, family farmers, and freight
haulers could compete. Their success would plug the visible leaks -
imported food, energy, and materials.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small style="font-weight: bold;">While
a community might not be able to command a distant capitol
to turn off the subsidies, a locality may be able to avoid federal
and state taxes. </small><small>...&nbsp; <a
