<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>IV. Applications
to Resource Use</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is only a small step from
charging people for street use and
parks to charging them for renewable and exhaustible resources. <b>If
people who could fish as much as they wanted would deplete fish
stocks excessively, then some form of control over fishing is
beneficial. </b>It is possible in theory to have efficient control
through quotas, though it is difficult to set the quotas properly,
and highly contentious to change them when conditions require a
change. <b>The recognition that the fish are everyone's common
heritage would require that, if there are to be quotas, the quotas be
auctioned, and that if not, then everyone who fishes be required to
pay for fishing according to the loss in the value of fish stocks
that results from fishing.</b> If a fishing resource lies entirely
within a single nation (as in a lake or river), then the recipient of
the fees for fishing should be the polity that includes the resources
(Though the value of the fishing resource would be included in the
calculation of whether the nation was using more than its share of
global natural opportunities.) When the fishing resource is in
international waters, the fees should be shared equally among all
nations in proportion to their populations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that fish are caught in a
river than flows from one nation
into another. How should resource use be managed and accounted for in
that case? The two nations should set a common price for fishing
(unless fishing on one entails a greater resource cost than fishing
in the other). However they divide the revenue from such charges,
their ability to collect the revenue should be included in the
calculation of how their appropriations of natural opportunities
compare with those of other nations. </small><small><b>... </b><span

</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>... </small>Nonpoint
pollution goes right to a chink in the
armor of conventionally trained economists (like myself) who are
overtrained towards becoming protagonists of the price system.&nbsp; To
the skeptical we are "free market freaks": eco&#8209;freaks who are &#8209;nomic
rather than &#8209;logical.&nbsp; Whatever our faults we are zealous, and
carry the conviction of true belief.&nbsp; With the problem at hand,
however, we can't do what we do best, that is call for price signals,
punt, and slip away.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The very name "nonpoint" pollution suggests that
economists see this as just an odd bit of clutter, something
"non&#8209;regular" in their tidy world.&nbsp; Indeed, all pollution was an
exception, an "externality," until recently (at least at my age it
seems so).&nbsp; Then they learned you can meter effluents and tax
them, or trade effluent rights around like private property.&nbsp;
Thenceforth they could fit pollution right into existing models and
ideologies with minimum intellectual strain.&nbsp; They were happy as
Procrustes with a new guest.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>But we can't meter runoff &#8212; how frustrating.&nbsp;</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It comes from areas &#8212; how disorienting.
  </small></li>
  <li><small>Its damages are spread
unequally over other areas, differentially populated &#8212; how
non-homogenous.&nbsp;    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Standard-brand economists are
ill-equipped and
undisposed to face such problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>Conventional price theory has been accused of
mocking physics because it uses some elementary calculus, but if so it
is a poor imitation: it deals with an imaginary world abstracted not
just from friction but from space and time themselves.&nbsp; Space is
relegated to one subdiscipline (location theory) and time to another
(finance), so regular price theorists can spin their webs in purest
abstraction, undistracted by these details.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most price theory is
spaceless.&nbsp;</span> Even location
theory, at least the most common kind, conventionally treats cities as
Euclidean points: the math is simpler that way.&nbsp; Newton could get
away with it explaining planetary motion; students of urban sprawl can
not.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Economists are also
ill-equipped to deal with
ecology.</span>&nbsp; Economists' "externalities" pour into a biosphere
of
interdependencies at least as complex as what economists purport to
understand.&nbsp; Economists are too disposed to underrate the
sensitivity, passion and numbers of Nature's votaries, and the real
economic value of the philosophical values they celebrate.&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>economists are a
notable exception, although they probably
impose more economics on biology than vice versa.&nbsp; But most
economists treat "eco-freaks" as noisy nuisances.&nbsp; In the absence
of a real ecologist I will presume to take their part.&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;
... <br>
<br>
<small>... Damage to lakes and impairment of riparian values is
notorious and needs no laboring here.&nbsp; We see some progress in
protecting inland lakes, but now the oceans themselves are
threatened.&nbsp; There is worsening damage to salt&#8209;water estuaries,
gulfs, bays, and wetlands.&nbsp; Shellfish and finfish supplies are
diminished and contaminated; the littoral is all littered; swimming is
restricted; riparian amenities are impaired (Business Week, October
1987).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Urban invasion of <span style="font-weight: bold;">coastal wetlands</span>
is an aspect of
the problem.&nbsp; Wetlands have served as filters protecting the
ocean: urbanize them and more raw sewage reaches the ocean.&nbsp; Here
again the culprit is not "construction" as such, it is filling.&nbsp;
Cuts in the hills increase runoff; fills in the wetlands reduce
filtering.&nbsp; The combined effect is very bad
news.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... &nbsp;</small><small><big> </big></small><a

<small><br>
</small></small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Meantime, on the Outer
Continental Shelf (<b>OCS</b>), a billion
acres (ten times the area of California) was to be leased before
1984. Before that, major oil firms had about 1/5 of that area under
lease, looking many years or several decades ahead of need. This
helps explain why a recent Alaska sale, an old Naval Petroleum
Reserve (NPR 4), fetched only 14% of the anticipated amount.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today's industry is faced less
with the property tax than the
income tax. Most state property taxes are applied only at low levels
to mineral-bearing lands. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Worse, the
most active leasing today is on
the OCS, outside the tax reach of any state or county, and so exempt
from property taxation.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Federal income tax does reach out to the OCS. Its effect,
however is to redouble the industry's support for the bonus system by
treating bonuses most favorably. </span>The bonus, being a cost of
land
acquisition, might normally not be easily deductible or depreciable.
Oil and gas are exhaustible, however, so the bonus might reasonably
be written off slowly on a unit-of- production basis, or by means of
the depletion allowance where that is still used. In the distinctive
conditions of frontier oil exploration, however, much of the bonuses
paid are deducted before production even begins. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It works like this. In the
normal course of exploration, some five
leaseholds are taken and explored for every one where post-leasing
drilling will show commercially producible hydrocarbons. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The other
four may be "abandoned," which means the lessee formally terminates
the lease. At this time, which the lessee may choose at his tax
convenience, all bonuses previously paid are taken as current
expenses, fully deductible in the year of abandonment. In addition,
all pre-leasing exploration costs that the lessee assigns to the
abandoned leaseholds are expensed also. Thus, before production
begins, the exploring firm may have expensed 80% of its land
acquisition costs. </span><small><font><small><small

1946 President Harry S. Truman, with the stroke of a pen, added
50 percent to the area of the U.S. when he unilaterally extended our
traditional three-mile limit out to 200 miles. <span

territory, outside the sovereignty and tax reach of any state, or
subdivision thereof.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most of our domestic oil and gas
is now produced from the seabed
under this water wilderness. The property is public domain under
federal BLM administration, but firms bid for leaseholds there under
a system that the majors seem to manipulate to their advantage. Even
so, there are some Federal revenues from both lease payments and
corporate taxes. State and local revenues, however; are nil.
</small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Counties may, and often do assess
and tax "possessory interests"
in leaseholds on federal uplands that lie within state boundaries.
They are helpless, however, to tax such property held offshore.</span>
The
property values are huge, and so are the firms that own the
leaseholds. Many firms own tens of millions of acres apiece, areas
larger than whole states. Offshore oil is our largest enclave
protecting rent-bearing lands from property taxation, and any other
form of state or local taxation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some
form of national property tax is called for; or higher lease
payments in lieu of taxes.</span> Perhaps some income tax surcharge is
the
best way, or special federal tax on net proceeds. This paper cannot
enter the thicket of what jurisdiction should have sovereignty to tax
offshore leaseholds, nor how best to levy the tax. The point here is
that no system of resource-based taxation is complete,
philosophically or practically, that leaves this enclave
untouched.&nbsp; <strong>....</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Tax All Natural
Resources Uniformly and Comprehensively </b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Advances in the arts and sciences
keep disclosing new values in
old resources. Owing to institutional lag, these values can grow huge
without finding their way onto the tax rolls. A thoughtless reaction
is, "Bureaucrats want to tax everything!" <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The point is to tax all
natural resources uniformly and comprehensively, to end the lowering
taxes on incomes. productive business, and sales!</span> Land taxation
will
not win wide support, nor will it deserve to, if it is perceived as a
tax focusing on median homeowners, farmers, and merchants, while
exempting oilmen, media tycoons, and timber barons.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition to newly awakened
resources,
many resources long known (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">water</span>)
are held in odd tenures that
have not been recognized as taxable property, although they should
be. Any comprehensive move toward using resource rents for public
revenue must include these varied resources and tenures. I have a
list of 30 or so, too many to treat here. To give a sampling, they

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In tapping
these many varieties of resources and tenures for
public revenues, citizens and their representatives may have to set
priorities. Two practical criteria rise to the top: 
</small></p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>go first for the
big values, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>go for the soft targets.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
biggest values are probably in energy, communications, water,
rights-of-way, zoning and street use.</span> Let's just look at what we
are
learning about <span style="font-weight: bold;">communications</span>.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Knowledge and entertainment
appear
both at top and bottom on man's hierarchy of needs.</span> People
without
even adequate shelter may be seen huddled around tv sets; people in
war, or under totalitarian governments, risk their lives to hear
smuggled broadcasts. People with higher incomes and security equip
themselves with mobile telephones, and call around the world; they
rush to get on the information highway. AT&amp;T was the biggest
non-financial corporation in the world before splitting up.
Newspapers depend on their "wire" services: one of the first Great
American Monopolies was Western Union and its news appendage, AP.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent
FCC auctions have fetched billions of dollars for spectrum
licenses, but this is like selling the badlands after giving away the
beachfronts. </span>The values of extant licenses given away ion the
past,
especially spectrum in top locations, are much higher. AT&amp;T
recently paid $112.5 billion for the McCaw Company's spectrum
licenses, which are a smattering of all that is out there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
licenses should be on the property tax rolls in the jurisdictions
that they cover. </span>The revenue possibilities are staggering.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How
about soft targets? </span>A soft target is any tenure recently
created, in a field that is easy to understand. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>come to
mind. In the last few years governments in Canada and the U.S. have
limited allowable fish hauls by excluding new fishing boats and
imposing quotas on the owners of old ones. This "imposition" amounts
to a gift. Some quotas swiftly rose in value to over $1 million each,
suddenly creating a class society where before there was equal
opportunity. There is now a class of nouveau, instant millionaires
and parlor fisherman who rent out their quotas to working
fishermen.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very
likely it is wise to limit fish catches and avoid the
"tragedy of the commons." It is also necessary to police the waters
and keep out alien interlopers, a dicey business calling for the full
power of a strong national government. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not necessary, however,
to give away the quotas so dearly policed.</span></span> It is obvious
to any
objective observer that the quotas should be sold or (better) leased
to the highest bidder. If the Feds insist on giving them away, states
and localities should class them as taxable property subject to a
high rate. The best time to levy appropriate charges is when quotas
are new, and the injustice of the present dispensation is apparent to
all.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span

catch. Streets and highways are like open ranges, with cars and trucks
instead of cattle and sheep. The revenue potential of charging
motorists for squeezing into crowded streets is staggering. <a

Access to underground &#8220;pools&#8221; of water and petroleum is limited to

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><small>1. Common Property in Land is
Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></strong></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The very people who
gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small></small><br>
<small><small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we
have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></small><br>
<small><small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small></small><br>
<small><small></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries
are another source of value.</span>
In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small></small><br>
<small><small>&nbsp;
</small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not
sell these
licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small></small><br>
<small><small>&nbsp;
</small></small><br>
<small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</small>...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse
subsidies." </span>These are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small></small><small><small></small></small>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></small></li>
  <li><small><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></small></li>
  <li><small><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></small></li>
  <li><small><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived. </small></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. </small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people
to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
</small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;
</small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great
national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
</small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;
</small></small></small><br>
<small><small><small>Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably
foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.&nbsp;

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Applying the
Theory of Justice to Other Connections among Nations</b>
</small><br>
<small>The pre-development rental value of land is only the beginning
of
the natural opportunities to which all persons have equal rights.
Consider fishing in the oceans. If there were so many fish in the
oceans that the removal of some by the fishermen of one nation had no
detectable impact on the opportunities available to the fishermen of
other nations, then there would be no economic scarcity of fish in
the oceans as a natural opportunity, and the value of fish would
represent returns on the labor and capital of the fishermen, along
with some luck. But when fishing by one nation leaves noticeably
fewer fish for the others, the reduction in the value of fish stocks
caused by fishing represents an appropriation by that nation of the
common heritage of all, which needs to be accounted for in
establishing what compensation is needed to achieve an equal division
of natural opportunities. The pie to be divided now consists of the
sum of the pre-development rental value of all land plus the
depletion cost of the fishing that all nations do. A nation is fully
entitled to the proportion of this total represented by the
proportion of its population in total population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The same logic that applies to
fishing applies also to the rent
component of the value of all things--the iron and other metals in
products of all kinds, the gold and other resources in jewelry, the
component of land rent in lumber, etc. Each nation's use of such
resources must be included in the pie to be divided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes rivers flow from one
nation into another. If the
withdrawal of water by the upstream nation reduces the value of the
natural opportunities that are left to the downstream nation, then
this reduction in the value of the downstream opportunities is part
of what the upstream nation appropriates from the common heritage of
all nations. The total value of the available natural opportunities
is maximized while also achieving justice, if all withdrawals of
water by both nations are charged at a price that equates supply and
demand, the money so collected is counted as part of the pie to be
divided, and land is valued according to the rental value it would
have if unimproved,considering the price of water. ...&nbsp; <a

  Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical

<blockquote>
  <p><b>4. Local, state,
          and national applications</b>
  </p>
  <p>Georgist policy can be applied at any level: local, state, or
    national. To some extent it is even applied at a world level,
    through the U.N., with its concept of "common heritage" applied to
    oceanic resources of the deep seabeds. </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist tax policy can also be applied
    at any tax rate, low or
    high. A low rate does a little good; a high rate does a lot of
    good.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In this Century, strenuous efforts
    have been made to box the
    property tax into the local level, where local particularism tends to
    cap the rate</span>. In England, this policy is identified with the
    half-brothers, Austen and Neville Chamberlain. Neville was so
    successful that in 1938 he was forced to face Adolf Hitler without
    any armed support, with the disaster at Munich. In America the
    Federal government last taxed land in the Georgist manner during the
    Civil War. After 1913 it taxed the income from land, but in recent
    years the income tax has degenerated into a payroll tax primarily. In
    tandem with the other payroll tax it has become a primary cause of
    our depressed labor market.</p>
  <p>In 1920, about half of all <b>state</b> revenues (not counting
    local) came from state property taxes. These tended to focus on
    land, rather than capital, much more than now. Both the state and
    Federal governments could tax land again, any time the voters send
    that message. <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a
