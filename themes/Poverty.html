<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. <strong>This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. </strong>There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
  of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I PROPOSE to talk to you tonight
of the Crime of Poverty. I
cannot, in a short time, hope to convince you of much; but the thing
of things I should like to show you is that poverty is a crime. I do
not mean that it is a crime to be poor. Murder is a crime; but it is
not a crime to be murdered; and a man who is in poverty, I look upon,
not as a criminal in himself, so much as the victim of a crime for
which others, as well perhaps as himself, are responsible.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The curse born of poverty is not
confined to the poor alone; it
runs through all classes, even to the very rich. They, too, suffer;
they must suffer; for there cannot be suffering in a community from
which any class can totally escape. The vice, the crime, the
ignorance, the meanness born of poverty, poison, so to speak, the
very air which rich and poor alike must breathe. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Poverty is the mother of
ignorance, the breeder of crime. I
walked down one of your streets this morning, and I saw three men
going along with their hands chained together. I knew for certain
that those men were not rich men; and, although I do not know the
offence for which they were carried in chains through your streets,
this I think I can safely say, that, if you trace it up you will find
it in some way to spring from poverty. Nine tenths of human misery, I
think you will find, if you look, to be due to poverty.&nbsp; ... And
it seems to me clear that the great majority of those who
suffer from poverty are poor not from their own particular faults,
but because of conditions imposed by society at large. Therefore I
hold that poverty is a crime &#8211; not an individual crime, but a
social crime, a crime for which we all, poor as well as rich, are
responsible. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>... Whose
fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make
that terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and
the necessity of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of
society; that it is the fault of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The
man who would bring cholera to this country, or the man who, having
the power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort to do so,
would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty
kills more people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at
the death statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come
quickest; see where it is that the little children die like
flies &#8211; it is in the poorer quarters. And the man who looks with
careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence, the man who does
not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty of a
crime.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If poverty is appointed by the
power which is above us all, then
it is no crime; but if poverty is unnecessary, then it is a crime for
which society is responsible and for which society must suffer. I
hold, and I think no one who looks at the facts can fail to see, that
poverty is utterly unnecessary. It is not by the decree of the
Almighty, but it is because of our own injustice, our own
selfishness, our own ignorance, that this scourge, worse than any
pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing want and suffering and
degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies. Look over the world,
in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation. In every civilised
country under the sun you will find men and women whose condition is
worse than that of the savage: men and women and little children with
whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange. Even in this
new city of yours with virgin soil around you, you have had this
winter to institute a relief society. Your roads have been filled
with tramps, fifteen, I am told, at one time taking shelter in a
round-house here. As here, so everywhere; and poverty is deepest
where wealth most abounds. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What more unnatural than this?
There is nothing in nature like
this poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see
one species destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not
feed on their own kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying
plenty, all creatures of that kind share it. No man, I think, ever
saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few were fat and the great majority
lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of which two or three were
swimming in grease and the others all skin and bone. Nor in savage
life is there anything like the poverty that festers in our
civilisation. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a rude state of society there
are seasons of want, seasons
when people starve; but they are seasons when the earth has refused
to yield her increase, when the rain has not fallen from the heavens,
or when the land has been swept by some foe &#8211; not when there is
plenty. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And yet the peculiar
characteristic of this modern poverty of
ours is that it is deepest where wealth most abounds.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, today, while over the
civilised world there is so much
distress, so much want, what is the cry that goes up? What is the
current explanation of the hard times? Overproduction! There are so
many clothes that men must go ragged, so much coal that in the bitter
winters people have to shiver, such over-filled granaries that people
actually die by starvation! Want due to over-production! Was a
greater absurdity ever uttered? How can there be over-production till
all have enough? It is not over-production; it is unjust
distribution.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here is a broad general fact
that is asserted by all who have
investigated the question, by such men as Hallam, the historian, and
Professor Thorold Rogers, who has made a study of the history of
prices as they were five centuries ago. When all the productive arts
were in the most primitive state, when the most prolific of our
modern vegetables had not been introduced, when the breeds of cattle
were small and poor, when there were hardly any roads and
transportation was exceedingly difficult, when all manufacturing was
done by hand &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;">in that rude time the
condition of the labourers of
England was far better than it is today.</span> In those rude times no
man
need fear want save when actual famine came, and owing to the
difficulties of transportation the plenty of one district could not
relieve the scarcity of another. Save in such times, no man need fear
want. Pauperism, such as exists in modern times, was absolutely
unknown. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Everyone, save the
physically disabled, could make a living,
and the poorest lived in rude plenty.</span> But perhaps the most
astonishing fact brought to light by this investigation is that at
that time, under those conditions in those "dark ages," as
we call them, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the working day was
only eight hours.</span> While with all
our modern inventions and improvements, our working classes have been
agitating and struggling in vain to get the working day reduced to
eight hours.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Why, in the rudest state of
society in the most primitive state of the arts the labour of the
natural bread-winner will suffice to provide a living for himself and
for those who are dependent upon him. Amid all our inventions there
are large bodies of men who cannot do this. What is the most
astonishing thing in our civilisation? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why,
the most astonishing
thing to those Sioux chiefs who were recently brought from the Far
West and taken through our manufacturing cities in the East, was</span>
not
the marvellous inventions that enabled machinery to act almost as if
it had intellect; it was not the growth of our cities; it was not the
speed with which the railway car whirled along; it was not the
telegraph or the telephone that most astonished them; but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the fact
that amid this marvellous development of productive power they found
little children at work.</span> And astonishing that ought to be to us;
a
most astounding thing!</small><br>
<br>
<small> Talk about improvement in the condition of the working classes,
when the facts are that a larger and larger proportion of women and
children are forced to toil.&nbsp; ... Such facts
are appalling; they mean that the very foundations of the Republic
are being sapped. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The dangerous man
is not the man who tries to
excite discontent; the dangerous man is the man who says that all is
as it ought to be. </span>Such a state of things cannot continue; such
tendencies as we see at work here cannot go on without bringing at
last an overwhelming crash.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b> I say that all this poverty and the ignorance that flows
from
it is unnecessary; I say that there is no natural reason why we
should not all be rich, in the sense, not of having more than each
other, but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in the sense of
all having enough to completely satisfy
all physical wants; of all having enough to get such an easy living
that we could develop the better part of humanity. </span></b>There is
no
reason why wealth should not be so abundant, that no one should think
of such a thing as little children at work, or a woman compelled to a
toil that nature never intended her to perform; wealth so abundant
that there would be no cause for that harassing fear that sometimes
paralyses even those who are not considered "the poor," the
fear that every man of us has probably felt, that if sickness should
smite him, or if he should be taken away, those whom he loves better
than his life would become charges upon charity. "Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin." I believe that in a really Christian community, in a
society that honoured not with the lips but with the act, the
doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion to worry about
physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There is
enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad struggle, we
trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all;
trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other. </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>There is a cause for this poverty; and, if you trace it down,
you will find its root in a primary injustice. Look over the world
today&#8212;poverty everywhere. The cause must be a common one. You
cannot attribute it to the tariff, or to the form of government, or
to this thing or to that in which nations differ; because, as deep
poverty is common to them all the cause that produces it must be a
common cause. What is that common cause? There is one sufficient
cause that is common to all nations; and that is the appropriation as
the property of some of that natural element on which and from which
all must live. ...</b></small><br>
<br>
<small>... Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paying some other human creature for the privilege. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I do not mean to say that even
after you had set right this
fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this
I do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of
all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you
please, reform as you may, <b>you never can get rid of wide-spread
poverty so long as the element on which and from which all men must
live is made the private property of some men. It is utterly
impossible. Reform government &#8212; get taxes down to the
minimum &#8212; build railroads; institute co-operative stores; divide
profits, if you choose, between employers and employed-and what will
be the result? The result will be that the land will increase in
value &#8212; that will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else.
Experience shows this. Do not all improvements simply increase the
value of land &#8212; the price that some must pay others for the
privilege of living? </b>... <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The comments made on that
meeting and on the institution of this Society are suggestive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We are told, in the first place, by the
newspapers, that you cannot abolish poverty because there is not wealth
enough to go around. </span>We are told that if all the wealth of the
United States were divided up there would only be some eight hundred
dollars apiece. Well, if that is the case, all the more monstrous is
the injustice which today gives some people millions and tens of
millions, and even hundreds of millions. If there really is so little,
then the more injustice in these great fortunes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But we do not propose to
abolish poverty by dividing up wealth.</span> We propose to abolish
poverty by setting at work that vast army of men &#8212; estimated last year
to amount in this country alone to one million &#8212; that vast army of men
only anxious to create wealth, but who are now, by a system which
permits dogs-in-the-manger to monopolize God&#8217;s bounty, deprived of the
opportunity to toil.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Then, again, they tell us you cannot abolish poverty, because
poverty always has existed. Well, if poverty always has existed, all
the more need for our moving for its abolition. It has existed long
enough. We ought to be tired of it; let us get rid of it. But I deny
that poverty, such poverty as we see on earth today, always has
existed. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

<br>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The poverty amid wealth and the
seething discontent foreboding civil strife that characterise our
civilisation of today are the inevitable results of our rejection of
God&#8217;s beneficence, of our ignoring of His intent. Were we to follow His
clear, simple rule of right &#8211; leaving scrupulously to the individual
all that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the
value that attaches to land by the growth of the community &#8211; not merely
could evil modes of raising public revenue be dispensed with, but all
men would be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the
bounty of their Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert
their labor and to enjoy its fruits.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Then, without drastic restrictive measures, the forestalling of
land would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only
security for the permanence of its use, and there would be no object
for anyone to get land or to keep land except for use; nor would his
possession of better land than others had confer any unjust advantage
on him, or unjust deprivation on them, since the equivalent of the
advantage would be taken by the State for the benefit of all. <strong>... </strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So long as private property in
land continues &#8211; so long as
some men are treated as owners of the earth, and other men live on it
only by their sufferance &#8211; human wisdom can devise no means by which
the evils of our present condition may be avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Could even the wisdom of God do
so? How could He? Should He
infuse new vigour into the sunlight, new virtue into the air; new
fertility into the soil, would not all this new bounty go to the owners
of the land?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Should He open the minds of men to
the possibilities of new
substances, new adjustments, new powers, would this do any more to
relieve poverty than steam, electricity and all the numberless
discoveries and inventions of our time have done?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or, if He were to send down from
the heavens above or cause to
gush up from the subterranean depths, food, clothing &#8211; all the things
that satisfy man&#8217;s material desires to whom under our laws would all
these belong? Would not this increase and extension of His bounty
merely enable the privileged class more riotously to roll in wealth,
and bring the disinherited class to more widespread pauperism?<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>It is assumed that there are in the natural order two classes,
the rich and the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.
It is true that there are differences in capacity, in diligence, in
health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor.
The natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not
greater than are natural differences in stature. But while it is only
by selecting giants and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as
others, yet in the difference between rich and poor that exists today
we find some men richer than others by the thousand-fold and the
million-fold! </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nowhere do these differences
between wealth and poverty coincide with differences in individual
powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and poor is the
difference between those who hold the toll gates and those who pay
toll; between tribute receivers and tribute yielders.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>To assume that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are
naturally poor is to ignore the fact that labor is the producer of
wealth, and to attribute to the Natural Law of the Creator an injustice
that comes from man&#8217;s impious violation of His benevolent intention.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the rudest stage of the arts
it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn a
living. With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be
possible for all to earn much more. </span>And so, to say that poverty
is no disgrace, is to convey an unreasonable implication; since, in a
condition of social justice, it would, except where sought from
religious motives or imposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply
recklessness or laziness.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
worst evil of poverty is not in the want of material
things, but in the stunting and distortion of the higher qualities.</span>
So,
in another way, the possession of unearned wealth stunts and distorts
what is noblest in man.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The evil is not in wealth itself &#8211;
in its command over
material things: it is in the possession of wealth while others are
steeped in poverty; in being raised above touch with the life of
humanity; from its work and its struggles, its hopes and its fears, and
the kind sympathies and generous acts that strengthen faith in man and
trust in God!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>God&#8217;s commands cannot be evaded
with impunity. If it be His
command that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must
suffer. And they do!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>See the utter vacancy of the lives
of those who live for
pleasure; see the vices bred in a class who, surrounded by poverty, are
sated with wealth; see the pessimism that grows among them; see that
terrible punishment of ennui, of which the poor know so little that
they cannot understand it! <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the unduly
rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is
the soul-destroying quality of riches but the reflex of the want that
embrutes and degrades. The real evil lies in the injustice from which
unnatural possession and unnatural deprivation both spring.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This injustice can hardly be
charged on individuals or
classes. The existence of private property in land is a great social
wrong from which society at large suffers, and of which the very rich
and the very poor are alike victims, though at the opposite extremes.
Seeing this, if seems like a violation of Christian charity to speak of
the rich as though they individually were responsible for the
sufferings of the poor. Yet many do this while at the same time
insisting that land monopoly, the cause of monstrous wealth and
degrading poverty, shall not be touched....&nbsp;<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Come into the coalfields of
Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands and thousands of
miners unable to work, either locked out by their employers, or
striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages being cut down
a little more.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Why should there be such a struggle? Why don't these men go to
work and take coal for themselves? Not because there is not coal land
enough in those mining districts. The parts that are worked are small
as compared to the whole coal deposits. The land is not all used, but
it is all owned, and before the men who would like to go to work can
get the opportunity to work the raw material, they must pay to its
owner thousands of dollars per acre for land that is only nominally
taxed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Go West, find people filing along, crowding around every Indian
reservation that is about to be opened; travelling through unused and
half-used land in order to get an opportunity to settle &#8212; like men
swimming a river in order to get a drink. Come to this State, ride
through your great valleys, see those vast expanses, only dotted here
and there by a house, without a tree; those great ranches, cultivated
as they are cultivated by blanket men, who have a little work in
ploughing time, and some more work in reaping time, and who then, after
being fed almost like animals, and sheltered worse than valuable
animals are sheltered, are forced to tramp through the State. It is the
artificial scarcity of natural opportunities. Is there any wonder that
under this treatment of the land all over the civilised world there
should he want and destitution? Aye, and suffering &#8212; degradation worse
in many cases than anything known among savages, among the great masses
of the people.</small><br>
<br>
<small>How could it be otherwise in a world like this world, tenanted
by land animals, such as men are? How could the Creator, so long as our
laws are what they are &#8212; how could He, himself, relieve it? Suppose
that in answer to the prayers that ascend for the relief of poverty,
the Almighty were to rain down wealth from heaven, or cause it to spout
tip from the bowels of the earth. Who, under our present system, would
own it? The landowner. There would be no benefit to labour. Consider,
conceive any kind of a world your imagination will permit. Conceive of
heaven itself, which, from the very necessities of our minds, we cannot
otherwise think of than as having an expansion of space &#8212; what would be
the result in heaven itself, if the people who should first get to
heaven were to parcel it out in big tracts among themselves?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Oh, the wickedness of it; oh, the blasphemy of it! Worse than
atheists are those so-called Christians who by implication, if not by
direct statement, attribute to the God they call on us to worship, the

suffering which today exists in the very centres of our

</small></a><small>(1883)</small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Can Anyone Be Rich?</b>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>The comfortable theory that it is in the nature of things that
some should be poor and some should be rich, and that the gross and
constantly increasing inequalities in the distribution of wealth
imply no fault in our institutions, pervades our literature, and is
taught in the press, in the church, in school and in college. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is a free country, we are
told -- every man has a vote and
every man has a chance. The laborer's son may become President; poor
boys of to-day will be millionaires thirty or forty years from now,
and the millionaire's grandchildren will probably be poor. What more
can be asked? If a man has energy, industry, prudence and foresight,
he may win his way to great wealth. If he has not the ability to do
this he must not complain of those who have. If some enjoy much and
do little, it is because they, or their parents, possessed superior
qualities which enabled, them to "acquire property" or "make money."
If others must work hard and get little, it is because they have not
yet got their start, because they are ignorant, shiftless, unwilling
to practise that economy necessary for the first accumulation of
capital; or because their fathers were wanting in these respects. The
inequalities in condition result from the inequalities of human
nature, from the difference in the powers and capacities of different
men. If one has to toil ten or twelve hours a day for a few hundred
dollars a year, while another, doing little or no hard work, gets an
income of many thousands, it is because all that the former
contributes to the augmentation of the common stock of wealth is
little more than the mere force of his muscles. He can expect little
more than the animal, because he brings into play little more than
animal powers. He is but a private in the ranks of the great army of
industry, who has but to stand still or march, as he is bid. The
other is the organizer, the general, who guides and wields the whole
great machine, who must think, plan and provide; and his larger
income is only commensurate with the far higher and rarer powers
which he exercises, and the far greater importance of the function he
fulfils. Shall not education have its reward, and skill its payment?
What incentive would there be to the toil needed to learn to do
anything well were great prizes not to be gained by those who learn
to excel? It would not merely be gross injustice to refuse a Raphael
or a Rubens more than a housepainter, but it would prevent the
development of great painters. To destroy inequalities in condition
would be to destroy the incentive to progress. To quarrel with them
is to quarrel with the laws of nature. We might as well rail against
the length of the days or the phases of the moon; complain that there
are valleys and mountains; zones of tropical heat and regions of
eternal ice. And were we by violent measures to divide wealth
equally, we should accomplish nothing but harm; in a little while
there would be inequalities as great as before. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This, in substance, is the
teaching which we constantly hear.
It is accepted by some because it is flattering to their vanity, in
accordance with their interests or pleasing to their hope; by others,
because it is dinned into their ears. Like all false theories that
obtain wide acceptance, it contains much truth. But it is truth
isolated from other truth or alloyed with falsehood.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am not denouncing the rich, nor
seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear

on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital
is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely

constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. <span

<p><a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George, a themed collection of
    excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>FIVE centuries ago the wealth-producing power of England, man for man, was
    small indeed compared with what it is now. Not merely were all the great
    inventions and discoveries which since the Introduction of steam have revolutionized
    mechanical industry then undreamed of, but even agriculture was far ruder
    and less productive. Artificial grasses had not been discovered. The potato,
    the carrot, the turnip, the beet, and many other plants and vegetables which
    the farmer now finds most prolific, had not been introduced. The advantages
    which ensue from rotation of crops were unknown. Agricultural implements
    consisted of the spade, the sickle, the flail, the rude plow and the harrow.
    Cattle had not been bred to more than one-half the size they average now,
    and sheep did not yield half the fleece. Roads, where there were roads, were
    extremely bad, wheel vehicles scarce and rude, and places a hundred miles
    from each other were, in difficulties of transportation, practically as far
    apart as London and Hong Kong, or San Francisco and New York, are now. <br>
  <br>
Yet patient students of those times tell us that the condition of the English
laborer was not only relatively, but absolutely better in those rude times than
it is in England today, after five centuries of advance in the productive arts.
They tell us that the workingman did not work so hard as he does now, and lived
better; that he was exempt from the harassing dread of being forced by loss of
employment to want and beggary, or of leaving a family that must apply to charity
to avoid I starvation. Pauperism as it prevails in the rich England of the nineteenth
century was in the far poorer England of the fourteenth century absolutely unknown.
Medicine was empirical and superstitious, sanitary regulations and precautions
were all but unknown. There were frequently plague and occasionally famine, for,
owing to the difficulties of transportation, the scarcity of one district could
not "be relieved by the plenty of another. But men did not as they do now, starve
in the midst of abundance; and what is perhaps the most significant fact of all
is that not only were women and children not worked as they are today, but the
eight-hour system, which even the working classes of the United States, with
all the profusion of labor-saving machinery and appliances have not yet attained,
was then the common system! &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Savage and the Modern Workman<a name="Savage"></a> </span><br>
  <br>
THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each member
is capable of an independent life. He can build his own habitation, hew out or
stitch together his own canoe, make his own clothing, manufacture his own weapons,
snares, tools and ornaments. He has all the knowledge of nature possessed by
his tribe &#8212; knows what vegetable productions are fit for food, and where
they maybe found; knows the habits and resorts of beasts, birds, fishes and insects;
can pilot himself by the sun or the stars, by the turning of blossoms or the
mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable of supplying all his wants. He may
be cut off from his fellows and still live; and thus possesses an independent
power which makes him a free contracting party in his relations to the community
of which he is a member. <br>
  <br>
Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized society,
whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but the infinitesimal
part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of things that constitute the wealth
of society and go to supply even the most primitive wants; who not only cannot
make even the tools required for his work, but often works with tools that he
does not own, and can never hope to own. Compelled to even closer and more continuous
labor than the savage, and gaining by it no more than the savage gets &#8212; the
mere necessaries of life &#8212; he loses the independence of the savage. He
is not only unable to apply his own powers to the direct satisfaction of his
own wants, but, without the concurrence of many others, he is unable to apply
them indirectly to the satisfaction of his wants. He is a mere link in an enormous
chain of producers and consumers, helpless to separate himself, and helpless
to move, except as they move. The worse his position in society, the more dependent
is he on society; the more utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself.
The very power of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes
from his own control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions of others,
or by general causes over which he has no more influence than he has over the
motions of the solar system. The primeval curse comes to be looked upon as a
boon, and men think, and talk, and clamor, and legislate as though monotonous
manual labor in itself were a good and not an evil, an end and not a means. Under
such circumstances, the man loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the
godlike power of modifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave, a
machine, a commodity &#8212; a thing, in some respects, lower than the animal. <br>
  <br>
I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas of the
untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or Cooper. I am
conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low and narrow range. I
believe that civilization is not only the natural destiny of man, but the enfranchisement,
elevation, and refinement of all his powers, and think that it is only in such
moods as may lead him to envy the cud-chewing cattle, that a man who is free
to the advantages of civilization could look with regret upon the savage state.
But, nevertheless, I think no one who will open his eyes to the facts, can resist
the conclusion that there are in the heart of our civilization large classes
with whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange. It is my deliberate
opinion that if, standing on the threshold of being, one were given the choice
of entering life as a Terra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux
in the Arctic Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized
country as Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in selecting
the lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of wealth are condemned
to want, suffer all the privations of the savage, without his sense of personal
freedom; they are condemned to more than his narrowness and littleness, without
opportunity for the growth of his rude virtues; if their horizon is wider, it
is but to reveal blessings that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

in Heaven for His bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think,
of its terrible meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child,
thankful for that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard?
If not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him that
a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths of the
sea? &#8212; <em>The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll), The

WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries we regard
it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we take it as a
matter of course that even in our highest civilization large classes should want
the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority should only get a poor
and pinched living by the hardest toil.&nbsp; There are professors of political
economy who teach that this condition of things is the result of social laws
of which it is idle to complain!&nbsp; There are ministers of religion who preach
that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful Creator intended for
His children! If an architect were to build a theater so that not more than one-tenth
of the audience could see and hear, we should call him a bungler and a botcher.
If a man were to give a feast and provide so little food that nine-tenths of
his guests must go away hungry, we should call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed
are we to poverty, that even the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell
us that the great Architect of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature
testifies, has made such a botch job of this world that the vast majority of
the human creatures whom He has called into it are condemned by the conditions
he has imposed to want, suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity
for the development of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard
struggle to merely live! &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp08.html">Social
Problems &#8212; Chapter 8: That We All Might Be Rich</a></p>
  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

  hopeless poverty, that crushes manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even
  childhood of its innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven
  by a force which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The
  Boston collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may commiserate
  their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of competition, and
  cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange is not governed by
  sentiment. And so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who receive
  the earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is the inexorable
  laws of supply and demand, a power with which the individual can no more quarrel
  or dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem to press down the lower
  classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must result in
slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed for all.
. . . Private ownership of land is the nether millstone. Material progress is
the upper millstone. Between them; with an increasing pressure, the working classes
are being ground. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html">Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212;</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html"> Book

  <p> IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in the pressure
    of population against subsistence that an explanation of the unequal development
    of our civilization is to be found. The great cause of inequality in the
    distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership
    of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social,
    the political and, consequently, the intellectual and moral condition of
    a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse
    upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor
    must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products
    of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces
    of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products. On the land
    we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the
    soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

  THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are now perplexing
  the world. It is not that material progress is not in itself a good, it is
  not that nature has called into being children for whom she has failed to provide;
  it is not that the Creator has left on natural laws a taint of injustice at
  which even the human mind revolts, that material progress brings such bitter
  fruits. That amid our highest civilization men faint and die with want is not
  due to the niggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,
  poverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase of population
  and industrial development; they only follow increase of population and industrial
  development because land is treated as private property &#8212; they are the
  direct and necessary results of the violation of the supreme law of justice,
  involved in giving to some men the exclusive possession of that which nature
  provides for all men. &#8212;<em> <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>LABOR may be likened to a man who as he carries home his earnings is waylaid
    by a series of robbers. One demands this much, and another that much, but
    last of all stands one who demands all that is left, save just enough to
    enable the victim to maintain life and come forth next day to work. So long
    as this last robber remains, what will it benefit such a man to drive off
    any or all of the other robbers? <br>
    <br>
Such is the situation of labor today throughout the civilized world. And the
robber that takes all that is left, is private property in land. Improvement,
no matter how great, and reform, no matter how beneficial in itself, cannot help
that class who, deprived of all right to the use of the material elements, have
only the power to labor &#8212; a power as useless in itself as a sail without
wind, a pump without water, or a saddle without a horse. &#8212; <em>Protection

Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>while
productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth and the
field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to make wages what
justice commands they should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership. Nothing else

          MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would
            be hard to find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while
            the general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the
            capitalist. So
  true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to
            put all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely
            reduce all great
  fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
  who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest
            landowner in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation
            would largely reduce his
  enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income
            from them, and doubtless much personal property in various other
            shapes. He would
  still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
  society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
  THE existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
  society at large suffers and of which the very rich and the very poor are alike
  victims, though at the opposite extremes. <br>
            <br>
          Seeing this, it seems to us like a violation of Christian charity
              to speak of the rich as though they individually were responsible
              for the sufferings of the
  poor. Yet, while you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth
              and degrading poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with
              a disfiguring and
  dangerous excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove
  it. Another insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds
  up the poor victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right- ? &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

          </span> THE evil is not in wealth in itself &#8212; in
                          its command over material things; it is in the possession
                          of wealth while others
              are steeped in poverty; in being raised above touch with the life
              of humanity, from its work and its struggles, its hopes and its
                          fears, and above all, from the love that sweetens life,
                          and the kindly sympathies
              and generous acts that strengthen faith in man and trust in God.
              Consider how the rich see the meaner side of human nature; how
                          they are surrounded by flatterers and sycophants; how
                          they find ready
              instruments not only to gratify vicious impulses, but to prompt
                          and stimulate them; how they must constantly be on
                          guard lest they be
              swindled; how often they must suspect an ulterior motive behind
                          kindly deed or friendly word; how, if they try to be
                          generous, they are
              beset by shameless beggars and scheming impostors; how often the
              family affections are chilled for them, and their deaths anticipated
              with the ill-concealed joy of expectant possession. The worst evil
              of poverty is not in the want of material things, but in the stunting
              and distortion of the higher qualities. So, though in another way,
              the possession of unearned wealth likewise stunts and distorts
                          what is noblest in man. <br>
            <br>
          God's commands cannot be evaded with impunity. If it be God's command
              that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must suffer.

  <p>IT seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least no one would take the trouble
to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle of
men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for the sake of
dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society
where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration
with which the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches, whoever
would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked upon as we would
now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen hats, or walk around
in the hot sun with an overcoat on. When everyone is sure of being able to get
enough, no one will care to make a packhorse of himself. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html"> &#8212; Book

MEN instinctively admire virtue and truth, but the sting of want and the fear
of want make them even more strongly admire the rich and sympathize with the
fortunate. It is well to be honest and just, and men will commend it; but he
who by fraud and injustice gets him a million dollars will have more respect
and admiration and influence, more eye service and lip service, if not heart
service, than he who refuses it. The one may have his reward in the future; he
may know that his name is writ in the Book of Life, and that for him is the white
robe and the palm branch of the victor against temptation; but the other has
his reward in the present. His name is writ in the list of "our substantial citizens;" he
has the courtship of men and the flattery of women; the best pew in the church
and the personal regard of the eloquent clergyman, who in the name of Christ
preaches the Gospel of Dives, and tones down into a meaningless flower of. eastern
speech the stern metaphor of the camel and the needle's eye. He may be a patron
of arts, a Maecenas to men of letters; may profit by the converse of the intelligent,
and be polished by the attrition of the refined. His alms may feed the poor,
and help the struggling, and bring sunshine into desolate places; and noble public
institutions commemorate, after he is gone, his name and his fame. It is not
in the guise of a hideous monster, with horns and tail, that Satan tempts the
children of men, but as an angel of light. His promises are not alone of the
kingdoms of the world, but of mental and moral principalities and powers. He
appeals not only to the animal appetites, but to the cravings that stir in man
because he is more than an animal. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> Book

"THE poor ye have always with you." If ever a scripture has been wrested to the
devil's service, this is that scripture. How often have these words been distorted
from their obvious meaning to soothe conscience into acquiescence in human misery
  and degradation &#8212; to bolster that blasphemy, the very negation and denial
  of Christ's teachings, that the All Wise and Most Merciful, the Infinite Father,
  has decreed that so many of His creatures must be poor&nbsp; in order that others
  of His creatures to whom He wills the good things of life should enjoy the please
  and virtue of doling out alms!&nbsp; "The poor ye have always with you," said
  Christ; but all His teachings supply the limitation, "until the coming of the
  Kingdom."&nbsp; In that kingdom of God <span style="font-style: italic;">on earth</span>,
  that kingdom of justice and love for which He taught His followers to strive

          WE naturally despise poverty; and it is reasonable that we should.
              I do not say &#8212; I
  distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people who are poor are poor always
  from their own fault, or even in most cases; but it ought to be so. If any
  good man or woman had the power to create a world, it would be a sort of a
  world in
  which no one would be poor unless he was lazy or vicious. But that is just
  precisely the kind of a world that this is; that is just precisely, the kind
  of a world
  that the Creator has made. Nature gives to labor, and to labor alone; there
  must be human work before any article of wealth can be produced; and, in a
  natural
  state of things, the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man,
  and he who did not work would be poor. We have so reversed the order of nature,
  that we are accustomed to think of a working-man as a poor man. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The

    recurring periods of &quot;hard times&quot;33 are like epidemics of a virulent
    disease, which excite even the most contented to ask if they may not be the
    next victims. Its spasms of violence threaten society with anarchy on the

        is necessary to make it effective. But organized charity as a cherished
        social institution is a different thing. It is not love, nor is it inspired
        by love; it is simply sanctified selfishness, at the bottom of which

        living, and decently burying the dead. But what should we say of those
        who, when some one proposed to fill up the hole to prevent further suffering,
        should say, &quot;Oh, you mustn't fill up that hole! Whatever in the

        society from its very foundations, lifting the very poorest above the
        possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from anxiety for the material
        needs of life ... And out of these bounteous material conditions he would

        becoming evident that the enormous increase in productive power which
        has marked the present century and is still going on with accelerating
        ratio, has no tendency to extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens
        of those compelled to toil. It simply widens the gulf between <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives
        and Lazarus</a>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The
        march of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century
        ago the boldest imagination could not have dreamed. But in factories
        where labor-saving machinery has reached its most wonderful development,
        little children are at work; wherever the new forces are anything like
        fully utilized, large classes are maintained by charity or live on the
        verge of recourse to it; amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men
        die of starvation, and puny infant suckle dry breasts; while everywhere
        the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the force of the fear
        of want. &#8212;<em> Progress and Poverty, Introduction.</em></font></p>

  <p>That much of our poverty is involuntary may be proved, if proof be necessary,
    by the magnitude of charitable work that aims to help only the &quot;deserving
    poor&quot;; and as to undeserving cases &#8212; the cases of voluntary poverty &#8212; who
    can say but that they, if not due to birth and training in the environs of
    degraded poverty, 35 are the despairing culminations of long-continued struggles
    for respectable independence? 36 How can we know that they are not essentially
    like the rest &#8212; involuntary and deserving? It is a profound distinction
    that a clever writer of fiction 37 makes when he speaks of &quot;the hopeful
    and the hopeless poor.&quot; There is, indeed, little difference between
    voluntary and involuntary poverty, between the &quot;deserving&quot; and
    the &quot;undeserving&quot; poor, except that the &quot;deserving&quot; still
    have hope, while from the &quot;undeserving&quot; all hope, if they ever
    knew any, has gone.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">36. Some years ago a gentleman, now well and favorably
        known in New York public life, told me of a ragged tramp whom he had
        brought, more to gratify a whim perhaps than in any spirit of philanthropy,
        from a neighboring camp of tramps to his house for breakfast. After breakfast
        the host asked his guest, in the course of conversation, why he lived
        the life of a tramp. This in substance was the tramp's reply:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am a mechanic and used to be a good one, though
        not so exceptionally good as to be safe from the competition of the great
        class of average workers. I had a family &#8212; a wife and two children.
        In the hard times of the seventies I lost my job. For a while we lived
        upon our little savings; but sickness came and our savings were used
        up. My wife and children died. Everything was gone but self-respect.
        Then I traveled, looking for work which could not be had at home. I traveled
        afoot; I could afford no other way. For days I hunted for work, begging
        food and sleeping in barns or under trees; but no work could I get. Once
        or twice I was arrested as a vagrant. Then I fell in with a party of
        tramps and with them drifted into the city. Winter came on. I still had
        a desire to regain my old place as a self-respecting man, but work was
        scarce and nothing that I could do could I find to do, except some little
        job now and then which was given to me as pennies are given to beggars.
        I slept mostly in station houses. Part of the time I was undergoing sentence
        for vagrancy. In the spring I tramped again. But now I did not hunt for
        work. My self-respect was gone so completely that I had no ambition to
        regain it. I was a loafer and a jail-bird. I had no family to support,
        and I had found that, barring the question of self-respect, I was about
        as well off as were average workmen. After years of tramping this opinion
        is unchanged. I am always sure of enough to eat and a place to sleep
        in &#8212; not very good often, but good enough. I should not be sure
        of that if I were a workingman. I might lose my job and go hungry rather
        than beg. I might be unable to pay my rent and so be turned upon the
        street. I might marry again and have a family which would be condemned
        to the hard life of the average workingman's family. And as for society,
        why, I have society. Tramps are good fellows &#8212; sociable fellows,
        bright fellows many of them. Life as a tramp is not half bad when you
        compare it with the workingman's life, leaving out the question of self-respect,
        of course. You must leave that out. No man can be a tramp for good until
        he loses that. But a period of hard times makes many a chap lose it.
        And as I have lost it I would rather be a tramp than a workingman. I
        have tried both. By the way, Mr. &#8212;&#8212;, this is a very good
        cigar &#8212; this brand of yours. I seldom smoke much better cigars.&quot;</font></p>

        false; they probably were. But so were the facts in detail of Bunyan's &quot;Pilgrim's
        Progress.&quot; There is, however, a distinction between <em>fact</em> and <em>truth</em>,
        and no matter how false the man's facts may have been, his story, like
        Bunyan's, was essentially true. Much of the poverty that upon the surface
        seems to be voluntary and undeserving comes from a growing feeling among
        those who work hardest that, as Cowper describes it, they are </font></p>

        far behind, turned his canoe toward the shore and dropped out of the
        race. Was it because he was too lazy to paddle? Not at all. It was because
        he realized the hopelessness of the effort.</font></p>

  <p>But it is not alone to objects of charity that the question of poverty calls
    our attention. There is a keener poverty, which pinches and goes hungry,
    but is beyond the reach of charity because it never complains. And back of
    all and over all is fear of poverty, which chills the best instincts of men
    of every social grade, from recipients of out-door relief who dread the poorhouse,
    to millionaires who dread the possibility of poverty for their children if
    not for themselves.38</p>

  <p>It is poverty and fear of poverty that prompt men of honest instincts to
    steal, to bribe, to take bribes, to oppress, either under color of law or
    against law, and &#8212; what is worst than all, because it is not merely
    a depraved act, but a course of conduct that implies a state of depravity &#8212; to
    enlist their talents in crusades against their convictions. 39 Our civilization
    cannot long resist such enemies as poverty and fear of poverty breed; to
    intelligent observers it already seems to yield. 40</p>

    <p><font size="-1">39. &quot;From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify
        which men tread everything pure and noble under their feet; to which
        they sacrifice all the higher possibilities of life; which converts civility
        into a hollow pretense, patriotism into a sham, and religion into hypocrisy;
        which makes so much of civilized existence an Ishmaelitish warfare, of
        which the weapons are cunning and fraud? Does it not spring from the
        existence of want? Carlyle somewhere says that poverty is the hell of
        which the modern Englishman is most afraid. And he is right. Poverty
        is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath civilized society.
        And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when the
        wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest
        pain is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame,
        degradation; the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and
        mental nature as with hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses
        and the sweetest affections; the wrenching of the most vital nerves.
        You love your wife, you love your children; but would it not be easier
        to see them die than to see them reduced to the pinch of want in which
        large classes in every highly civilized community live? ... From this
        hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make every effort
        to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and self-gratification
        combine nobler feelings, and love as well as fear urges in the struggle.
        Many a man does a mean thing, a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping
        and unjust thing, in the effort to place above want, or the fear of want,
        mother or wife or children.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book

    <p><font size="-1">40. &quot;There is just now a disposition to scoff at
        any implication that we are not in all respects progressing ... Yet it
        is evident that there have been times of decline, just as there have
        been times of advance; and it is further evident that these epochs of
        decline could not at first have been generally recognized.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;He would have been a rash man who, when Augustus
        was changing the Rome of brick to the Rome of marble, when wealth was

        more polished, and literature rising to higher splendors &#8212; he would
        have been a rash man who then would have said that Rome was entering
        her decline. Yet such was the case.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;And whoever will look may see that though our civilization
        is apparently advancing with greater rapidity than ever, the same cause
        which turned Roman progress into retrogression is operating now.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;What has destroyed every previous civilization
        has been the tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth and power.
        This same tendency, operating with increasing force, is observable in
        our civilization today, showing itself in every progressive community,
        and with greater intensity the more progressive the community. ... The
        conditions of social progress, as we have traced the law, are association
        and equality. The general tendency of modern development, since the time
        when we can first discern the gleams of civilization in the darkness
        which followed the fall of the Western Empire, has been toward political
        and legal equality ... This tendency has reached its full expression
        in the American Republic, where political and legal rights are absolutely
        equal ... it is the prevailing tendency, and how soon Europe will be
        completely republican is only a matter of time, or rather of accident.
        The United States are therefore in this respect, the most advanced of
        all the great nations, in a direction in which all are advancing, and
        in the United States we see just how much this tendency to personal and
        political freedom can of itself accomplish. ... It is now ... evident
        that political equality, coexisting with an increasing tendency to the
        unequal distribution of wealth, must ultimately beget either the despotism
        of organized tyranny or the worse despotism of anarchy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;To turn a republican government into a despotism
        the basest and most brutal, it is not necessary formally to change its
        constitution or abandon popular elections. It was centuries after C&aelig;sar
        before the absolute master of the Roman world pretended to rule other
        than by authority of a Senate that trembled before him.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;But forms are nothing when substance has gone, and
        the forms of popular government are those from which the substance of
        freedom may most easily go. Extremes meet, and a government of universal
        suffrage and theoretical equality may, under conditions which impel the
        change, most readily become a despotism. For there despotism advances
        in the name and with the might of the people. ... And when the disparity
        of condition increases, so does universal suffrage make it easy to seize
        the source of power, for the greater is the proportion of power in the
        hands of those who feel no direct interest in the conduct of government;
        who, tortured by want and embruted by poverty, are ready to sell their
        votes to the highest bidder or follow the lead of the most blatant demagogue;
        or who, made bitter by hardships, may even look upon profligate and tyrannous
        government with the satisfaction we may imagine the proletarians and
        slaves of Rome to have felt, as they saw a Caligula or Nero raging among
        the rich patricians. ... Now this transformation of popular government
        into despotism of the vilest and most degrading kind, which must inevitably
        result from the unequal distribution of wealth, is not a thing of the
        far future. It has already begun in the United States, and is rapidly
        going on under our eyes. ... The type of modern growth is the great city.
        Here are to be found the greatest wealth and the deepest poverty. And
        it is here that popular government has most clearly broken down. ...
        In theory we are intense democrats. ... But is there not growing up among
        us a class who have all the power without any of the virtues of aristocracy?
        ... Industry everywhere tends to assume a form in which one is master
        and many serve. And when one is master and the others serve, the one
        will control the others, even in such matters as votes. ... There is
        no mistaking it &#8212; the very foundations of society are being sapped
        before our eyes ... It is shown in greatest force where the inequalities
        in the distribution of wealth are greatest, and it shows itself as they
        increase. ... Though we may not speak it openly, the general faith in
        republican institutions is, where they have reached their fullest development,
        narrowing and weakening. It is no longer that confident belief in republicanism
        as the source of national blessings that it once was. Thoughtful men
        are beginning to see its dangers, without seeing how to escape them;
        are beginning to accept the view of Macaulay and distrust that of Jefferson.
        And the people at large are becoming used to the growing corruption.
        The most ominous political sign in the United States today is the growth
        of a sentiment which either doubts the existence of an honest man in
        public office or looks on him as a fool for not seizing his opportunities.
        That is to say, the people themselves are becoming corrupted. Thus in
        the United States to-day is republican government running the course
        it must inevitably follow under conditions which cause the unequal distribution
        of wealth.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book x, ch. iv.</em></font></p>

  <p>But how is the development of these social enemies to be arrested? Only
    by tracing poverty to its cause, and, having found the cause, deliberately
    removing it. Poverty cannot be traced to its cause, however, without serious
    thought; not mere reading and school study and other tutoring, but <em>thought</em>.
    41 To jump at a conclusion is very likely to jump over the cause, at which
    no class is more apt than the tutored class.42 We must proceed step by step

        sure of one step before building another upon it &#8212; and above all,

        more he began to conclude that the highly educated classes were in public
        affairs rather more conspicuously foolish than anybody else. Mr. Frederic
        thinks that the Tories have since done much to 'breed a suspicion that
        therein Gladstone touched the outskirts of a great and solemn truth.'
        But it needed not the action of the Tories to breed that suspicion. In
        this country as well as in England it is patent to any close observer
        that the highly educated classes, or to speak with more exactness, the
        highly <em>tutored</em> classes, when compared with the common people,
        are in public affairs but little better than fools. The explanation is
        simple. The common people are philosophers unencumbered with useless
        knowledge, who look upon public affairs broadly, and moralists who pry
        beneath the surface of custom and precedent into the heart of public
        questions. The minds of the tutored classes, on the contrary, are dwarfed
        by close attention to particulars to the exclusion of generals, and distorted
        by such false morality as is involved in tutorial notions regarding vested
        rights. &#8212; <em>The Standard</em>, July 27, 1892.</font></p>

  <p><strong>1. THE SOURCE OF WEALTH</strong></p>
  <p>The first demand upon us is to make sure that we know the source of the
    things that satisfy want.43 But it is quite unnecessary to tediously specify
    these and trace them to their origin in detail. In searching for the source
    of one we shall discover the source of all. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">71. Farmers, millers, bakers, ranchers, butchers, fishermen,
      hunters, makers of food-producing implements, food merchants, railroad
      men, sailors, draymen, coal miners, metal miners, builders, bankers who
      by exchanging commercial paper facilitate trade. together with clerks,
      bookkeepers, foremen, journeymen, common laborers, seeking for them instead
      of their seeking for work. To specify the labor that would be profitably
      affected by this demand would involve the cataloguing of all workmen, all
      business men, and all professional men who either directly or indirectly
      are connected with food industries, and the naming of every grade of such
      labor, from the newest apprentice to the largest supervising employer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Would not this be putting an end to &quot;hard times&quot;?
      For what is the most striking manifestation of &quot;hard times&quot;?
      Is it not &quot;scarcity of work&quot;? Is it not that there are more men
      seeking work than there are jobs to do? Certainly it is. And to say that,
      is not to limit &quot;hard times&quot; to hired men. The real trouble with
      the business man when he complains of &quot;hard times&quot; is that people
      do not employ him as much as he expects to be employed. Work is scarce
      with him, just as with those he employs, or as he would phrase it, &quot;business
      is slack.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Let there be ten men and but nine jobs, and you have &quot;hard
      times.&quot; The tenth man will be out of work. He may be a good union
      man who abhors a &quot;scab&quot; and will not take work away from his
      brother workman. So he hunts for a job which does not exist, until all
      his savings are gone. Still he will not be a &quot;scab,&quot; and he suffers
      deprivation. But after a while hunger gets the better of him, and he takes
      one of the nine jobs away from another man by underbidding. He becomes
      a &quot;scab.&quot; And who can blame him? any one would rather be a &quot;scab&quot; than
      a corpse. Then the man who has lost his place becomes a &quot;scab&quot; too,
      and turns out some one else by underbidding. And so it goes again and again

  <p>From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread everything
      pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all the higher possibilities
      of life; which converts civility into a hollow pretense, patriotism into a
      sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which makes so much of civilized existence
      an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which the weapons are cunning and fraud?</p>
  <p>Does it not spring from the existence of want? Carlyle somewhere says that
      poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is most afraid. And he is
      right. Poverty is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath civilized
      society. And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when
      the wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest pain
      is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame, degradation;
      the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and mental nature as with
      hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses and the sweetest affections;
      the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You love your wife, you love your children;
      but would it not be easier to see them die than to see them reduced to the
      pinch of want in which large classes in every highly civilized community live?
      The strongest of animal passions is that with which we cling to life, but it
      is an everyday occurrence in civilized societies for men to put poison to their
      mouths or pistols to their heads from fear of poverty, and for one who does
      this there are probably a hundred who have the desire, but are restrained by
      instinctive shrinking, by religious considerations, or by family ties.</p>
  <p>From this hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make every effort
      to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and self-gratification combine
      nobler feelings, and love as well as fear urges in the struggle. Many a man
      does a mean thing, a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping and unjust thing,
      in the effort to place above want, or the fear of want, mother or wife or children.</p>
  <p>And out of this condition of things arises a public opinion which enlists,
      as an impelling power in the struggle to grasp and to keep, one of the strongest
      perhaps with many men the very strongest springs of human action. The desire
      for approbation, the feeling that urges us to win the respect, admiration,
      or sympathy of our fellows, is instinctive and universal. Distorted sometimes
      into the most abnormal manifestations, it may yet be everywhere perceived.
      It is potent with the veriest savage, as with the most highly cultivated member
      of the most polished society; it shows itself with the first gleam of intelligence,
      and persists to the last breath. It triumphs over the love of ease, over the
      sense of pain, over the dread of death. It dictates the most trivial and the
      most important actions. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/13_Effect_upon_Ideals.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

      14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
      X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. <strong>It shows that the
        evils arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are
        becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt;</strong> that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. <strong>But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men,
        and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely offers
      to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice</strong> &#8212; for,
      so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
      to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
      asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
      ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages.</strong> This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li><strong>poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</strong></li>
    <li><strong> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten</strong>;
      and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain. ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
      abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of
    her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have
    not seen
      her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
      rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as
      well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support
      all growth,
      supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and
      inert mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty
      to mankind.
      It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every
      age the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty
      have
      suffered.</p>
  <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
      national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
  <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
      among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
  <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. <strong>It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
      Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light!</strong> Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.</strong> This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p><strong>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse.</strong> It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe
        forbid it.</strong> Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that
        is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something grander
        than Benevolence, something more
      august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
        to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
        come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays
        on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. </strong>We
        degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would
        have better ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such
        an ulcerous
        ant-hill! It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the
        vice and misery that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers
        upon us
        his gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
        food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while
        we tear and rend each other!</p>
  <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
        enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
        nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
        the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into
        being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air;
        fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
        spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold!
        Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit
        would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the
        material universe could be utilized only through land.</p>
  <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
        know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under our
        very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that
        Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which
        maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made, has
        increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
        of nature had been increased. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
          of mankind. </li>
    <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels the
      lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
    <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
    <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
      of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
      the
          same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
        with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings
        while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few
        are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every page may be read
        the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that
        follows
        injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state
        of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After us the deluge!&quot; Nay;
        the pillars of the State are trembling even now, and the very foundations
        of
        society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The
        struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand,
        if it be
        not already begun.</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying
          the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
      gather for the strife!</p>
  <p><strong>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,
        if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear,<em> the
        forces that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation.</em> </strong>Think
        of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored;
        of the possibilities of which the wondrous inventions of this century give
        us but a hint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> With want destroyed;</li>
    <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
    <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
      jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
    <li> with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
    <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Words fail the thought! <strong>It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
        and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which

    The Problem</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing
    power. The utilization of steam and electricity, the introduction of improved
    processes and labor-saving machinery, the greater subdivision and grander scale
    of production, the wonderful facilitation of exchanges, have multiplied enormously
    the
  effectiveness of labor.</p>
  <p>At the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and it was
    expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the
    condition of the laborer; that the enormous increase in the power of producing
    wealth would make real poverty a thing of the past.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Could a man of the last century--a Franklin or a Priestley--have seen,
          in a vision of the future, the steamship taking the place of the sailing
          vessel, the railroad train of the wagon, the reaping machine of the
      scythe, the threshing machine of the flail;</li>
    <li>could he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience to human
          will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater
      than that of all the men and all the beasts of burden of the earth combined;</li>
    <li>could he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished lumber--into
          doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the touch of a
      human hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are turned out by
      the case
          with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler could have put on a
      sole; the factories where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes cloth
      faster
          than hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out with their
      hand-looms;</li>
    <li>could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and mighty anchors,
          and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the diamond drill cutting
      through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil sparing the whale;</li>
    <li>could he have realized the enormous saving of labor resulting from improved
          facilities of exchange and communication--sheep killed in Australia
      eaten fresh in England and the order given by the London banker in the
      afternoon
          executed in San Francisco in the morning of the same day;</li>
    <li><B><I>could he have conceived of the hundred thousand improvements which
              these only suggest, what would he have inferred as to the social condition
              of mankind?</I></B></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the vision went,
    it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart would have leaped and
    his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height beholds just ahead
    of the thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of rustling woods and the glint
    of laughing waters. Plainly, in the sight of the imagination, he would have
    beheld these new forces elevating society from its very foundations, lifting
    the very poorest above the possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from
    anxiety for the material needs of life; he would have seen these slaves of
    the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse, these muscles
    of iron and sinews of steel making the poorest laborer's life a holiday, in
    which every high quality and noble impulse could have scope to grow.</p>
  <p>And out of these bounteous material conditions he would have seen arising,
    as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden age of which
    mankind have always dreamed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Youth no longer stunted and starved;</li>
    <li>age no longer harried by avarice;</li>
    <li>the child at play with the tiger;</li>
    <li>the man with the muck-rake drinking in the glory of the stars!</li>
    <li>Foul things fled, fierce things tame;</li>
    <li>discord turned to harmony!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For how could there be greed where all had enough? How could the vice, the
    crime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from poverty and the fear
    of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished? Who should crouch where all were
    freemen; who oppress where all were peers?</p>
  <p>More or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these the dreams born
    of the improvements which give this wonderful century its preeminence. They
    have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as to radically change the currents
    of thought, to recast creeds and displace the most fundamental conceptions.
    The haunting visions of higher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor
    and vividness, but their direction has changed--instead of seeing behind the
    faint tinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has decked
    the skies before.</p>
  <p>It is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and that discovery
    upon discovery, and invention after invention, have neither lessened the toil
    of those who most need respite, nor brought plenty to the poor. But there have
    been so many things to which it seemed this failure could be laid, that up
    to our time the new faith has hardly weakened. We have better appreciated the
    difficulties to be overcome; but not the less trusted that the tendency of
    the times was to overcome them.</p>
  <p>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can be no
    mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come complaints;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>of industrial depression;</li>
    <li>of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;</li>
    <li>of capital massed and wasting;</li>
    <li>of pecuniary distress among business men;</li>
    <li>of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All the dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish, that to great
    masses of men are involved in the words "hard times," afflict the world today. <B>This
    state of things, common to communities differing so widely in situation, in
    political institutions, in fiscal and financial systems, in density of population
    and in social organization can hardly be accounted for by local causes.</B></p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is distress where large standing armies are maintained, but there
          is also distress where the standing armies are nominal;</li>
    <li>there is distress where protective tariffs stupidly and wastefully hamper
          trade, but there is also distress where trade is nearly free;</li>
    <li>there is distress where autocratic government yet prevails, but there
      is also distress where political power is wholly in the hands of the people;</li>
    <li>in countries where paper is money, and</li>
    <li>in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Evidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a common cause.</p>
  <p><B>That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we call material
        progress or something closely connected with material progress, becomes more
        than an inference when it is noted that the phenomena we class together and
        speak of as industrial depression, are but intensifications of phenomena
        which always accompany material progress, and which show themselves more
        clearly and strongly as material progress goes on. </B><I>Where the conditions
        to which material progress everywhere tends are most fully realized--that
        is to say, where population is densest, wealth greatest, and the machinery
        of production and exchange most highly developed--we find the deepest poverty,
        the sharpest struggle for existence, and the most enforced idleness.</I></p>
  <p>It is to the newer countries--that is, to the countries where material progress
    is yet in its earlier stages--that laborers emigrate in search of higher wages,
    and capital flows in search of higher interest. It is in the older countries--that
    is to say, the countries where material progress has reached later stages--that
    widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest abundance. Go
    into one of the new communities where Anglo-Saxon vigor is just beginning the
    race of progress;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and inefficient;</li>
    <li>where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to enable any class
          to live in ease and luxury;</li>
    <li>where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth and paper shanty,
          and the richest man is forced to daily work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and though you will find an absence of wealth and all its concomitants, you
    will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there is no destitution. No one
    makes an easy living, nor a very good living; but every one can make a living,
    and no one able and willing to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>
  <p><B>But just as such a community realizes the conditions which all civilized
      communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of material progress--just
      as closer settlement and a more intimate connection with the rest of the
      world, and greater utilization of labor-saving machinery, make possible greater
      economies in production and exchange, and wealth in consequence increases,
      not merely in the aggregate, but in proportion to population--<I>so does
      poverty take a darker aspect</I>.</B> Some get an infinitely better and easier
      living, but others find it hard to get a living at. <A NAME='The "tramp" comes with the loco'></A>The "tramp" comes
      with the locomotive, and alms houses and prisons areas surely the marks of "material
      progress" as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and magnificent churches.
      Upon streets lighted with gas and controlled by uniformed policemen, beggars
      wait for the passer-by, and in the shadow of college, and library, and
      museum, are gathering the more hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom
      Macaulay
      prophesied.</p>
  <p><B>This fact--the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants show themselves
        in communities just as they develop into the conditions towards which material
        progress tends--proves that the social difficulties existing wherever a certain
        stage of progress has been reached, do not arise from local circumstances,
        but are, in some way or another, engendered by progress itself.</B></p>
  <p>And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming evident that <B>the
      enormous increase in productive power which has marked the present century
      and is still going on with accelerating ratio, has no tendency to extirpate
      poverty or to lighten the burdens of those compelled to toil.</B> It simply
      widens the gulf between <A HREF="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives
      and Lazarus</A>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The march
      of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century ago the boldest
      imagination could not have dreamed. But</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in factories where labor-saving machinery has reached its most wonderful
          development, little children are at work;</li>
    <li>wherever the new forces are anything like fully utilized, large classes
          are maintained by charity or live on the verge of recourse to it;</li>
    <li>amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die of starvation, and
      puny infant suckle dry breasts;</li>
    <li>while everywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the
      force of the fear of want.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The promised land flies before us like the mirage. The fruit of the tree of
    knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that crumble at the touch.</p>
  <p>It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of
    comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but these gains are not general. <A NAME="In them the lowest class do not"></A>In
    them the lowest class do not share.* I do not mean that the condition of the
    lowest class has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is nowhere
    any improvement which can be credited to increased productive power. <B>I mean
    that the tendency of what we call material progress is in no wise to improve
    the condition of the lowest class in the essentials of healthy, happy human
    life.</B> Nay, more, that it is to still further depress the condition of the
    lowest class. <B>The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be,
    do not act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped
    and believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and bottom.</B> It
    is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not underneath society, but
    through society. Those who are above the point of separation are elevated,
    but those who are below are crushed down.</p>

    <p>This depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not apparent where
    there has long existed a class just able to live. Where the lowest class barely
    lives, as has been the case for a long time in many parts of Europe, it is
    impossible for it to get any lower, for the next lowest step is out of existence,
    and no tendency to further depression can readily show itself. <B>But in the
    progress of new settlements to the conditions of older communities it may clearly
    be seen that material progress does not merely fail to relieve poverty--it
    actually produces it. In the United States it is clear that squalor and misery,
    and the vices and crimes that spring from them, everywhere increase as the
    village grows to the city, and the march of development brings the advantages
    of the improved methods of production and exchange.</B> It is in the older
    and richer sections of the Union that pauperism and distress among the working
    classes are becoming most painfully apparent. <I>If there is less deep poverty
    in San Francisco than in New York, is it not because San Francisco is yet behind
    New York in all that both cities are striving for? When San Francisco reaches
    the point where New York now is, who can doubt that there will also be ragged
    and barefooted children on her streets?</I></p>
    <p><B>This association of poverty
      with progress is the great enigma of our times</B>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social, and political
          difficulties that perplex the world, and with which statesmanship and
        philanthropy and education grapple in vain.</li>
      <li>From it come the clouds that overhang the future of the most progressive
          and self-reliant nations.</li>
      <li>It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization,
        and which not to answer is to be destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><B>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but
      to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast
      between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and
      cannot be permanent.</B> The reaction must come. The tower leans from its
      foundations, and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate
      men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base
      on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions under
      which men are not fully equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</p>
    <p>All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every quarter painfully
    upon attention, it has not yet received a solution which accounts for all the
    facts and points to any clear and simple remedy. This is shown by the widely
    varying attempts to account for the prevailing depression. They exhibit not
    merely a divergence between vulgar notions and scientific theories, but also
    show that the concurrence which should exist between those who avow the same
    general theories breaks up upon practical questions into an anarchy of opinion.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon high economic authority we have been told that the prevailing
        depression is due to over-consumption;</li>
      <li>upon equally high authority, that it is due to over-production; while</li>
      <li>the wastes of war,</li>
      <li>the extension of railroads,</li>
      <li>the attempts of workmen to keep up wages,</li>
      <li>the demonetization of silver,</li>
      <li>the issues of paper money,</li>
      <li>the increase of labor-saving machinery,</li>
      <li>the opening of shorter avenues to trade, etc., etc.,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are separately pointed out as the cause, by writers of reputation.</p>
    <p>And while professors thus disagree, the ideas</p>
    <ul>
      <li>that there is a necessary conflict between capital and labor,</li>
      <li>that machinery is an evil,</li>
      <li>that competition must be restrained and interest abolished,</li>
      <li>that wealth may be created by the issue of money,</li>
      <li>that it is the duty of government to furnish capital or to furnish
        work,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are rapidly making way among the great body of the people, who keenly feel
    a hurt and are sharply conscious of a wrong. Such ideas, which bring great
    masses of men, the repositories of ultimate political power, under the leadership
    of charlatans and demagogues, are fraught with danger; but they cannot be successfully
    combated until political economy shall give some answer to the great question
    which shall be consistent with all her teachings, and which shall commend itself
    to the perceptions of the great masses of men.</p>
    <p><B>It must be within the province of political economy to give such an answer</B>.
    For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of a certain
    set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of certain phenomena,
    seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the
    physical sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations
    upon firm ground. <B>The premises from which it makes its deductions are truths
    which have the highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which
    we safely base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
    reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion seeks
    the line of least resistance--<I>viz</I>., </B><FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><B><I>that
    men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion</I></B></FONT><B>.</B> Proceeding
    from a basis thus assured, its processes, which consist simply in identification
    and separation, have the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science
    as geometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its conclusions
    by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should be as self-apparent.
    And although in the domain of political economy we cannot test our theories
    by artificially produced combinations or conditions, as may be done in some
    of the other sciences, yet we can apply tests no less conclusive, by comparing
    societies in which different conditions exist, or by, in imagination, separating,
    combining, adding or eliminating forces or factors of known direction.</p>
    <p>I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of political
    economy the great problem I have outlined. <B>I propose to seek the law which
    associates poverty with progress, and increases want with advancing wealth;
    and I believe that in the explanation of this paradox we shall find the explanation
    of those recurring seasons of industrial and commercial paralysis which, viewed
    independent of their relations to more general phenomena, seem so inexplicable.</B> Properly
    commenced and carefully pursued, such an investigation must yield a conclusion
    that will stand every test, and as truth will correlate with all other truth.
    For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause,
    and every fact implies a preceding fact.</p>
    <p>That political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the persistence
    of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which accords with the deep-seated
    perceptions of men;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>that the unquestionable truths which it does teach are unrelated and
        disjointed;</li>
      <li>that it has failed to make the progress in popular thought that truth,
          even when unpleasant, must make;</li>
      <li>that, on the contrary, after a century of cultivation, during which
        it has engrossed the attention some of the most subtle and powerful intellects,
          it should be spurned by the statesman, scouted by the masses, relegated
        in
          the opinion of many educated and thinking men to the rank of a pseudo-science
          in which nothing fixed or can be fixed--must, it seems to me, be due
        not to any inability of the science when properly pursued, but some false
        step
          in its premises, or overlooked factor in its estimates. And as such
        mistakes are generally concealed the respect paid to authority, I propose
        in this
          inquiry take nothing for granted, but to bring even accepted theories
        to the test of first principles, and should they not stand the test,
        to freshly
          interrogate facts in the endeavor to discover their law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I propose to beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to follow
    truth wherever it may lead. Upon us the responsibility of seeking the law,
    for in the very heart of our civilization to-day women faint and little children
    moan. But what that law may prove to be is not our affair. <B>If the conclusions
    that we reach run counter to our prejudices, let us not flinch; if they challenge
    institutions that have long been deemed wise and natural, let us not turn back. </B>... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/HG/PP/01_introductory_the_problem.htm">read

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is
    wrecking modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry
    George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole
    take the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able
    to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could
    have land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social
    ends. ...</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
      Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[book excerpt]: Up to recently we have proceeded from a premise that poverty
      is a consequence of multiple evils:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> lack of education restricting job opportunities;</li>
    <li> poor housing which stultified home life and suppressed initiative;</li>
    <li> fragile family relationships which distorted personality development.</li>
  </ul>
        <p>The logic of this approach suggested that each of these causes be attacked
        one by one. ...</p>
        <p>In addition to the absence of coordination and sufficiency, the programs of
          the past all have another common failing -- they are indirect. Each seeks to
        solve poverty by first solving something else. ... </p>
        <p>The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full
        employment or we must create incomes. ...</p>
        <p>We are likely to find that the problems of housing and education, instead
          of preceding the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty
          is first abolished. The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal
          on their own to alter housing decay. Negroes, who have a double disability,
          will have a greater effect on discrimination when they have the additional
        weapon of cash to use in their struggle. ... </p>
        <p>Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income
        operates as a consistently progressive measure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not
            the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor
            would simply perpetuate
            welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions.</li>
          <li>  Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically
                increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted
                to remain static under
                growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline.
                If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has
                risen, then the guaranteed
                income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage.
                Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur,
                nullifying the gains of security
              and stability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This proposal is not a &quot;civil rights&quot; program, in the sense that
            that term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including
            the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white
          will act in coalition to effect this change, because their combined strength
          will
        be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</p>
        <p>Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we
            realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already
            been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused
            social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest.
            The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their
            polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule,
        through welfare benefits.</p>
        <p>John Kenneth Galbraith has estimated that $20 billion a year would effect
            a guaranteed income, which he describes as &quot;not much more than we will
            spend the next fiscal year to rescue freedom and democracy and religious liberty
        as these are defined by 'experts' in Vietnam.&quot; ... </p>
        <p>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel
            and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when
            men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil
            or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us
            to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.
        ... </p>
        <p>[speech excerpt]</p>
        <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
            will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
            will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
            when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands,
            wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
        on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
        <p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
            annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And I
            say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
            a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
            to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
        on their own two feet right here on earth. ...</p>
        <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
            do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
            must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
            society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
            the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
            when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
            economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
            question,
            you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
            more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
            We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
            But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars
            needs restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my
            friends,
        when you deal with this,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;</li>
          <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;</li>
          <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
              water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are questions that must be asked.</p>
        <p>Now, don't think that you have me in a &quot;bind&quot; today. I'm not talking
        about Communism.</p>
        <p>What I'm saying to you this morning is that Communism forgets that life is
            individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood
            is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism
            but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines
            the truths of both. Now, when I say question the whole society, it means ultimately
            coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation,
            and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that
            are interrelated. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read

OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Apart from Free Trade, the great
economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="About_HG.html">Henry George</a></span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes
now not as a document of historic interest but as a challenge to
politicians, indeed to the entire electorate, to consider again the
causes of poverty and the basic issues of social and economic justice.
Perhaps current disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that
if justice in the community can only be achieved at the expense of
individual liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing
taxation and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of
the individual are complementary and that taxes may be raised without
undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major contribution
to current political and economic thought. Indeed it deserves a place
in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and yearning for a society
in which the genius of every person would be nurtured and the liberty
of every person respected. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>...

Land Values</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When considering world-wide
economics, most people think that land
rent contributes only a small insignificant portion of value. But<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> as
societies progress, land has become the predominant force in
determining the progress or poverty of all people within a community.
</span>Land in major or cities is so costly that people are forced to
move
further away and travel great distances in order to get to work and
social attractions. In the more developed countries of the world,
land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual production.&nbsp;

Robert G. Ingersoll: <a
 href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay
Sermon</a> (1886)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recollect what I said in the
first place -- that every man is as he
must be. Every crime is a necessary product. The seeds were all sown,
the land thoroughly plowed, the crop well attended to, and carefully
harvested. Every crime is born of necessity. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want less crime,
you must change the conditions. Poverty makes crime. Want, rags,
crusts, failure, misfortune -- all these awake the wild beast in man,
and finally he takes, and takes contrary to law, and becomes a
criminal.</span> And what do you do with him? You punish him. Why not
punish a
man for having the consumption? The time will come when you will see
that that is just as logical. What do you do with the criminal? You
send him to the penitentiary. Is he made better? Worse. The first thing
you do is to try to trample out his manhood, by putting an indignity
upon him. You mark him. You put him in stripes. At night you put him in
darkness. His feeling for revenge grows. you make a wild beast of him,
and he comes out of that place branded in body and soul, and then you
won't let him reform if he wants to. You put on airs above him, because
he has been in the penitentiary. The next time you look with scorn upon
a convict, let me beg of you to do one thing. Maybe you are not as bad
as I am, but do one thing. think of all the crimes you have wanted to
commit; think of all the crimes you would have committed if you had had
the opportunity; think of all the temptations to which you would have
yielded had nobody been looking; and then put your hand on your heart
and say whether you can justly look with contempt even upon a convict.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>None but the noblest should
infect punishment, even on the bassist.
</small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Society has no right to punish
any man in revenge -- no right to
punish
any man except for two objects -- one, the prevention of crime; the
other, the reformation of the criminal. How can you reform him?
Kindness is the sunshine in which virtue grows. Let it be understood by
these men that there is no revenge; let it be understood, too, that
they can reform.&nbsp; ... And yet we call our society civilized. There
is a mistake.&nbsp; ...<a

Kris Feder: <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html">Progress and Poverty
Today </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As this book was written, the
Industrial Revolution was
transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a
century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort
had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
evaporating.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor
Henry George marveled at the
stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why had not this unprecedented
increase in productivity banished want
and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
classes from poverty to prosperity?</span> Instead, George saw that the
division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
had increased the dependence of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces
beyond their control. The working poor were always, of course, the
most vulnerable in depressions, and last to recover from them.
Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America, and indeed, were
more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It
was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath
society, but through society. Those who are above the point of
separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down."
This, the "great enigma of our times," was the problem George set out
to solve in </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
earnings of the factors of
production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
persistently low level of real wages. <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Why,"
he asked, "in spite of
increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
give but a bare living?" ...</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To
George, the Malthusian analysis was abhorrent: It asserted that
no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
rates.&nbsp; <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public debate about economic
policy revolves today, as it always
has, around a tension between two fundamental social goals.
Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
efficiency and equity." <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most economists deem it their
business to evaluate the efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
distribution is itself wasteful of
wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
than competing for market success.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of
privileges and entitlements tends to
cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
may threaten whole civilizations.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><small>George's central contribution
was to show that the distinction
between individual property and common property forms a rational
basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
the private.</small> ...&nbsp;</b><a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html"><small

Ethical Land Tenure</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I want to tell you the story of
Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists
because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. For better soil, richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The other thing was some lands were closer to the market. Some
land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market. How do you have an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In this, then, we see affirmed the doctrine that natural
advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain. Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge.</small>

Rights Democracy: Public Finance based on Early Christian Teachings</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
wealth gap is increasing in the
US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the
population has $2 trillion more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the
suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
$582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the
land are Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A United Nations study of 83
countries showed that less than 5% of
rural landowners control three-quarters of the land. Other studies on
land ownership report these facts: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span>, 2% of
landowners hold 60% of the arable land while close to 70% of rural
households have little or none. Just 342 farm properties in Brazil
cover 183,397 square miles - an area larger than California. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Venezuela</span>, 77%
of the farmland is owned by 3% of the people. In Spain, 70 per cent of
the land is owned by 0.2 per cent of the people. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Britain</span>, 69
per cent
of the land is owned by 0.6 per cent of the population. Just 158,000
families own 41 million acres of land while 24 million families live on
four million acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[9]</span></small></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic human need for food
and shelter requires access of labor to
land. With access to land people can produce the basic requirements of
life. Access to land provides an enabling environment for life itself

human relations based on the fundamental equal right to exist. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
Land Problem in its two forms - the inequitable ownership and control

yet the human right to the earth is missing from the Bill of Rights,

<br>
<small>Democratic governance has not yet concerned itself with a "first
principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span>
The question of "Who Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question.
In venues when this question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The right to the earth has yet to be pronounced in human rights
covenants. Democracy is unclear, ethically weak, and on shaky ground
when it comes to the question of the right to the land and resources of
the earth. Democracy as presently constituted lacks this most
fundamental and basic human right - the equal right to earth. The right
to the earth is the great undiscovered revolution in both American and
global politics.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

will bless and support you
for keeping them warm. <span style="font-weight: bold;">As society
gets better organized,
though, you can gain by
guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
buy fuel and other
needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
free fuel that you might be
exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the
cash income from the
rents created when fuel prices rise, and have a lot more
to spare from the resulting
net gains, which I next explain.

A key to national unity is the fair treatment of intergovernmental
relations and subventions, as between rich and poor regions, and cities
and subregions within regions. By "rich" I mean rich not in total, but
per capita. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It makes sense to adjust
tax rates so they are higher in the regions with higher resource values
per capita, and then distribute a national dividend on a simple per
capita basis</span>, in the manner that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Alaska </span>has made famous on the state
level. The dividend should be "portable," so it does not bind the
recipient, like a serf, to a particular place, nor induce people to
move to the wrong places. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
It is not wise to distribute central revenues to local units of
government as such, for at least two reasons.</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>One is that some local units, in bleak, poor and remote
regions, or mined-out regions, might better be allowed to expire
peacefully as their residents leave with their portable dividends. Many
nations have wasted great wealth subsidizing people to remain in
obsolete locations and industries that they would better abandon, both
for their own and the nation's welfare.</small></li>
  <li><small>The other reason is that some poor regions, like the
American State of New Mexico, or Canada's Prince Edward Island, are
ruled by small oligarchies of wealthy people who create their own
region's poverty by the extreme inequality of resource ownership. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is folly to "tax poor people in rich
regions to subsidize a few rich people in poor regions," as often
occurs.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">Read the whole

<p>Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed?<strong> ...
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair? <strong>...</strong>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If people cannot be
expected to pay for educating the children that they ought to be able
to have, doesn't that mean that there is some fundamental unfairness

injustice and current unequal access to natural opportunities that
makes us reluctant to require people to pay the full costs of having
children?</span> In my conception of justice, we have not adequately
compensated for past injustice until we have put people in a position
where we are content to oblige them to pay the full costs of their
choices. ... </small><small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html"><span

Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!</small><br>
<br>
<small>There has been confusion about what is a right
and what is a privilege. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Real privileges are favors
arbitrarily given to some groups and not others.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small><br>

Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Wetzel_Justice.html">
</a>We all have our own personal interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Similarly, let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in the
natural wealth of the nation. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>
It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

Wages, generally, on all land, are driven down toward the point of bare
subsistence. Returns to capital are also depressed for the same reason,
deterring investment. When this is carried to an extreme -- when people

profit in applying capital -- the economy collapses. The inflated land

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things. It

for others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical
resolutions and synergies<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Summary</b>
</small><br>
<small>Dismal trade-offs, deadlocks, and standoffs are just mental
blocks
and smokescreens. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George began
with a quest for justice in
sharing the rent surplus. He found that justice and efficiency are
not at odds, we can have both.</span> This trade-off that many
economists
expound is a stall, a put-off to enervate and unman us so we won't do
anything. It may ease the conscience to think justice must be
sacrificed for efficiency, and schools starved and libraries closed
to free up incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done. We all
feel compassion by nature but, to survive and stay whole in this
world of beggars and bandits, learn to harden our hearts and cork it
in. We learn to screen out evidence of suffering and injustice, and
rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline, and
growing division between haves and have-nots. </small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>What we have
shown here is not just that
we can have both justice
and efficiency, but more, we cannot have either one without the
other. If we don't share rents efficiently, in the Georgist manner,
social and political pressures will continue to cause inefficient
sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic discourse is afflicted
with pessimists who firmly cling
to mutually inconsistent positions at the same time, each posing an
insoluble problem. Some, for example, believe the world is racing to
starvation, and favor limiting demand through birth control, while in
another context they deplore "overproduction," or "underconsumption,"
and favor choking off farm production to keep farmers from losing
money. George, of course, would see demand as the answer to supply,
and land as the field on which the twain may meet and satisfy each
other, leveling them upwards.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, some favor cheap power and
good roads for rural areas,
regardless of cost, and then favor low-density zoning to keep people
out. George, of course, would favor infilling to make full use of
short interior lines at high capacity, and lower cost per
customer.<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

Modern-day Feudalism: Land as God&#8217;s Gift</a></small></small><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">The ethical
foundations of land value taxation. </i>The
biblical Jubilee prescription -- redividing the land every half century
-- may have been feasible for a people practicing crude agriculture.
However, a modern civilization cannot reshuffle the land without
confiscating unmovable property or discouraging economic progress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
land value plan suggested here -- increasing land taxes, while
decreasing taxes on labor, production and buildings -- achieves the
same Jubilee goal without negative effects. It lets everyone share the
economic value of the land rather than the land itself, just as a
corporation, instead of carving up physical portions of itself each
year, lets shareholders enjoy portions of the profit.</span></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The
proposed change in the property tax would enable
the community to recapture community-created land values. Those who
hold land retain undisturbed possession of it so long as they pay back
their fair share of land tax to the community each year. Those with
prized sites pay most; holders of poor locations pay least.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Society
suffers a loss when speculators hold highly
productive sites out of use. A land value tax usually persuades owners
to use land or to sell it to others who wish to do so. If not, the
higher tax compensates society for the land privileges it grants. This
approach permits the elimination or major reduction of other taxes that
weigh too heavily on wages, while it contributes to increases in local
productivity.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Seven
Pennsylvania cities have independently
increased tax rates on land while imposing much lower tax rates on
buildings. Scranton, with a population of 87,000, has had a modest
two-rate tax for 70 years. When federal funding was cut in 1980, it
raised the tax rate on land to four times that on buildings. In the
next two years, the value of private construction in Scranton rose 22
per cent. In contrast, Wilkes-Barre, 18 miles away, kept its old tax
system, and construction dropped 44 per cent during the same period. </small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Strapped
for funds in 1974, Harrisburg twice dropped
tax rates on buildings and twice increased rates on land. Almost every
homeowner got a tax break. McKeesport adopted the two-rate tax in 1980,
raising revenues 50 per cent and getting the town out of debt. More
remarkably, building investment rose 36 per cent, while falling 14 per
cent in neighboring Duquesne and more than twice that in nearby
Clairton. Since then, Duquesne, along with New Castle and Washington,
has adopted a two-rate tax. </small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The largest
American city using the two-rate tax is
Pittsburgh. After the city raised its land-tax rate to four times its
building-tax rate in 1979, new construction rose a healthy 14 per cent.
In 1980, the land-tax rate rose to five times the building rate, and
the value of construction shot up 212 per cent. When in 1982 the city
widened the gap to six times the building rate, the value of new
building permits rose 600 per cent.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>In all
these cities, despite a national recession
and a severe steel crisis in their region, changes in the property tax
structure produced results that were nothing short of startling. As
detailed in a <i>Fortune </i>article ("Higher Taxes That Promote
Development," August 8, 1983), housing and downtown buildings
increased in numbers and dollar value. Homeowners enjoyed tax
reductions, and housing costs were kept low. New construction jobs
eased losses in the industrial sector.</small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Poverty,
joblessness and homelessness have been
central concerns of religious social-action groups. There is a growing
awareness that neither private nor public charity is sufficient in
dealing with these problems. Shifting property taxes offers an
effective way to encourage public policy to be responsive to blighted
cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter
on the economy and parallel works by the Presbyterians, United
Methodists and the United Church of Christ. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The need to address
poverty&#8217;s basic causes, including the unhealthy concentration of
America&#8217;s land and resources in the hands of so few owners -- who have
tended to misappropriate land values -- ought to be high on our
religious and public policy agendas.</span></small></font>&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If
the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the case of Washington,
B.C., most
landowners are petty holders. </span>The biggest portion of their
property value is in their homes or small shops, only 15 or 20% in
land. Only five percent of the city's properties, land and buildings
together, are valued over $100,000. Because the high peaks of land
values are concentrated mainly in the central business district, those
who walk away with the lion's share of the community's land values are
a mere handful of owners.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decade after decade, billions
of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. </span>It
is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Henry Reuss, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking,
Finances and
Urban Affairs, recently pointed out, that over the past thirty years,
the Consumer Price Index rose 300%, the price of the average new home
went up 500%, and the price of the land under that average new house
went up 1,275%. "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ways must be
found" he said, "to curb the tendency to invest more and more in land,
a passive activity that adds not a single acre to the nation's wealth.
Instead we must encourage investments in job-creating plant and
equipment."</span>...&nbsp;</small>

<p><a href="../docs/unindexed/FordH_1942.htm">Henry Ford Talks About War and
    Your Future</a> - 1942 interview </p>
<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
      and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
      the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If
      the trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures
      on public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
    <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting
      corporations are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts
      getting the rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers
      will pay commons rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves
      as beneficiaries of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will
      be the same, but his payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden
      products. The more he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters
      will get back less than they put in, while low polluters will get back
      more. The microeconomic incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See
      figure 6.1.)</p>
    <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
      incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s
      interest to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent for
      scarce things works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine
      you&#8217;re a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake
      of argument) your responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations,
      you want to increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits
      you sell, or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you
      lower the number of permits.</p>
    <p>This macroeconomic phenomenon &#8212; that less pollution yields more
      income for citizens &#8212; is the ultimate knockout punch for commons
      trusts. It aligns the interests of future generations with, rather than
      against, those of living citizens. By so doing, it lets us chart a transition
      to sustainability in which the political pressure is for faster pollution
      reduction rather than slower.</p>
    <p>There&#8217;s one further argument for recycling commons rent through
      trusts. As rent is recycled from overusers of the commons to underusers,
      income is shifted from rich to poor. That&#8217;s because rich households,
      on average, use the commons more than poor households. They drive SUVs,
      fly in jets, and have large homes to heat and cool &#8212; thus they dump
      more waste into the biosphere. Studies by Congress and independent economists
      have shown that only a rent recycling system like the one just described
      can protect the poor. Absent such a system, the poor will pay commons rent
      and get nothing back. In other words, they&#8217;ll get poorer.</p>
    <p>As always, there are a few caveats.</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li> First, to the extent commons rent is used for public goods rather
          than per capita dividends, the income recycling effects are diminished.
          This is offset, however, by the fact that public goods benefit everyone.</li>
        <li> Second, the less-pollution-equals-more-dividends formula doesn&#8217;t
          work indefinitely. At some point after less polluting technologies
          have been widely deployed, the demand for pollution absorption will
          become elastic. Then, lowering the number of pollution permits sold
          will decrease income to citizens. But that time is far in the future,
          and when it comes, the world will be a healthier place. And even then,
          trustees won&#8217;t be able to increase the number of pollution permits
          without violating their responsibility to future generations. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    <p><br>
      The Effect on Poverty</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m now ready to make a bold assertion: sharing commons rent through
      per capita dividends isn&#8217;t just the best way to bring our economy
      into harmony with nature, it&#8217;s also the best way to reduce poverty.
      That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s no other pool of money of comparable
      size to which poor people have a legitimate claim.</p>
    <p>The free market notion that those at the bottom of the ladder will somehow
      lift themselves out of poverty, without any capital or property, just isn&#8217;t
      credible any longer. Our economic operating system has long been stacked
      against the poor, and globalization hasn&#8217;t made it any less so. The
      prospects for taxing and spending the poor out of poverty aren&#8217;t
      much brighter. Arguably, such policies reached their zenith in the Johnson
      era of the 1960s, and didn&#8217;t get the job done.</p>
    <p>The reason commons rent-sharing can work is that it&#8217;s driven not
      only &#8212; or even primarily &#8212; by compassion for the poor. Rather,
      it&#8217;s driven primarily by the need to preserve threatened ecosystems.
      When this problem is tackled, the question of who gets commons rent will
      necessarily arise; we can&#8217;t solve the first problem without addressing
      the latter. We&#8217;ll then have to decide whether to take, once again,
      the commons from the poor, or let them share in our joint inheritance.</p>
    <p>The poor&#8217;s claim on commons rent is, of course, no different from
      the claim of middle-income households or the rich: commons rent rightfully
      belongs to everyone. But commons rent, if fully paid, would boost living
      standards for the poor much more than for anyone else. And unlike other
      forms of help for the poor, commons rent can&#8217;t be derided as welfare.
      It is, technically, unearned income, but no more so than dividends received
      by inheritors of private wealth. It&#8217;s property income, and should
      be a universal property right. That, I believe, is a winnable political
      strategy, as well as sound economic policy. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our problem today, as yesterday,
and the days before, back to the
earliest recorded times, is POVERTY.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>...</strong> Let us begin this study of
the likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. ... <a
