<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Energy-wasting
biases.</b> Identifying and eliminating tax biases to both extracting
and consuming energy, and other primary products. Whether on balance
these biases raise or lower prices to consumers is not known, but
neither is it relevant here: the point is that the combination raises
the total volume of extracting the primary products, and of course of
consequent combustion and pollution.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The writer has identified many of these biases elsewhere
(Gaffney,
1978). Suffice it here to observe the following. It is not just that
a commodity like gasoline is subsidized; it is worse than that.
Within the stream of production, subsidies go to those activities
involved in extraction, while taxes fall on activities downstream
that conserve and economize on the primary product (Gaffney, 1982). <a

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
  Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If land and land rent are the
strongest determinants to Georgists,
energy is its closest counterpart to ecological economists. Just as
land rent can be measured fully in terms the relative surplus it
produces in any given socio-economic context, energy can be traced and
calculated in calories, BTU&#8217;s or joules. Land rent is completely a
human product &#8212; there is no rent where there are no people, as land has
no market value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">On the other hand,
energy exists regardless whether
people are present or not, as it is a component of nature itself. But
not all energy is now recognized as relevant in economics; only that
energy which is employed in the human economy, and we assume that the
human economy is necessarily bounded. Wind, sunlight and lightening are
as yet unpriced and are peripheral today even in ecological economics.
</span>Attention is given more to those natural resources potentially
procurable or otherwise relevant to human dependency, and energy
certainly is primary. So rather than regard energy as a free good and
largely outside the economy&nbsp;as neoclassical
economics assumes, energy will likely continue to be central &#8212; even the
driving force &#8212; in ecological economics. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Indeed just about all other factors of production are
essentially
convertible from energy. Besides that used in households, industry, and
transportation sectors, agriculture &#8212; at least linked to developed
economies &#8212; is essentially energy driven. As Martinez-Alier has shown,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">86</span></small>
modern agriculture is essentially unfeasible without reliance upon
applied energy forms, and the diets of modern societies are heavily
reliant upon energy in the forms of intensive fertilizer use, intensive
application of machinery, and animal protein-fed farmers. By way of
contrast, in pre-modern agricultural societies one could argue that
human and animal energy account for all the foodstuffs produced, and
were used in turn to assure the continuance of the agricultural cycle.
Unlike modern societies they are in energy equilibrium. Hall<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">87</span></small>
argues that energy is the determining factor in the development success
of all economies, posing momentous challenges for the future as
projected shortages of fossil fuel sources loom on the horizon. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The regard for steady-state socio-economic dependence upon the
natural
environment raises profound questions about the extent to which human
activity is possible without continuing depletion of the earth&#8217;s energy
resources, mainly fossil fuels. On the one hand are those that believe
that contemporary society&#8217;s reliance upon intensive energy has become
so embedded that continued sustainable life is impossible.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>Among
these are noted ecologist writers such as Paul and Ann Ehrlich who
envision the continued boom and ultimate collapse of all civilized
nations.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
The other view includes the majority of ecological economists who hold
out hope that it might be possible to shift in time to renewable energy
sources before damage to the ecosystem is irreversible. This view is
exemplified by those who could be called the &#8220;steady-staters,&#8221; and who
believe that there is still time to bring economic practices into
an equilibrium state and avoid the doomsday scenario. Among the latter
are Herman Daly, one of whose books is entitled Steady State Economics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small> An
interesting discourse is unfolding among this community, perhaps as
reflective of personal temperament as much as it is due to research
interest and disciplinary background. At the moment it is a focus of
intensive and increasing research and interest. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the past, land owners owed services to
      king, but in this age of equality then we owe our neighbors. We have an equal
      right to the earth. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The community creates rent.</span> Land
        value rises when infrastructure goes on land. Technology progresses when
        the community becomes more tranquil and density goes up. Density is a really
        good measure of land value. No one owner by himself is responsible for
        density. Rent from land value is justified because all should share in
        the rent. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the community collected the rent, it would
    motivate owners not to speculate in anticipation of a higher future return.
    There would be a tendency to infill in the city and make cities more efficient.</span> It
    would make mass transit more efficient. We could collect some rent in a greater
    amount as ecological security deposits for gas stations with gas pump brownfields.
    We could actually put a surcharge on gasoline and put the playing field back
    to level between cars and other transportation. If we collected ground rent
    around transit stops and dedicated that income stream to the transit system,
    we could run a free system. When built, BART (Bay Area CA Rapid Transit) did
    a study and found it could run BART free. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">If we had free mass transit,
    people would choose to ride instead of drive.</span> It becomes more efficient
    and more people use, increasing the mobility of citizens in the region. If
    we get people out of cars, that reduces air pollution, noises, run off, and
    use of resources. ...&nbsp;<a href="docs/Smith_SRTS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

    Human Society</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Energy -
    Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. By taxing, rather than living off Rent, governments
        can afford to lose land to a dam or its value to a nuclear power plant. Clean
        energy, on the other hand, would tred lightly on land values, the proper
        source of public funds. </li>
    <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on property makes improvements to buildings
          more expensive year after year. Some states do exempt certain ap-tech
      improvements, which amounts to a few dollars, but they also grant tax-free
      bonds to utilities,
          which adds up to millions of dollars. States make up its exemptions
      by raising tax rates. An ecologizer may pay no greater property tax for
      solar panels,
          but like everyone else will pay more to higher taxes on sales and income. </li>
    <li><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of AC electricity does not include all
          the costs from inundated valleys, nuclear radiation, acid rain, etc.,
      disadvantaging safe power producers. </li>
    <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>. The federal government pays a billion dollars
      a year to oil companies to pump oil back into the ground as a "strategic reserve" rather
        than just leave it under Louisiana and Texas. Cost-plus contracts benefit
        power utilities, not independent solar converters. Rents, tax breaks,
      license, and subsidies total trillions each year in the US. Destructive
      subsidies
        total $1.5 trillion each year worldwide (The Natural Wealth of Nations:
      Harnessing the Market for the Environment, 1998, by David Roodman in The
      Worldwatch
        Environmental Alert Series; he also suggests capturing the windfall rent-jumps
        in settled areas.) Thus virgin extraction, sprawl, mechani-chemical agri-business,
        gasoline car manufacture, and fossil fuels look like bargains, making
      recycling, eco-homes, organic gardening, mass transit, and solar power
      look expensive.
        Low prices win over customers who string along investors. As long as
      the economy is rigged against the eco-system, guess which one is going
      to continue
        to go downhill? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Henry David Thoreau said the best thing government can do for business is
    get out of it. Nevertheless, some hope to shift subsidies from grey bads to
    green goods. Yet the state need not subsidize at all. It's dauntingly difficult
    to know whom to fund; a solar steam generator may be the most promising idea
    one day while photovoltaics are the next. Efficient alternatives don't need
    largesse but fairness. A handout shields new industry from the forces that
    compel efficient growth. The best thing government can do for the environment
    is exit environmental enterprise. ... <a href="docs/Smith_SS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
