  <blockquote>
    <p>For most homeowners, their mortgage payment is their largest single expense.&nbsp; Housing
        prices in most coastal states are rising far faster than wages.&nbsp; Low
        interest rates allowed buyers to borrow more than they'd been able to borrow
        at higher
        rates &#8212; and the beneficiaries were not the buyers, but rather the <em>sellers</em> (who
        had a monopoly good to offer &#8212; a home in a certain
        location &#8212; and could
        leave town
        with a windfall which would support them in comfort in a less desirable
        part of the country), <em>the
        real
        estate
        brokers</em> (who collected 6% of a higher transaction amount) and <em>the
        mortgage lenders</em>.</p>
    <p>Further, with the value of coastal-state properties rising, those who
      owned those properties could borrow at low interest rates against the land
      equity,
        allowing them to spend money their work hadn't earned.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
        those in middle America and those <em>without</em> valuable land equity are relegated
        to payday loans and credit card borrowing, which takes a terrible toll on
        their lives,
        if they find that their expenses exceed their wages.</p>
    <p>When one buys a home, one agrees to a price with the seller, then seeks
        a mortgage lender to pay them the portion of the purchase price one doesn't
        have in hand. At one time, a 20% down payment was typical, and some people
        tend to think in terms of buying the land &quot;outright&quot; and using
        a mortgage for the house itself. But today, with the exception of new
        houses on the
        fringe, a residential property is likely to be at least 50% land value
        if it is in one of the major metropolitan areas, and in some, more like
        75% land value. [See the 2006 Federal Reserve Board study on the Price
        of Residential Land.] So one is borrowing a significant portion of the
        value
        of the land.</p>
    <p>Should the mortgage lenders get the interest on the land value, or
          should we use the capitalized value of the land to finance our
        common spending? That is the question. We can guess what the
        mortgage
            lenders think. What do <em>you</em> think? Which is better for our children?
            Which is better for a society dedicated to the proposition that all men
            are created equal, that none should be subject to others, that none should
            be privileged to privatize what we all together create?</p>

          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... very little of real
            estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
            tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
            industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
            combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
            This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
            finance onto other taxpayers. ...<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major conclusion is
            that, at least until
            re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
            tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
            employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
          </span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
            the
            ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
            payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
            tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
            income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
            depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
            the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
            estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
            year after year.<strong> ... </strong><br>
          <br>
          </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Mortgage
              Debt Converts Rent into Interest<br>
          <br>
          </span>Depreciation rules are not the only reason why the real estate
              sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
              income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum
              of income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion
              of
              cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. Since the
              early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
              larger than the figures reported for net rental income. As Charts 3a,
              3b, 3c, and 3d illustrate, real estate investors and homeowners have
              become the financial sector&#8217;s prime customers. According to the
              Federal Reserve Board, 1994 mortgage debt of $4.3 trillion represented
              some 46
              percent of the economy's $9.3 trillion private nonfinancial debt, and
              a third of the total $12.8 trillion U.S. debt.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> NIPA
              statistics indicate that about 70 percent of loans to business
              borrowers currently are made to the real estate sector, making it the
              major absorber of savings and payer of interest.<br>
          <br>
          Most cash flow now ends up neither with developers nor with the tax
              authorities, but as interest paid to banks, insurance companies and
              other mortgage lenders. In fact, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mortgage
              interest now absorbs seven
              percent of national income, up from just one percent in the late 1940s</span>.
              In 1993 (the most recent year for which NIPA statistics are available)
              the real estate sector generated some $326 billion in interest
              payments, more than it contributed in income taxes and state and local
              property taxes together. Meanwhile, over the past half century, net
              declarable income plus capital consumption allowances and property
              taxes have been cut in half as a proportion of national income, from
              over ten percent to less than five percent. Thus interest is the real
              estate industry&#8217;s major cost, and as such, has helped to minimize the
              real estate industry&#8217;s income tax liability.<br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>One
              effect of favorable depreciation and capital gains tax treatment is
              to spur debt pyramiding for the real estate industry. The tax structure
              provides a distortionary incentive for real estate holders to borrow
              excessively, converting rental income into a nontaxable mortgage
              interest cost while waiting for capital gains to accrue. This,
              alongside financial deregulation of the nation&#8217;s S&amp;Ls, was
              a major factor in the over-building spree of the 80's.<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes, of course, no capital gains accrue. In some highly
              conspicuous cases, landlords have walked away from their properties,
              leaving their mortgage lenders holding the bag. This is what led to the
              $500 billion FSLIC bailout by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
              Many smaller real estate parcels likewise were abandoned in central
              city areas from New York to Los Angeles. Indeed, this process was part
              of an international phenomenon, extending from Canary Wharf in London
              to Tokyo&#8217;s Bubble Economy of 1985-1980. Nevertheless, holding onto
              properties by paying off their mortgage loans is made easier by
              favorable tax treatment. Indeed, nominal tax losses during 1984-91
              enabled building investors not only to earn a rising cash flow, but to
              gain tax credits to shelter their otherwise taxable income earned in
              other sectors.<br>
          <br>
          Real estate is pledged to mortgage lenders as collateral in case the
              promised interest payments fail to materialize. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Capital gains have been
              collateralized into new and larger loans decade after decade,
              increasing the mortgage burden that transforms rental income and
              depreciation allowances into interest payments. Ultimately, the
              financial rentiers end up with most of the cash flow which landlords --
              and government tax collectors -- relinquish.</span><br>
          <br>
          Tax-deductibility of mortgage costs does not impair government revenues
              if mortgage lenders pay taxes on their interest income. Moreover,
              lenders may be able to shift part of the tax burden to borrowers by
              charging higher interest rates.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
          Actually, however, much interest income manages to avoid taxation, such
              as that of banks adding to their loss coverage funds (or otherwise
              offsetting their income) or individuals with tax shelters. The
              insurance and financial industries have long obtained virtual tax
              exemption for their income. ...</small><a

                well-located land, and natural resources as their own exclusive private
                property.</span> These enormous land values and resource rents are also
                accruing as unearned income to banks holding mortgages based on
                exploitative compound interest rates. It may be of interest to note
                that the word "mortgage" means "dead hand." Truly, when one must work
                so many years of one's life to pay off a mortgage, one productive hand
                is as if dead in terms of producing for oneself, as the labor of that
                hand pays the mortgage. For the 33% of citizens (40 million people) in
                the United States who are renters, there is not even equity ownership
                to look forward to after a life of labor. For the more than three
                million homeless people in American and the multi-millions who are

      <p><em>Q14. How would you adjust mortgages to the single tax scheme?</em><br>
        A. Mortgages are modified deeds, and mortgageors are landowners in degree.
          I would make no adjustment, but would warn mortgageors and mortgagees
          to adjust their interests as they see fit when they make their mortgages,
          just as I would warn buyers and sellers of land to guard their interests
          as between themselves by their contracts. Full notice has now been
          given that as soon as possible and as fast as possible we propose to
          induce the people to bring about a condition in which land values will
          be taken for public use and improvement values be left for private
          use. People who in the face of this notice neglect to protect themselves
          in their contracts have no one else to blame if when the change comes
          they suffer pecuniary loss in the re-adjustment.<br>
