<blockquote>
  <p>In most cities, parking lots are a temporary land use, while the owner of
    the land is waiting for land values to rise. Having parking available is
    desirable, but when parking lots predominate instead of parking garages,
    we use a lot
    of expensive infrastructure &#8212; streets, highways, transportation systems,
    police, fire, ambulance, schools, libraries, even buses and subways &#8212; to
    support very light use of valuable sites. </p>
  <p>Under the regular property tax, the
      owner
      of a
      parking
      lot
      pays very
      little
      property
      tax, so he has little incentive to look for ways to use the land more intensively,
      in ways that would benefit the community and the economy. But when we divorce
      the tax on land values from the tax on building values, we can increase
    the millage rate on the land, and decrease or eliminate the millage rate
    on the
    buildings. So one of those parking lots might become a parking garage, with
     taxes imposed on the garage itself, and the other parking lots be developed
    into office buildings, or condominiums, or retail, all in the center of the
    business
    district &#8212; providing jobs, housing and shopping where they are accessible
    to the largest possible number of people, from a 360&deg; radius. This is
    an efficient market for all of us.</p>
  <p>Metered street parking is also important for many kinds of retail businesses
    that depend on auto traffic. A 10' by 20' parking spot in a busy healthy
    downtown can produce a huge amount of revenue itself. A free parking spot
    encourages
    users to park there all day. A metered spot encourages them to accomplish
    their errands and free up the spot for someon else to use. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This substantial leakage of
economic base results in multiple declines in state income.&nbsp;
Cities love to commission "economic base" studies, and a small industry
of moonlighting economists love to perform them, usually to rationalize
subsidizing some transnational conglomerate to put in a branch plant.
They use canned "input-output" models to show how every dollar invested
generates $2-3 of induced investment locally. Yet no one has seized on
this obvious case to show that local property taxes, substituted for
absentee rent payments, creates multiple increases in local income. The
whole intellectual apparatus is dominated by absentee investors and
used for their benefit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Many rents may be taxed in other ways. Georgists have long noted
that parking meters are a way of collecting rent for use of public
land, but they are pikers when it comes to estimating the value
thereof. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Donald Shoup, a UCLA
professor, estimates the value of street parking, if properly priced,
as enough to replace the entire property tax.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parking, however, is less than
half the story. </span>Vehicles also use public space when they are
moving, often bumper-to-bumper in heavy traffic. Bridge, tunnel and
ferry tolls reflect this obvious fact, and yet even most Georgists
resist the obvious logical extension of the principle: taxes on
vehicles and fuels are a kind of rough "land tax on wheels." The
revenue potentials are breathtaking. Auto dealers, of course, spearhead
the opposition. Observe how many acres each dealership preempts, and
you will understand how they make so much money to brainwash the public
into rejecting such taxes, along, of course, with conventional property
taxes on their land.... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CG-E.html"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html"><br>
</a></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>III. Applications
to Congestion<br>
</b></small><small>The logic of efficient environmental protection
applies with few
changes to issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple
example of the application of land value taxation to solving a
problem of congestion. If there is a shortage of parking places (at a
zero price) then the introduction of parking meters (charging rent
for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the price of
a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and
demand at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking
only where the revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the
value of the additional lane in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few
years we will have parking meters with prices that vary by time of
day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime, we get by
with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the day
when demand is greatest.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charging rent for parking is only
a small step from charging rent
for cars that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on
the streets, the slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having
one more car on the streets is the value of the extra travel time
that everyone else endures because of the one additional car. In many
places, the congestion cost of traffic is less than the cost of
administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not the case
everywhere. <b><a href="Vickrey.html">William Vickrey</a></b> used to say that his estimate of
the cost in additional delays of having one more car in midtown
Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour. He
would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be
charged $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan.
He had estimated marginal cost at the present level of usage. The
efficient charge -- perhaps $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the
streets so greatly that the marginal congestion cost of street usage
would equal the price. Efficient congestion prices for using the
streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities) would not
merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special
charges for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal
way that created congestion. If we could keep track of the movements
of vehicles, then for any vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up
vehicles that wanted to move, there would be a charge for the
resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high. Companies
making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the
day. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Congestion charges also apply
to bottlenecks such as bridges
and tunnels.</b> Whenever such a facility has cars backed up seeking
to use it, efficiency is improved by applying a toll that reduces
demand to capacity. The same output is produced, revenue is
generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The efficiency of congestion
pricing would also apply to such
public facilities as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to
have more take-offs and landings than an airport can accommodate, it
is efficient and just to allocate take-off and landing slots by
price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest of airlines, has
prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead to
allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Central Park in New York, there
are fewer baseball fields than
are demanded at a zero price. There is a private company that has the
right and responsibility to organize the leagues that are allowed to
use the fields. This company is able to charge fees that implicitly
include the scarcity value of the fields. A recognition that the
parks are the common heritage of everyone in the city would lead
instead to a charge for using the ball fields that equated supply and
demand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are also applications of
congestion prices at an
international level. For example, <b>there may be congestion in
geosynchronous orbits for satellites</b>. If this should occur, then
the just thing to do is to charge market-clearing rents for
geo-synchronous orbits and share the proceeds among all nations in
proportion to their populations.&nbsp; <b>... </b><span

Shapes Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Some owners do keep prime sites
covered with parking
lots or abandoned buildings while
waiting for land
values to rise</span>. "Good numbers are hard
to come by,"
notes <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/auth/Batt.html">Bill Batt</a>, former fiscal policy
researcher for the
New York legislature, "but easily a
quarter of a US city
is under-utilized." Thus
urban cores decay, an
entropy that seems
natural and inevitable yet
is policy-induced.&nbsp;
...</small><br>
<br>
<small> The world looks different to owners
dozing at the wheel,
waiting for land values to rise.
Title-holders keeping
prime downtown sites vastly
underutilized "now pay
only, say, $25,000 per year in
property tax for a half
block," figures <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Dr. Mason Gaffney</a>
of
the University of
California at Riverside. "Post-PTS
(property tax shift),
these owners of parking lots and
abandoned
warehouses might have to part with
three times that
amount each year." At $75,000 per
annum, no longer
could they afford to let prime sites
lie relatively idle.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
"They'll put their land to uses that
generate much more
revenue than does an empty building or
car-covered
lot,"</span> adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy
building
apartments, stores, offices, schools,
theaters, mixing
all uses together to maximize their
return."

<small> This property tax shift (PTS) "helps
cities recover from
auto-dependency," notes Gihring,
author of The Journal
of the American Planning
Association&#8217;s first article on
revenue reform (1999 Winter). The PTS
turns lots for
cars into structures for people. By
densifying a city, it
provides more riders for mass transit,
justifying more
routes and times.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> As riding becomes
convenient while
remaining a bargain, and parking grows
inconvenient
while rising in cost, more people
switch from driving to
riding. </span>Less traffic lets cities
transform streets for bikes,
pedestrians, sidewalk cafes, and
street performers.&nbsp;

Robert V. Andelson&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Andelson_HGRC.html">Henry
George and the Reconstruction of Capitalism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This would, of course, eliminate
all speculative profit in landholding, squeeze the "speculative water"
out of land prices, and in effect bring back the frontier by making
cheap land readily available to everyone -- at least initially. The
result would be to raise the margin of production, increase real wages,
and stimulate building and productivity. Eventually, the flourishing
economy would cause use value to exceed the former speculative value,
but instead of being engrossed by those who make no contribution to the
economy, land rent would flow into the public coffers in place of taxes
levied upon labor and capital. The land-value charge is really what
Walt Rybeck so aptly calls "a super user's fee." For the privilege of
exclusive access to and disposition of a site and its natural
resources, the owner pays an indemnity to those who are thereby
dispossessed -- an indemnity reflecting precisely the market value of
his privilege, collected through the tax mechanism and relieving them
of the burden of payment for public services. What could be more fair?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, I daresay that each one of you, probably without
realizing it, frequently pays something that partakes of the principle
of such a "super user's fee" whether you own land or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Every time you put money in a parking
meter, you are purchasing a temporary monopoly of the parking space.
Don't ever complain about having to put money in a public parking
meter; it's a bargain for you. You're getting a free gift from the
community -- the difference between what you pay and what a commercial
parking lot in the vicinity would charge!&nbsp; </span><a
