  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">But before this time the reader,
      unless he has given previous attention to the subject, is full of objections
      to the above doctrine: &quot;How
          about the law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a
          piece of land as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold
          on to it till he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present
          he certainly has this statutory right, which has been so long and so
          universally recognized that most people suppose it to be not only a
          legal, but a real
          or equitable right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth
          of population in a city, for example, can buy a well-located block
          at a moderate figure
          from some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence
          it off against all comers and give it no further attention except to
          pay
          the very
          small tax usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
          stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police
          and fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently
          that the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times
          what it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the
          very community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its
          taxes created practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
          very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
          he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
          of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its
          rank injustice.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Being the high financiers of
      their days and generations, they managed to contrive taxes which could
      be plausibly and gradually imposed
          upon the landless, until within a few generations they had succeeded
      in shifting most of the cost of government on to the plebeians without
      giving up a foot
          of land or any considerable part of the income therefrom. The &quot;common
          people&quot; were deftly loaded with the heavy end of the beam, which
          they have been carrying ever since; while the arbitrarily created landlords
          and
          their successors, down to the present day, have kept their tight hold
          on the community's natural income.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their tenure
          of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary have so buttressed
          it with centuries of legislation, precedents, and judicial decisions, that
          any proposition to hark back to the terms of the original bargain, whereby
          the owners of the land agreed to pay the expenses of the government, is now
          denounced as anarchy and sacrilege.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">          Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a buyer
            acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic rent belongs
            to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it as soon as the
            voters thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and wrong of the matter,
            which are not hard to grasp when the subject is presented in its simplest
            form.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece
          of farm land. Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner
          lot centrally located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by,
          say, Mr. John William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm,
          and is an heirloom. It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father
          nor his grandfather. There is a little old building on it, which has always
          been rented at a figure ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that
          the owner has been handsomely subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds
          during a period of the city's growth in which the increase in population
          and the expenditure of public money in that neighborhood have raised the
          value of this corner location to, say, two hundred times its early value.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
          be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of
          population is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to
          the benefit of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives
          a twenty-one year lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with
          a privilege to the lessee of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees
          to pay all taxes.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Now what is this net $20,000
      a year, which will be regularly remitted to Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe
      or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
          for the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it
          down. Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got
          to be blasted out as part of its improvement.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
          the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
          $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
          years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
          and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">That the latter has no good right
      to it is at once evident when we remember that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody
          else has got to give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000
          that some men and women have got to work to earn every year to hand
          over to
          a man who
          does not render,
          and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth of public
          or private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice
          which we call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic
          in its
          social results. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

          <p><strong>Abstract<br>
            </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
            by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
            wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall
            income; it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or
            corporation; it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise.
            There is ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it
            has created, as well as to that which no individual or party has earned.
            Analysis increasingly makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is
            far larger than official government figures indicate; in fact it is likely
            sufficient to supplant all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and
            interest) which are acknowledged to have so many negative effects. Recovering
            economic rent in all its manifestations by taxing its various bases actually
            can foster economic performance and yield other benefits that make it the
            natural source of revenue for governments. Such a tax is essentially painless.        </p>
          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>Under current tax regimes, some people get hit with onerous bills while
            others get windfall gains.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></font> If
            taxes only on windfalls were collected, we could eliminate those burdens
            that fall unfairly upon people who have rightfully earned their income
            and wealth, and the total would likely remain revenue neutral. This is
            my thesis here, one which should compel the attention of those who would
            redesign our tax system.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">1. A windfall, usually defined, is &quot;an unexpected
                financial gain, or a stroke of luck.&quot; But, as one exhaustive
                study makes clear, it is typically the consequence of some public
              policy decision. ...</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>... Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings
            causes people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less,
            and taxing buildings causes people to build less. The result is that
            economists as well as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital.
            Another alternative is to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood
            that taxing labor normally discourages people from working as much as
            they would in the absence of a tax. From this comes sentiment against
            taxing labor, even though for want of any alternative, people have today
            commonly come to accept it as a necessity. But electing to tax labor,
            just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion of the virtues of
            taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but rather land as
            location. <strong>Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of all,
            as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
            being well
            situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
            demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that
            land's price. To be sure many people have learned to position themselves
            in situations where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed
            these people come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the
            fact is that that market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is
            the result of common enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle
            on land sites. An investment in land, in any form it might take, is speculation
            in greater or lesser degree. ...</strong></p>
          <p>To be sure, by replacing taxes on labor and capital with taxes on land
            rent, people will enjoy greater returns for their enterprise and will
            be able to keep what they have earned. But people will also cease, at
            least those few who have been so lucky, to be able to rely on windfall
            unearned gains that they have in many cases come to regard as their entitlements.
            The greatest forfeiture of such windfall gains will be homeowners who
            have come to see their title to a home as an investment, and not a place
            to live. But whereas some residential locations have seen enormous increases
            in market prices &#8212; as much as 20 percent yearly on occasion &#8212; others
            have enjoyed no such fortune. People may come to understand that houses
            depreciate just like cars, refrigerators and computers. They may also
            see that it is only land value that increases, and realize that any gain
            which their land has is due to the general vitality of their community
            and region. It may help them to realize that they are linked to and dependent
            upon the society as a whole, and that their fortune is not in this dimension
            of their own making.</p>
          <p>Well over a century ago, John Stuart Mill recognized that</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> landlords grow richer in their sleep without working, risking
              or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
              does
              from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
              and not to the individual who might hold title.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17] </em></strong></font><font size="-1">... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the

        <blockquote>Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is
          a misnomer because what is really involved is value created by the
          community being retained by the community rather than being appropriated
          by private landholders. For example, under current arrangements landowners
          receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains when the market value of their
          land rises as a result of publicly provided infrastructure being built
          nearby, or when local government zoning decisions reclassify their
          land as appropriate for further development. In this way, individual
          landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of community-generated
          processes. Such arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders
          to appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values,
          thereby rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive
          endeavour. The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast,
          would eliminate such perverse incentives and thereby more effectively
          align private and public interests in the use of society&#8217;s resources.
          ...
          <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal
            source of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource,
            its private ownership necessarily excludes large sections of the
            community from its benefits. A landowning class thereby gains political
            economic power. In George&#8217;s own time the social identity and
            power of this landowning class was distinctive. Those who could not
            afford to buy land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier few who
            could. By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
            created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners and
            redistributed throughout the community more equitably in order to
            address social goals.</p>
          <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
            relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because
            land is the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons
            outlines the concentration of farming land in particular in the hands
            of a few very wealthy corporations and individuals &#8211; what he
            refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons, 1999:
            23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years
            has also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State
            of New South Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361
            billion over the period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based
            taxes clawed back only $44 billion in government revenues, comprising
            only about 12% of the land-related economic surplus. So 88% was retained
            as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by landowners (Stilwell and Jordan,
            forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax with fewer exemptions could
            have substantially reduced this private wealth appropriation. This
            is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping 100% through
            land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems of people&#8217;s
            ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth resulting
            from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
            But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and
            public appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based
            wealth. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
  investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
  keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
  efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
  higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
  might represent, this constituted <span style="font-weight: bold;">a
  windfall gain above and beyond what
  might be minimally expected</span>. This is land rent, and it exists
  even if
  it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
  derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The Georgist main agenda, as earlier noted, is economic justice.
  If one searches the term &#8220;economic justice&#8221; online, the first site
  that will appear is the Georgist website, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">progress.org</a>.
  The starting point
  is that people are entitled to what they earn, but only to what they
  earn.<small></small> The
  fruits of the commons generated in rent might also be distributed to citizens
  equally if not used to finance the general services of
  government. In practice this means the abolition of those taxes that
  represent an unjust capture of one&#8217;s personal property &#8212; taxes
  such as income, sales, and other nuisance taxes. It accepts, to be sure, the
  need to collect user fees, Pigouvian taxes, and perhaps sumptuary (sin)
  taxes. It argues aggressively for the collection of economic rent in
  support of government and, for any remaining surplus, its distribution
  as a citizens&#8217; dividend.&nbsp; The justification for the collection of
  rent has several grounds: </small></p>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>the first is to preclude the entitlement of
      windfall gains to those who have unfairly captured monopoly control of
    parts of what are rightfully the public commons. </small></div>
</li>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A second reason is to
  enhance the efficiency of economic productivity which the failure to
  collect rent prevents. It is not just that monopoly control of commons
  sites drives less attractive and less valuable land into production
  because the primary choices are unavailable; it is also that the use of
  alternative taxes leads to a deadweight loss in the economy which
  reduces the wealth of every citizen except the monopoly titleholder.The
  proper collection of land rent leads to increases in economic
  efficiency in a way that wages are not artificially depressed and more
  opportunities arise in the labor market.</small></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result of these factors
leads to a greater equality in the income of each person. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Pricing resources of nature at their marginal rates is a clearly
understood economic principle. To do otherwise fosters extravagant and
wasteful use of such, or leads to inefficient use of their locations.
Hence both a moral reason &#8212;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the unjust
windfall gain that otherwise
befalls such monopoly titles</span> &#8212; and an economic reason &#8212;
efficiency &#8212;
call for such practices. It is the compelling impetus of politics and
not economic rationality that frustrates the implementation of such
designs. With the advent of greater and more accurate data, as well as
the increased power of computer analysis, there is every reason to
argue for and anticipate the collection of economic rent from every
source where it arises.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
  <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
      are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium of
      forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation to
          users and <br>
                2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                    is really the socially created value. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
      investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
      and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
      to revenue design. <strong>Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing
      the land rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is socially created
      value, which
      is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than allowing
      it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property close by.</strong> User
      fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
      as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
      with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
      ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
      charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
      accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
      and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
      use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
  <p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
      and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with the
      costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom, it
      is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
      level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be linked
      to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption, to the
      full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental ambiences.
      Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing design for
      highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
      The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
      average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68
      billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours
      stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
      times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes
      one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But
      not all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
      time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people to
      impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored
      in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway space. In
      a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a form of land
      rent. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
    and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
    Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>While all landholders will be encouraged to put their land to
its
optimal use, land speculators will be particularly affected by LVT. The
former head of the Town Planning Department of the University of
Queensland, Philip Day, characterises the current lure of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">windfall </span>increases
in land value operating as a standing invitation to "develop" land by
seeking approval for a change of use, irrespective of its environmental
significance and regardless of how such rezoning repeatedly leads to
the environmentally destructive process of urban sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While, at first sight, the
prospect of
sprawling cities with lots of open space and possible greenery might be
appealing from an environmental perspective, a closer examination
should lead to a different conclusion.</span> The inducement to collect
windfall profits (resulting from the failure of society to apply LVT)
encourages some landholders to withhold vacant land from the market and
forces new development to "leapfrog" this land and move further out.
Hence there is an unnecessary outlay in roads, pipelines, power
supplies and other infrastructure which must service a greater area.
Commuting journeys, similarly, must now consume greater resources.
Financially inducing land to be put to its optimal use is not
"flogging" the land, but is rather ensuring land is carefully used and
that we only exploit as much as we properly need.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>A simple model will serve to illustrate. Presently, rail/metro
infrastructure is almost prohibitively expensive because the windfall
benefits are effectively handed over to landowners. To partially recoup
the outlay, authorities are forced to set fares so high as to act as a
disincentive to potential low-impact commuters. ...&nbsp; <a

    It Over Us</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how, over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&#8220;One, political influence; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>two, social importance; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>three, power exercised over tenantry;</small></li>
  <li><small>four, residential enjoyment including what is called
sport; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then, the reform of the
House of Lords has dented the political
influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
with rezoning and the growth in residential/industrial values. In the
UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the average UK building plot &#8211;
at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
landowners each year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and
Southeast, it
is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; She said further that
it is impossible to know how much of this differential is accounted for
by a "hope" factor &#8211; a speculative play on future change of use &#8211; and
how
much represents the premium for land&#8217;s amenity value when it is in such
short supply. But she adds: &#8220;There has certainly been a deal of
strategic holding and buying on
city and town fringes by agricultural owners and farmers. New
development land is usually designated in &#8220;fill-ins&#8221; and close to
existing developments.&#8221;&nbsp; She added further that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span></small><br
