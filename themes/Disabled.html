        Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
        11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
        IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
        and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all
              public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated
              until we consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
              in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
              inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
              as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands,
              gives a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced
              by labor and capital.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
              and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
              this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
              the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed.
              Rent, instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality.
              Labor and capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion
              taken by the state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied
              to public purposes, would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided
              into two portions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div align="left">
          <p> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
                  producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div align="left">
          <p> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
                  in public benefits to all its members.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young
              children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as
              well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while one part
              represents the result of individual effort in production, the other
              represents
              the increased power with which the community as a whole aids the
              individual.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by
              the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce
              inequality as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater
              and greater equality. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

whatever taxes and regulations

While communities would be permitted to tax wages and interest if
they wished, they would find it attractive to do so only if their

financing for communities would be the rental value of land and other
natural opportunities. Because the provision of a worthwhile local
public good generally raises rent by enough to pay for the good,
communities would generally be able to finance themselves with only a
fraction of the rent of land. The rest of rent could provide as a
basic income for all.</small></div>

<small>Yet there has been no disaster of fire or flood, no convulsion

work. So clear, indeed, is it that of the great masses who are
suffering in this country to-day, by far the greater part are honest,

<blockquote>
  <p>What, then, about public goods that have benefits over greater areas? If
    only a few localities are involved, one might expect them to negotiate voluntary
    compacts with reasonable efficiency. "Pork
  barrel" projects--all projects with benefits for only a small region of the
  country--should not be paid for with national taxes. The practice leads to
  the approval of inefficient
  projects as a result of the politicking of those who benefit, and it unjustly
  exploits those
  who do not benefit.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For truly national public goods, other ideas
      must be explored.</span> One of the major national public goods is defense.
      In a perfectly just world, everyone would be so respectful of the rights
      of others, and everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending would
      be desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want public
      defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?</p>
  <p>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
    can be provided by a Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital,
    which makes a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S. requires
    a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it is because
    the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a more attractive
    target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital might reasonably be charged
    for the increase in the defense budget that is needed to make other citizens
    as safe as they would be if that one person's capital were not adding to the
    attractiveness of nation as a target. It would be interesting to know how much
    of the defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per
    year on the value of all assets and contractual rights, to pay the costs of
    defense. The owner assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and if
    anyone wants to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There
    could be a personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption
    for personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of local
    police and courts.</p>
  <p>An even greater share of the federal budget is used for various programs that
    provide help for people with special needs--welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, Social
    Security, unemployment insurance, disaster assistance, etc. Some of these programs
    (social security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation) are funded in part
    by payments by prospective beneficiaries. But all incorporate substantial elements
    of deliberate redistribution.</p>
  <p>In a world that adhered to a classical liberal understanding of justice, there
    would be three sources of funding for people with
  special needs:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1) insurance that those with special needs had
    bought for themselves prior to the onset of their special needs,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2) donations from family, friends and other compassionate
    persons, and</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">3) local public expenditures that would be non-coercively
    financed, because anyone who objected to the financing could leave the locality.</p>
  <p>In a just would, people would ensure, prior to conceiving children, that any
    expensive special needs that their children might have would be paid for, either
    by insurance that the parents would buy, or by voluntary conventions in their
    communities that the community would pay the costs of such needs.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you object that some people would not be able to afford such insurance
    for all their children. If this is true, it implies one of two things.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Either the parents of such children are behaving unjustly by conceiving
          those children, who will either lack what they ought to have or will
      be able to receive it only by the imposition of unjust taxes. </li>
    <li>Or else the parents have been treated unjustly by having started life
      without enough resources to provide for the children that they ought to
      have had
          the chance to bring into the world. I would guess that sometimes the
      first is true, sometimes the second, and sometimes both.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The possibility that prospective parents might
    be unable to afford to provide for the children that they ought to have the chance
    to bring into the world highlights the possible need for a one-time redistribution
    that would give everyone a fair starting point. </span>This does not mean equality
    for ever. It does not necessarily even mean equality at the starting time. What
    it means is allocating initial rights in such a way that we do not mind requiring
    people to pay the costs of their choices, including the choice of conceiving
    children (unless they belong to communities that agree to pay the costs of some
    of their choices).
  </p>
  <p>Whenever a one-time redistribution is proposed, a reaction of many economists
    is, "Yeah, right. Why would anyone one believe that it would be only one time?" What
    would make it reasonable to believe that such a redistribution would be a
    one-time event is its rationale: The recognition that some persons have had
    unfairly
    inadequate starting positions in life, and the determination to end that.
    If the purpose is achieved, there is no rationale for further redistribution,
    unless, at some future time, our society attains a new moral insight that
    implies
    that further redistribution is required. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>
