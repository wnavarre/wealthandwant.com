 Land Question</a> (1881)<a

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, what are the rights of this case? </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To whom rightfully does the soil of Ireland belong? </li>
    <li>Who are justly entitled to its use and to all the benefits that
      flow from its use? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let us settle this question clearly and decisively, before we
    attempt anything else.</p>
  <p>Let me go to the heart of this question by asking another
    question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Has or has not the child
    born in Ireland a right to live?
    There can be but one answer, for no one would contend that it was
    right to drown Irish babies, or that any human law could make it
    right. Well, then, if every human being born in Ireland has a right
    to live in Ireland, these rights must be equal.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If each one has a
    right to live, then no one can have any better right to live than any
    other one. </span>There can be no dispute about this. No one will
    contend
    that it would be any less a crime to drown a baby of an Irish peasant
    woman than it would be to drown the baby of the proudest duchess, or
    that a law commanding the one would be any more justifiable than a
    law commanding the other.</p>
  <p>Since, then, all the Irish people have the same equal right to
    life, it follows that they must all have the same equal right to the
    land of Ireland. If they are all in Ireland by the same equal
    permission of Nature, so that no one of them can justly set up a
    superior claim to life than any other one of them; so that all the
    rest of them could not justly say to any one of them, "You have not
    the same right to live as we have; therefore we will pitch you out of
    Ireland into the sea!" then they must all have the same equal rights
    to the elements which Nature has provided for the sustaining of
    life &#8211; to air, to water, and to land. For to deny the equal right
    to the elements necessary to the maintaining of life is to deny the
    equal right to life. Any law that said, "Certain babies have no right
    to the soil of Ireland; therefore they shall be thrown off the soil
    of Ireland;" would be precisely equivalent to a law that said,
"Certain babies have no right to live; therefore they shall be thrown
    into the sea." And as no law or custom or agreement can justify the
    denial of the equal right to life, so no law or custom or agreement
    can justify the denial of the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>It therefore follows, from the very fact of their existence, that
    the right of each one of the people of Ireland to an equal share in
    the land of Ireland is equal and inalienable: that is to say, that
    the use and benefit of the land of Ireland belong rightfully to the
    whole people of Ireland, to each one as much as to every other; to no
    one more than to any other&#8211;not to some individuals, to the
    exclusion of other individuals; not to one class, to the exclusion of
    other classes; not to landlords, not to tenants, not to cultivators,
    but to the whole people.</p>
  <p>This right is irrefutable and indefeasible. It pertains to and
    springs from the fact of existence, the right to live. No law, no
    covenant, no agreement, can bar it. One generation cannot stipulate
    away the rights of another generation. If the whole people of Ireland
    were to unite in bargaining away their rights in the land, how could
    they justly bargain away the right of the child who the next moment
    is born? No one can bargain away what is not his; no one can
    stipulate away the rights of another. And if the new-born infant has
    an equal right to life, then has it an equal right to land. Its
    warrant, which comes direct from Nature, and which sets aside all
    human laws or title-deeds, is the fact that it is born.</p>
  <p>Here we have a firm, self-apparent principle from which we may
    safely proceed. The land of Ireland does not belong to one individual
    more than to another individual; to one class more than to another
    class; to one generation more than to the generations that come
    after. It belongs to the whole people who at the time exist upon
    it. ...<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html"> <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In the very centers of our
civilization today are want and
suffering enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his
eyes and steel his nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to
relieve it? Supposing the prayer were heard, and at the behest with
which the universe sprang into being there should glow in the sun a
greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor the soil; that
for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring up, and the
seed that now increases fifty-fold should increase a hundredfold!
Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever
benefit would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming
through the material universe could be utilized only through land.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And land, being private property, the
classes that now monopolize the
bounty of the Creator would monopolize all the new bounty. Land
owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase, but wages
would still tend to the starvation point!</span></small><br>
<br>
<small> This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a
fact of experience. We know it because we have seen it. Within our
own times, under our very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in
all, and through all; that Power of which the whole universe is but
the manifestation; that Power which maketh all things, and without
which is not anything made that is made, has increased the bounty
which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility of nature had
been increased. </small></div>

steam for the service of mankind.

whispered the secret that compels the lightning to bear a message
around the globe. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In every direction have the laws of matter been
revealed; in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron
and fingers of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has
been precisely the same as an increase in the fertility of nature. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
has been the result? Simply that land owners get all the gain.
The wonderful discoveries and inventions of our century have neither
increased wages nor lightened toil. The effect has simply been to
make the few richer; the many more helpless! </span>Can it be that the
gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated with impunity? Is it
a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings while greed
rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few are
surfeited? Turn to history, and on every page may be read the lesson
that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that follows
injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this
state of things continue? May we even say, &#8220;After us the
deluge!&#8221; Nay; the pillars of the state are trembling even now,
and the very foundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up
forces that glow underneath. The struggle that must either revivify,
or convulse in ruin, is near at hand, if it be not already begun. The
fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers
born of progress, forces have entered the world that will either
compel us to a higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation,
as civilization after civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It
is the delusion which precedes destruction that sees in the popular
unrest with which the civilized world is feverishly pulsing only the
passing effect of ephemeral causes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Between
democratic ideas and the
aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable
conflict. </span>Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may
be
seen arising. We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them
to tramp. We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public
schools and then refusing them the right to earn an honest living. <span

cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then

Nic Tideman:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html">The Case
for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1)
every person has a right to himself or herself, and <br>
2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">all persons have
equal rights to the natural opportunities that are not embodied in
persons. </span><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The first premise leads to the
conclusion that taxing
people according to the products of their efforts or the products of
their saving can only be just if people voluntarily agree,
individually, to be subject to such taxes.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing land, on the
other hand, does not involve such an intrusion on individual
rights.</span>&nbsp; In fact, taxing land is a way equalizing the
advantages
of access to land, as required by the second premise.
</small><br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">equal rights
of all to land </span>may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent. This argument represents a refusal to make a distinction
that begs to be made.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The first
principle of economic justice is
that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; While some scholars have
asserted that people have rights to them&shy;selves but not to their
talents, this is nonsensical.&nbsp; Without talents, there is no
self.&nbsp; Talents are fundamentally different from land.&nbsp; The
equal rights of all to land can consistently be asserted while still
asserting that every person has right to the use of his or her talents.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The ethical case for
taxing land is based on two premises.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
controversial since the end of slavery,</span> so I will simply assume
that
this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Justice requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all
persons to
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; At the level of relations among nations,
this requires every nation to determine whether it is using more than
its share of natural opportunities, and if it is using more than its
share, to compensate other nations that therefore have less than their
shares. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>An additional ethical reason for recognizing equal rights to
natural
opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;
Nations have arisen through violence.&nbsp; While the world condemns
violence among nations, it has persistently acquiesced to regimes
established by violence.&nbsp; The greater the natural resources of a
nation, the greater is the attraction to potential tyrants of the
possibility of taking over the nation.&nbsp; If the world is able to
establish an understanding, backed up by the threat of economic
boycotts, that nations have an obligation to share the value of natural
opportunities in proportion to population, and that people are free to
leave nations that they find unacceptable, then the return to violent
appropriation of power will be removed.&nbsp; As long as we accept the
continued exercise of disproportionate power over natural opportunities
by those who acquired that power through violence, we will have
difficulty persuading potential usurpers of power that we will not
accept their conquests. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>It is sometimes suggested that collecting all of the rental
value of
land is not feasible because it would bankrupt the financial system,
which uses land as collateral for loans.&nbsp; The use of land as
collateral for loans is a fact that would need to be weighed carefully
in working out a feasible transition to a system of collecting nearly
all rent publicly, but it does not make public collection of rent
impossible.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Public collection of
the rental value of land, and
the consequent elimination of other taxes, would represent
redistribution from the old to the young and unborn.&nbsp; It is
equivalent to saying that each person enters the world with a more
complete right to himself or herself (to the extent the income and
value added taxes are reduced) and with a right to an equal share of
the gifts of nature.</span>&nbsp; If we are to acknowledge that every
newborn
person does have such rights, we must reduce the wealth of previously
born persons, corresponding to the expectation of collecting the shares
of rent of the newborns.&nbsp; The question that then arises is, Who
should pay?</small><br>
<br>
<small>This can be interpreted as a question of who should pay the cost
of an
accident.&nbsp; We have had a moral accident.&nbsp; We have been living
under the delusion that it is possible for a person to have a
respectable claim to a disproportionate share of the gifts of
nature.&nbsp; This is akin to the delusion under which humanity long
lived, that it was possible for one human being to own another.&nbsp;
In recovering from such a delusion, we need to disappoint some
people.&nbsp; If not the slave owners, then the people who compensate
the slave owners.&nbsp; If not the land owners, then the people who
compensate the land owners.&nbsp; I propose that the cost be divided
among land owners, shareholders in financial institutions that made
loans with land as collateral, and owners of wealth in general. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Morality requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all to
the
gifts of nature.&nbsp; Doing so is feasible and promotes efficiency as
well.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to landowners.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege.<strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to
some groups and not others.<strong>&nbsp; ... </strong></small><br>
<br>

The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.

 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small><small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read the whole
