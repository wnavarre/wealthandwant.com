  <div style="text-align: left;">Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land
      as a Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">excludes</span> many things, too, that are colloquially
        called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by which many
        cities are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
        properly land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
        land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other uses.&nbsp; Expanding
        cities take farmland from producing food and fiber, much of it for the
        expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow water near cities
        is taken away from anglers and sailors and viewers and ecologists, who
        now routinely&nbsp; organize to prevent it being "made" away with.&nbsp; Drained
        and filled wetlands are taken away from endangered species, as well as
        from their primal role as filters protecting coastal waters from river
        trash and pollutants.&nbsp; Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists,
        it has taken militant environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing
        in their struggle to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists
        and their "way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are
        now coming to terms with each other, after decades of mutual shunning.&nbsp; Too
        many modern economists, however, still use their "way of thinking" to
        seal out important new evidence that doesn't fit the model. </small><br>
      <br>
        <small>Capital (K) is that which has been produced but not yet used up.&nbsp; Capital
      is formed by human thrift, forbearance, investment and production.&nbsp; Only
      after mankind forms and makes capital does it bear much likeness to land,
      in that they coexist.&nbsp; Ordinary micro-economics obscures the differences
      because it deals mainly with relations of coexistence, ignoring the continual
      formation and destruction of capital, ignoring time and relations of sequence.&nbsp; Thus
      it excludes from its purview one of the prime differences between land
      and capital.&nbsp; The life of capital, like that of people, is marked
      by major sacraments of birth, growth, aging and death - all missing from
      micro theory. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Economic life is a cavalcade
      in which the birth and death of capital are dated events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Micro
      deals mainly with how existing resources are allocated at a moment in time,
      not how they originate, grow, flourish, reproduce, age, die, and decompose.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Capital occupies space; land <i>is </i>space.&nbsp; In common micro
      theory, resources and markets come together at a point not just in time
      but in space.&nbsp; Again, it excludes from its purview one of the prime
      qualities of land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small></small><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">6.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
          is ironic that economists purport or affect to ape the methods of physics,
          when they delete both space and time from their subject.&nbsp; If they
    have borrowed from physics, they have taken the form without the substance. </font></small></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <small>For the reasons given, alone, land and capital are mutually exclusive. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There
        are, however, nine more, which follow.</span> ... </small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><b></b>Land as "site" (location plus extension) does not normally
      wear out, depreciate, spoil, obsolesce, nor get used up by human activities
      incident to occupancy and production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast, capital depreciates from time and use,
      routinely and by nature.</span>&nbsp; After being formed, it must be conserved
      from entropy by continual maintenance, repair, remodeling, safeguarding
      against theft and fire, and so on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>&nbsp; Like our
      own bodies, it returns to dust; <span style="font-weight: bold;">land is
      the dust to which it returns</span>.&nbsp; Inventories are depleted; moving
      parts wear out; fixed capital depreciates with use and time. ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>No one can get more land without others keeping less.&nbsp; One
      can acquire more capital by forming it through saving and investing.&nbsp; One
      can consume more by working more, while others work no less.&nbsp; Land
      is different: it is the most common basis of market power, therefore. &nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>When demand grows for land in a specific area or neighborhood, land
      cannot immigrate to meet the higher demand.&nbsp; It is true that land
      elsewhere can be converted to the specific land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">use </span>that is demanded.&nbsp; Some micro theorists
      argue that this makes land as "mobile" as anything else, equating land
      and capital.&nbsp; It dovetails with and reinforces their paradigm centered
      on "the firm," a unit that can add unlimited inputs of all kinds in the
      long run, and among which competition drives all profits to zero.&nbsp; This
      rationalization overlooks the hoary adage of real estate: "value depends
      on three factors, location, location, and location." What happens then
      is<b> </b>not that supply rises to meet higher demand, but ground rent
      rises.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land is not convertible into capital, nor <i>vice versa.&nbsp; </i>Exchange
      of land for capital has misled many into equating them, but only through
      inadvertence and the fallacy of composition.&nbsp; Exchange is not interchange:
      exchange does not change the quantity of either land or capital.&nbsp; Capital
      is convertible into any other form of capital each time it turns over,
      by using Capital Consumption Allowances, the proceedings of turnover, to
      hire people actually to produce new capital.&nbsp; Capital may also be
      disinvested and consumed, or augmented by new saving and investment.&nbsp; None
      of those is true of land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land is indispensable to life, hence to economic activity.&nbsp; The
      same is generally true of labor and capital, but less "absolutely".&nbsp; Land
      can exist perfectly well without labor or capital, and support timber and
      wildlife, but labor and capital cannot exist at all without at least some
      land, and often a great deal of land.&nbsp; Substitution is limited.&nbsp; It
      will not do just to have 57 varieties of labor, or of capital.&nbsp; There
      must be at least some land.&nbsp; Remember, land includes space itself,
      and a time-slot in it.&nbsp; It includes air and water, the environment
      and the ecology and all original matter itself.&nbsp; Without land there
      is nothing.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> Coupling&nbsp; this
      with the non-reproduceability of land, and its fixity, land is distinctive.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Homelessness," a modem plague, is essentially
    landlessness.&nbsp; A popular ditty from the 1930s includes the catchy line, "If
    you can't pay the rent, you can live in a tent," but you can't do even that
    without a campsite.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why modern economists have so little
    to say about homelessness.&nbsp; Joblessness they have dismissed as part
    of the vital economic function of "job-seeking," with which they have persuaded
    at least themselves.&nbsp; The next logical step is that the person sleeping
    in the doorway is not really homeless, but just engaged in the vital market
    function of "home-seeking".&nbsp; Rather than seem totally absurd they are
    simply silent, except to stress the "exclusionary principle" of private property
    as the bedrock of their system, and their system as a panacea. ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Land is traditionally subject to a host of legal and customary limits
  on use and ownership.&nbsp; Covenants are found in land titles: seldom in titles
  to cars or canned goods.&nbsp; Divided ownership is common, there is so much
  about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are easements through, air rights
  over, mineral rights under, and neighbors and zoning all around any parcel
  of land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is unavoidably a social process, there is
  no other way.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A large share of the more valuable land in cities is held by estates.&nbsp; Public
  and eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are preferentially tax exempt and often
  without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water licenses are held subject
  to "use it or lose it" traditions leading to appalling waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting
  licenses are highly political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with
  the characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of non-economic
  pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Amassing land is always done, can only be done, by shrinking the holdings
  of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to have more then B,
  C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other way.&nbsp; A can amass
  more capital by saving, creating new capital, leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with
  as much as before.&nbsp; A can increase his labor income by working longer,
  or harder, or smarter, producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He
  and she together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is reproducible,
  and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land, however, means just one
  thing: bumping others.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by all
  with no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or Beethoven,
  or understanding physics is any less because at the same time millions of others
  have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and science are the common property
  of mankind, open to all who care to acquire them.&nbsp; The creative producer's
  pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom he shares.&nbsp; The gratification
  is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp; The contrast with landholding is nearly
  total.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small></small>  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>35.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Paraphrased

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
    <small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not, therefore,
    a threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
    or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with others'
    doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a particular limited
    market, but glutting one market increases real demand for the products of
    other markets, and raises the real value of others' incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing
    land, however, has to deprive others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated
    holding and control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
    of those left out.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can get
  land is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced as the
  solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is mere temporizing
  because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and demand grow, land rents
  rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the problem is not production, but
  distribution".&nbsp; There is no production; only distribution. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read
