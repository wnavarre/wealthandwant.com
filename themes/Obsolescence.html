<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Buildings, be they residential or
      commercial, are different from land. While land's value rises over time &#8212; with
      increases in
      population, with public investment &#8212; the value of a building  declines
      over time. (A June, 2006, Federal Reserve Board study pegs annual depreciation
      on single family homes at 1.5%.) Homeowners at some level
      know this: they spend their money or their leisure time combatting the
      deterioration
      that
      comes
      with
      time
      to all things manmade &#8212; a house's systems deteriorate, the technology
      and configuration and collection of rooms which may have been the newest
      and most
      preferred at
      the time the house was built are superseded by newer technology, or a different
      set of rooms, or a better set of materials. </p>
  <p>More extreme weather patterns may call for the use of new technologies or
      new standards in order for buildings  to better withstand wind or even earthquake
      activity. Homes which were built to older standards may tend to be less insurable,
      as the FIRE sector seeks to minimize its risk.</p>
  <p>Neighborhoods change. The central business district of a small city might
      have consisted of two-story buildings in 1950, but by 2000, they might have been
      replaced by four-story buildings. The neighborhood diner which might have been
      highly appropriate 50 years ago now represents an underuse of the site. </p>
  <p>When our incentives are such that landholder have no particular encouragement
      to redevelop obsolete buildings, one of the results is sprawl. Another is a
      less healthy marketplace, with fewer jobs, fewer products available, fewer
      competitors, higher prices. Fix the incentives, so that landholders are encouraged,
      both by carrot and by stick, to redevelop their land, to keep it near its highest
      and best use. The healthiest cities are those that are being constantly redeveloped.
      It needn't cost the public sector anything. Just remove the disincentives to
      redevelop the sites (by reducing or eliminating the millage rate on the buildings)
      and provide the incentive to put them to their highest and best use (by increasing
      the millage rate on the land itself).</p>

        Taxing Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>As with negative
externalities, the fact that labor and capital are not
perfectly mobile means that not all of the effects of activities with
positive externalities are reflected in land values.&nbsp; And to the
extent that labor and capital are affected, negative effects are likely
to be more prominent than positive effects.&nbsp; Consider
structures.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">If an existing
structure is efficient for the current
pattern of surrounding land uses, and if new use of surrounding land
raises the value of the land under the structure, then the structure
can be expected to thereby become suboptimal.&nbsp; The pre-existing
structure is generally not as intensive a use of land as would have
been chosen with knowledge of the new activity.&nbsp; Therefore the
economic life of the pre-existing structure (the time until it is
efficient to demolish it) is shortened by the new activity that
increases land value.&nbsp; Even though rent per square foot of built
space rises, the rise is not enough to offset the increase in land
value, which presumes the newly efficient size for a structure, thereby
reducing the amount of the current return that is attributable to the
existing structure and pushing the structure toward obsolescence.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>A similar phenomenon occurs with respect to the personal value
that
people attach to locations, what might be called &#8216;location-specific
human capital&#8217;.&nbsp; If all persons had equal demands for all
locations, there would be no location-specific human capital.&nbsp; But
incomes, tastes and personal histories differ, leading to differing
personal values for locations.&nbsp; Famil&shy;iarity with a location
tends to lead people to attach a special value to it, a value that
tends to be lost if the characteristics of the location change.&nbsp;
Thus a change in land use that raises surrounding land values will
generally reduce the location-specific human capital of the residents
of that area.&nbsp; One example of this phenomenon occurs when a
neighborhood is &#8216;gentrified&#8217;, and the prior residents of modest means
can no longer afford to live there and must seek other housing options
that are less attractive to them than the opportunities they
lost.&nbsp; This represents a reduction in their location-specific
human capital.&nbsp; </small><small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>As has been mentioned before, <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
valorem</span> taxes by their very nature put a premium on
obsolescence. It is in the power of the Federal Government to convert
the ad valorem tax into an incentive tax, a tax on obsolescence. </small><small><small><big><big><small><a

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value. <small> <strong>... </strong></small></p>
  <p>But &#8212; and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
      of taxation &#8212; Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return
      from his land, must improve it. Unless he is satisfied with a small income
      from
      it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the community chooses
      to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best building the
      location will warrant. The rents of this building will be his in their
      entirety, not
      one dollar of them being taken from him by taxation. If he is not prepared
      or not willing to do this he would probably find it more profitable, before
      he leaves the country, to sell the land to some one of the many persons
      who are eager to build upon it. It will always be salable, although not
      by any
      means at present figures.</p>
  <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
      the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
      policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium is placed
      upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy penalty
      is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
      depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
      with the land.</p>
  <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put up
      a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin which
      now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and while paying
      a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby enabled
      to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
      is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
      amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
      and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
      letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
      till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it?</p>
  <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
      making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it from
      the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.</p>
  <p>Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better
      and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores, more employment
      for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
      an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a public
      revenue adequate to all real public needs.</p>
  <p>What a contrast to the existing plan of pouring public money into the laps
      of individual landowners to their own moral disadvantage and that of their
      children, as well as the economic disadvantage of their neighbors, while constantly
      cudgeling the civic brains, straining the public credit, impoverishing widows
      and orphans, and increasing the exactions from every citizen and corporation
      that can be caught, in the effort to raise more and more money to bestow upon
      the same beneficiaries. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is equally important to<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
use the "Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.</span>
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">the residual,
if any, is
building value.</span></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuing one lot or parcel this

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using this method, I valued
Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>Yes, I really said "tripled." <span style="font-weight: bold;">By
his methods, buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Besides
depreciation and technological obsolescence, many buildings suffered
severe "locational obsolescence," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using the building-residual method
requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. The conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure, just as the old single-tax campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort.&nbsp; ... <a

old &#8220;junker&#8221; buildings, on the eve of demolition, is listed as higher
than the land under them. This betrays the erroneous use of the
&#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of separating land from building values. It
should be obvious that the old junker has no residual value: that is
why it is being junked. Junking is continuous in enclaves of high value
like Kenilworth, Illinois, or Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;<span

startling a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When you buy an old junker to
tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Try that in Manhattan. When the
visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>

location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100%

<small>SUMMARY&nbsp; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>One obvious problem with the
land-residual approach is that
many buildings would not be rebuilt in their existing form.
</b>Occupancy use changes over time. In Lower Manhattan and many
other inner-city areas, industrial factories, commercial loft
buildings and even office buildings on Wall Street have been
gentrified into residential properties. After New York City's near
bankruptcy in 1975 over 40,000 manufacturing spaces in Manhattan were
shifted from commercial to residential purposes. A similar conversion
of industrial structures to residential or high-density commercial
use is found in most large American cities. It is part of the
economy's de-industrialization (euphemized as "the postindustrial
economy"), as described for instance in Robert Fitch's <i>The
Assassination of New York</i>. As formerly commercial and industrial
districts have changed their character, site values have skyrocketed.
That was all part of the Regional Plan developed early in the 20th
century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many sites are worth more when
they can be delivered vacant, any
buildings are torn down, so that developers can start with a bare
site. Buildings left standing are given new uses; most people would
not want to reproduce these buildings as they are. For instance,
Manhattan's highest-rent district until the World Trade Center
bombing of September 11, 2001, was Tribeca, the downtown <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">TRI</span>angle
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">BE</span>low <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">CA</span>nal Street into which
artists and other individuals
(including myself) seeking large roomy spaces at low prices moved in
the late 1980s. These buildings had lost their value after New York
City almost went bankrupt and industry began to migrate. Many
landlords simply walked away from their properties and let them
revert to the City, which auctioned them off at distress prices. ...<a href="../docs/Hudson_Lies.html"> read
