      If our incentive permit it to remain underused, the result will be urban

    Agricultural land on the fringes is not particularly valuable as agricultural

    tax. (Most farmers have a lot more value in their buildings and equipment
    than in their land; Georgists would remove the taxation from capital.) But
    urban land values in the central business district are much higher: sometimes
    as much as $250,000,000 per acre &#8212; 100,000 times what a typical agricultural
    acre
    is. Use that prime land fully. And even in a small city,  an acre downtown,
    properly developed, can save 10 acres on the fringe.</p>

and Efficiency</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In theory, land speculation can either improve or worsen
economic
efficiency.&nbsp; The way that land speculation can improve efficiency
is by preventing the premature development of land at suboptimal
intensity.&nbsp; If land in a particular region is destined to rise in
value at a rapid rate and few people realize this, then in the absence
of speculation in land, people would tend to build structures that
would turn out not to have been worth building once the higher value of
land became known.&nbsp; In retrospect it would be seen to have been
more efficient to leave land undeveloped until its value rose, and then
develop it at a higher intensity.&nbsp; The possibility of profitable
speculation in land would induce those who could foresee the future
higher value of land to buy land and hold it unused until its high
value became generally known.&nbsp; In the process, the inefficient
premature development of land at a sub-optimal intensity would be
prevented. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is little evidence of inefficiency from premature land
development.&nbsp; If there were such evidence, it would take the form
of recently constructed buildings being demolished for more extensive
development, or possibly, in less extreme and less obvious cases, new
development surrounded by recent, substantially less extensive
development that could have been just as extensive as the new
development if only the developers had waited a little longer.&nbsp;
Examples of the first type of evidence are quite rare.&nbsp; Examples
of the second type would be easy to miss, but still there seems to be
no reason to suppose that they represent a problem of efficiency as
widespread as the problem of indefinitely deferred development induced
by the winner&#8217;s curse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The second reason for believing that deferred development
induced by
the winner&#8217;s curse is more of a problem than premature development
induced by a lack of foresight is that the latter problem can more
easily be resolved by new markets.&nbsp; If land should come to be
taxed so heavily that people stopped speculating in land, and if it
then transpired that people often lost money on their investments in
developing land because they underestimated the rate at which land
values would rise, then there would be a potential private market for
good predictions of the rates at which land values would rise.&nbsp; A
person who could foresee future rises in land values (a good speculator
in today&#8217;s markets) would have a comparative advantage in selling
insurance against a rise in land values, and hence in land taxes, that
would make current development unprofitable.&nbsp; Thus, in making land
speculation unprofitable, land taxation would redirect the energies of
those who believed they could predict rises in land values, away from
buying and holding land that they believed would rise in value, and
toward selling insurance against rises in land values where they
believed that there would be none.&nbsp; People would be discouraged
from building where land values were foreseen to rise rapidly, by the
unavailability of reasonably priced insurance against rises in land
taxes.&nbsp; Thus the potential development of a market for insurance
against rises in land values makes it unnecessary to maintain land
speculation as a mechanism to secure efficient deferral of
development.&nbsp; The benefits of eliminating the inefficient deferral
of development that is caused by the winner&#8217;s curse can be secured
without foregoing the benefits of redirecting development, based on
private knowledge of where land values will rise rapidly. <a

    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, land will not be transferred by those who have the right to use
    it unless some payment is made. The possibility of payments for transferring
    the right to use land raises the specter of land speculators receiving large
    undeserved profits while holding economic development hostage. Is land speculation
    an unavoidable
  concomitant of a market economy?</p>
  <p>It is important to understand first that withholding land from development
    can be a productive activity. Land that is developed prematurely will not
    be improved to the extent that is efficient when the land is ripe for development,
    because that later development would require the sacrifice of the earlier,
    inefficient improvements. To insure that resources are not wasted on premature
    development of land, it must be possible for those who make development decisions
    to profit from making them well. This perspective on land speculation was
    developed
    by Richard T. Ely (1920). ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the
