<blockquote>
  <p>When choice sites are put to their highest and best use, the owners of the
    property benefit immediately. But equally important, unless we are truly a nation
      of individualists, is that the entire community benefits from intense use of
      centrally located properties. Can we count the ways?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The community benefits because well-developed downtown sites usually
        have office, retail or residential space, each of which meets market
      demand. Everyone
        needs a place to live, and many people &#8212; though certainly not all of
        us, at various phases in our lives &#8212; would prefer to live close
        to our work, to cultural amenities, to goods and services we depend on.
        We'd
        rather
        walk than drive, and we appreciate the benefits of living in the center
        of things.</p>
    <p>2. The community benefits because most of us need places to work. For many
        kinds of jobs, particularly specialized ones, we need either to be with others
        who are doing the same kind of work, and/or accessible to our customers, and
        only a centrally located site can provide that effectively.</p>
    <p>3. The community benefits because some of us want to open our own businesses.
        It might be the first of its kind, supplying a good or service not yet being
        provided to that market, or it might be a second, or fifth, or tenth or fiftieth,
        the presence of which helps to keep prices down for the consumer, as vendors
        compete to meet consumer preferences.</p>
    <p>4. The community benefits when land is put to its highest and best use because
        for many pieces of land, housing is the highest and best use.</p>
    <p>5. The community benefits when land is put to its highest and best use because
        centrally located land, well used, prevents or retards the development of
        agricultural and wilderness land on the fringes. Existing infrastructure
        is fully used, and there is no need to extend infrastructure into sparsely
        populated areas not yet served. Rural land is preserved.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We are land creatures, even in the computer age. We all need land, to live
    on and to work on, and when prime land is used at less than its highest and
    best use, we are forced to use more time, use more fuel, create more pollution,
    to get from good paying work to affordable land</p>

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
      blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
      from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
      present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
      on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
            be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
            economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
            The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
            of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging all
            the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value of
            land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
            to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of such
            a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
            land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of
            former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
            to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
            after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will
            be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
      land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
      land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
      most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
      to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
      attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
      would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
      field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
      have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
          of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his
      neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
      warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.

    Cannot Shift The Tax on Land Values</a> (1887)<a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"></a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A VERY common objection to the
proposition to concentrate all taxes on Land Values is that the
landowner would add the increased tax on the value of his land to the
rent that must be paid by his tenants. It is this notion that increased
Taxation of Land Values would fall upon the users, not upon the owners
of land, that more perhaps than anything else prevents men from seeing
the far-reaching and beneficent effects of doing away with the taxes
that now fall upon labor or the products of labor, and taking for
public use those values that attach to land by reason of the growth and
progress of society. </small><br>
<br>
<small>That taxes levied upon Land Values, or, to use the
politico-economic term, taxes levied upon rent, do not fall upon the
user of land, and cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant
is conceded by all economists of reputation. However much they may
dispute as to other things, there is no dispute upon this point.
Whatever flimsy reasons any of them may have deemed it expedient to
give why the tax on rent should not be more resorted to, they all admit
that the taxation of rent merely diminishes the profits of the
landowner, cannot be shifted on the user of land, cannot add to prices,
nor check production. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But while the Taxation of Land
Values cannot raise rents, it
would, especially in a country like this, where there is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">so much
valuable land unused</span>, tend strongly to lower them. In all our
cities,
and through all the country, <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is
much land which is not used, or
not put to its best use, because it is held at high prices by men who
do not want to, or who cannot, use it themselves, but who are holding
it in expectation of profiting by the increased value which the
growth of population will give to it in the future.</span> Now the
effect of
the Taxation of Land Values would be to compel these men to seek
tenants or purchasers. Land upon which there is no taxation even a
poor man can easily hold for higher prices, for land eats nothing.
But put heavy taxation upon it, and even a rich man will be driven to
seek purchasers or tenants, and to get them he will have to put down
the price he asks, instead of putting it up; for it is by asking
less, not by asking more, that those who have anything they are
forced to dispose of must seek customers. Rather than continue to pay
heavy taxes upon land yielding him nothing, and from the future
increase in value of which he could have no expectation of profit,
since increase in value would mean increased taxes, he would be glad
to give it away or let it revert to the State. Thus the dogs in the
manger, who all over the country are withholding land that they
cannot use themselves from men who would be glad to use it, would be
forced to let go their grasp. To tax Land Values up to anything like
their full amount would be to utterly destroy speculative values, and
to diminish all rents into which this speculative element enters. And
how groundless it is to think that landlords who have tenants could
shift a tax on Land Values upon their tenants can be readily seen
from the effect upon landlords who have no tenants. It is when
tenants seek for land, not when landlords seek for tenants, that rent
goes up. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> To put the matter in a form in
which it can be easily
understood, let us take two cases. The one, a country where the
available land is all in use, and the competition of tenants has
carried rents to a point at which the tenant pays the landlord all he
can possibly earn save just enough to barely live. The other, a
country where all the available land is not in use and the rent that
the landlord can get from the tenant is limited by the terms on which
the tenant can get access to unused land. How, in either case, if the
tax were imposed upon Land Values (or rent), could the landlord
compel the tenant to pay it?&nbsp; ...<a

<blockquote>
  <p>Growing barley is a worthy goal (especially if you enjoy a little beer). So
    is growing corn. It would be great to raise as much of each as anyone wants,
    but the Earth has its limits. A choice and a decision are required. People
    invented (or stumbled into) the discipline of economics to help with such hard
    choices, and to
  console ourselves that we are doing the right thing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The hardest choices are those regarding
  land use, because there is just so much. We can build more houses, cars, and
  boats, write more music and drama, spawn and educate more people, but we cannot
  make another
  Hudson Valley.</span></p>
  <p>Barley grows on cheap land, and the demand is limited, so the best barley
    land is used for growing corn.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Economics reconciles
    the competing demands and rationalizes the outcome. It defines the "highest
    and best use" of land as that yielding the highest net gain, the excess of
    revenues over costs. </span>Economists include non-cash "service flows" among "revenues," although
    they bear watching: sometimes they forget. Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">economics
    shows how the market sorts and arranges land uses, giving us a corn belt, a
    wheat belt, and a cotton belt.</span> Economists pride themselves on this achievement.
    (Some preen themselves too much, as we will see, and pride goeth before a fall.)</p>
  <p>By the same logic, irrigated crops take land from dry-farmed crops; orchards
    take land from irrigated row crops; housing takes land from orchards and groves;
    commerce takes land from housing.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the rich take land from the poor, provoking sympathy, strong rhetoric,
    and occasionally effective rear-guard resistance to such changes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actually,
    a well-oiled market is often quite democratic. People of moderate income, by
    crowding, can outcompete those of high income for the same land</span>, as
    when a Sears or Wal-mart takes the best commercial sites from a Nordstroms
    or Broadway; or when an old estate is subdivided into five lots per acre. This,
    too, provokes negative rhetoric, but developers know how to make hay out of
    this, and mincemeat of their opposition. At this point developers become populists
    and accuse preservationists and environmentalists of snobbery and elitism.
    We need an answer for that one if environmentalists are going to command enough
    popular support to win, and hold the gains. Of this, more later.<small><small><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">  <b></b></a></small></small></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other worthy goals that conflict are open
      space and water conservation.</span> A major problem in an arid land is that
      much wide open space guzzles up water. Conserving open space and conserving
      water conflict directly. Green grass uses more water per acre than almost
      any farm crop except rice (and rice returns part of it downstream). In cities
      most water is used not for swimming pools or toilets or washing machines,
      but for sprinkling lawns. Cemeteries, golf courses, horse-pastures, parks,
      freeway banks, and the spacious tax-exempt grounds of institutions are the
      greatest water junkies outside of farming itself, which of course takes much
      more than all cities.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Something has to give. Thus far it has been
      wetlands that gave. </span>Once, perhaps, we had too much wetland, but that
      was long ago. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We cannot accommodate all those uses, and
      save wetlands too, just by having restaurants stop serving water, or putting
      bricks in toilet tanks. Those are just token or "Goo-Goo" measures for parlor
      reformers; they distract us from real problems, and substitute for real solutions.
      What is the highest and best use of water? Wetlands, maybe; more golf courses,
      maybe not. But we need a rule to gauge "highest and best use." Is it the
      market? Read on.</span></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div align="left"><small>&nbsp; The question I am
              assigned is whether the taxable capacity of land without buildings is
              up to the job of financing cities, counties, and schools. Will the
              revenue be enough? The answer is "yes."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;The universal state and local revenue problem today
              is whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away.
              It is
              exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
              California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
              and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
              figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
          one of them.)</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based
              on land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear
              of
              driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
              certainly will not drive away the land. However high the tax rate,
              not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
              town. The
              only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is that
              it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people think
              that is
        bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;In other cases, industries
occupy land of high value that
is wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it
has not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias
of assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to
improved "lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of
wholesale discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis,
Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the

location</a>, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To
make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage.</span> Exempting
buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;I once wrote a long

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Might the PTS fall heavily on low-income land
holders and elderly homeowners? The land-rich, money-poor old widow
could suffer if society were to levy sites. Eventho' the vast majority
of poor people would come out ahead, there probably will be the rare
exception. To deal with "the widow on a valuable lot", the new policy
could include <span style="font-weight: bold;">deferments.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as some poor could pay more, some
rich could pay less, such as the
owners of a skyscraper that'd be the highest (literally) and best use
of a site. While a PTS could be a tax break for a few, the intent of
the shift is not so much to whittle away fortunes as it is to promote
prosperity, equity, and sustainability.</span> Were society to attain
such
goals, letting some fortunes escape unscathed is a small price to pay.
Also, putting a site to best use, while profitable, also benefits the
community by providing convenient employment, bringing money into the
local economy, and by precluding less efficient development, such as
sprawl. <strong>... </strong></small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures. ...</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Nobel-winning economist
William Vickrey said that the property
tax is actually two different taxes (Vickrey 1991). That is because
buildings are capital, not land, in the economic sense &#8211; even
if, in most legal codes, there is no distinction between land and
improvements made to it which are all lumped together as &#8216;landed
property&#8217; or real estate. Buildings and other improvements to
land all depreciate over time unless further capital is expended.
Eventually the market value of such <i>improvements</i> may become
negative, owing to the costs that would need to be incurred by
someone wishing to redevelop the site for an alternative use. But
that does not necessarily take away the rental value of the
<i>site</i>.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much urban blight is caused by
these so-called &#8216;brown
field&#8217; vacant and under-used sites. However they are often in
valuable locations, with good transport connections. It may be that
owners are speculating that land prices will rise and enable them to
sell at greater profit in the future than now, or it may be that
there is genuinely no market for sites in a particular location
unless the cost of remediation is subsidised as a form of public
investment. Such investment, according to Vickrey and other followers
of Henry George, can be entirely funded from LVT. In a lecture given
in 1991, first published last year, Vickrey claimed:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;Cities have the
capacity to be fully self-financing without dependence on either
federal assistance or on general taxes that are unrelated to benefits
received.&#8221;</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proviso, according to Vickrey,
is to replace the tax on
buildings with a tax on land value alone &#8211; LVT:-</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>&#8220;The property tax
combines one of the best and one of the worst taxes we have. The
portion that falls on sites or land values is the only major tax that
is reasonably free of distortionary effects and is not intolerably
regressive&#8221;.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing
buildings and work done to improve them discourages such
work. Un-taxing them and taxing land more highly, irrespective of its
actual state of development but based upon its </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">highest and best
immediate potential use</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">, will
encourage owners to maintain their
sites and buildings in such a way as to maximise their income. </span><i>A
remote site or one with conservation or other restrictions will have
a low site value, hence attract low taxes, whereas a high value city
centre derelict site will very soon be redeveloped.</i> The extra
property tax revenue from extending the tax base to sites that are
currently under-taxed (because the tax is based primarily on
building/rental value not site/owner value), ensures public
infrastructure projects can be funded without resource to general
taxes or excessive borrowing on the financial markets</small>.&nbsp; <span

own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story

tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The Taxable Surplus
    of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable surplus is also what you
        can tax without driving land into the wrong use.</span> It is not enough
        that the land supply is fixed: a tax must not force underuse or other
        misuse of the fixed supply. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of taxing rent
    is that it does not change the ranking of land uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let
    me explain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    In a free market, the function of rent is to sort and arrange land uses:
    landowners allocate land to those uses yielding the most net product, or
    rent. Economists have shown (and you can easily see) that this is socially
    advantageous: the net product is the excess of revenue over all costs, so
    land yielding the highest rent is adding its utmost to the national product. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    When you base your tax on the net product (or rent), the ranking of rival
    land uses remains the same after-tax as it was before-tax. That is, if use "A" yields
    20% more rent than use "B", and a tax takes 50% of the rent, then use A still
    yields the owner 20% more after-tax than use B, and the owner still prefers
    use A. We will see below, (<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">Section
    D</a>), that when you tax something other than rent (say the Gross Revenue,
    G), you will drive the land into less intensive uses, or out of use altogether. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A related advantage of taxing rent
    is that you can often levy the tax on the land's <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>to
    yield rent, regardless of what use the owner actually chooses.</span> This
    is, indeed, a standard way of taxing rent in most capitalist nations. It
    is possible because buyers and sellers trade land based on their careful
    estimates of its maximum rent-yielding capability. The tax valuer observes
    and records these value data, and uses them to place a value on all comparable
    lands. Many books and manuals and professional journals have been published
    on the techniques used: it is a well established art, with its own professional
    associations, of which our speaker Mr. Gwartney is a leading member. <br>
&nbsp; <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a tax is limited to the maximum possible
    rent, and so will not exceed a landowner's ability to pay - provided he uses
    the land in the most economical manner (which is not always the most intensive
    manner). It will surely not interfere with his using the land in the best
    way, but will discourage using it any other way. ...</span></small></p>
  <p>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you base a tax on taxable surplus,
    and keep the tax proportional to taxable surplus, you levy taxes without
    twisting and inverting the landowner's or land manager's ranking of land
    uses. </span>As noted before, the owner's preferred use after tax remains
    the same as it would be without any tax. On
the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">if you
tax on some other basis</span> (Gross Revenue, for example), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">you
bias the owner
against uses more heavily taxed.</span></span> To keep the example simple, and
generally
realistic, we assume here that the seller is a "price-taker," meaning he sells
on a world market and cannot raise the price, and so has no choice but to bear
the tax. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Bear in mind that Net Revenue is the Taxable Surplus: you cannot tax more than
that without aborting the land use. The ratio of Costs (C) to Gross Revenue (G)
varies over a wide range, from zero up nearly to one (and even above one for
subeconomic uses which, however, you do not want). Let's compare two rival uses,
A and B, for the same piece of land. Use "A" yields more Net Revenue (N), but
has a higher ratio of C/G. We levy a tax of 10% on Gross Revenue (G). To simplify,
Expenses and Capital Costs are consolidated as "C", so N = G-C. Table 1 shows
the effects of the tax on Net Revenue after Tax
(NAT).</p>

  <strong>The higher use, A, produces more goods, makes more jobs, and yields

<blockquote>
  <p>Another error made even by academic economists is to confuse the supply of
      land for a particular use, such as housing, with the overall supply of land.
      Of course the supply for a particular use can vary, since, for example, we
      can convert farmland to housing land. But the total area available for all
      uses does not change, and that is the relevant supply.</p>
  <p>The relevance for taxation is that if a plot of land used for a factory is
      taxed, the owner will not suddenly want to convert it into a farm unless its
      use as a factory was suboptimal. If the plot was already being used to maximize
      the rent, taxing it will not change the use. Taxing the site will also not
      make the boundary lines move to the west. Taxing the site will also not affect
      the demand by tenants to use the site. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined <strong>the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground
        is the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of
        that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon.</strong> Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>In his third five years the boom continues, and the community grows so fast
      that before the close of that period one corner of our friend's farm finds
      itself near the middle of a flourishing town. Five acres of it are needed for
      a public park, and five acres adjoining are wanted to cut up into building
      lots. As building lots, this part of the land will command a voluntary offer
      of a hundred dollars per year per acre of economic rent; and this fact establishes
      the land-value of the adjoining five acres needed for park purposes.</p>
  <p>In this situation what shall our farmer do?</p>
  <p>He has two courses open to him. If he doesn't want to relinquish his land,
      and can afford to withhold it from further improvement, he can pay the hundred
      dollars per acre per year of economic rent which these ten acres will now command,
      and keep his farm intact. If this appears to him too costly a luxury, he can
      signify his willingness to sell to the town the five acres wanted for the park,
      and the other five to individual builders. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font><br>
      Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself.</p>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p> But &#8212; and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
        of taxation &#8212; Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return
        from his land, must improve it. Unless he is satisfied with a small income
        from
        it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the community chooses
        to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best building the
        location will warrant. The rents of this building will be his in their
        entirety, not
        one dollar of them being taken from him by taxation. If he is not prepared
        or not willing to do this he would probably find it more profitable,
        before he leaves the country, to sell the land to some one of the many
        persons who
        are eager to build upon it. It will always be salable, although not by
        any means at present figures.</p>
  <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
      the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
      policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium is placed
      upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy penalty
      is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
      depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
      with the land.</p>
  <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put up
      a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin which
      now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and while paying
      a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby enabled
      to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
      is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
      amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
      and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
      letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
      till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it?</p>
  <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
      making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it from
      the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Concerns about urban policies also raise questions about the current relevance
      of Georgist ideas. For example, it is pertinent to ask whether a more uniform
      land tax would encourage the more efficient utilisation of urban space.
      George argued that, in order to cover the costs of a higher rate of land
      tax, landowners would be forced to put their land to its most productive
      use, and could not afford to hold it idle. Here is a clear link with the
      modern concerns to discourage &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and to promote &#8216;urban
      consolidation.&#8217; To the extent that a higher land tax would encourage
      the development of more housing in existing urban areas, the pressures
      for housing development in outlying areas would be significantly reduced.
      This, in turn, could reduce the burgeoning demand for transport that is
      currently characteristic of large cities.</p>
  <p>Land tax also impacts on the politics of peripheral urban expansion. Currently,
    the prospect of huge capital gains resulting from decisions by local governments
    to rezone land from rural to urban acts as an incentive for landowners on
    the fringes of built-up areas to lobby for changes that will allow increased
    development. Hence, landowners push for rights to subdivision, irrespective
    of whether or not there is actual demand (Day, 1995: 3). By creaming off
    the gains from windfall increases in land values, land tax obviates this
    bias towards relentless urban expansion.</p>
  <p>However, the question remains: would a uniform land tax be sufficient to
    produce more efficient patterns of urban development? Or would there still
    be a need for direct land use controls? Land tax can certainly be a tool
    for discouraging the wasteful use of land. It tends to discourage people
    from purchasing excessive amounts of land or leaving it idle. However, it
    may also encourage the overdevelopment of land in order to produce the income
    stream necessary to pay the higher rate of tax.</p>
  <p>Critics of urban consolidation such as Patrick Troy (1996) have examined
    the potential problems of such overdevelopment, including a range of environmental
    impacts such as altered hydrological processes. It seems to be an overly
    bold claim that a Georgist land tax alone would be sufficient to achieve
    optimal urban development patterns. Land use controls a necessary adjunct
    to land tax - in setting minimum requirements for green space, for example.</p>
  <p>Local government planning controls are also important to prevent incompatibility
    of land uses, such the development of hazardous or unhealthy industrial activities
    adjacent to residential areas. Targeted decentralisation policies are a means
    of encouraging the further development of regional centres. Such policies
    can work in conjunction with land taxes to ease growth pressures in the larger
    cities, while addressing long-standing spatial, social and economic inequalities
    (Stilwell, 2000: 254-260). The desirability of promoting more decentralised
    regional development is consistent with a Georgist perspective, but not altogether
    compatible with the claim that land tax would facilitate urban consolidation.
    It seems clear that it &#8216;overburdens&#8217; land tax to expect it alone
    to produce the best spatial outcomes, taking account of all the economic,
    social and environmental issues involved in urban and regional policy. The
    various other policy instruments &#8211; including regulations relating to
    green space, zoning, and the provision of public infrastructure to pave the
    way for decentralisation &#8211; are important complements to land taxation.
    In other words, land tax is best regarded as a necessary but not sufficient
    condition for more effective spatial policy. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
