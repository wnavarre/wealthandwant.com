      10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part

  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the
      whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. The needle
      of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
          the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
      the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All
      would be free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes,
      unannoyed
          by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
          more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the
          state would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty,
          as enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You
          shall not
          be fined for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before;
          you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
          lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
          out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
          reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
          reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
          one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
          bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
          it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
          his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
          to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
          are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
          fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
          field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
          a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
          a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
          direct profits.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
          him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his
          labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that
          labor and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all
          may share. And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed
          in a definite and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take
          while leaving to labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity
          of production this would commensurately increase.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the
          value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
          of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
          one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from
          use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

          Post's Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
        FAQ</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <em>Q6. If a land-owner builds, does not that increase the value
            of his land and consequently the amount of the tax he would have
            to pay? If so, would not he be taxed for his improvement?</em><br>
    A. No. Upon the value of the building he would never pay any tax. It is true
    that his improvement might attract others to the locality in such numbers
    as to make land there scarcer and consequently dearer. His own lot would
    in that case rise in value with the other land and be taxed more, just as
    the rest would be. But that would not take any of his labor in taxes; he
    would still have his building free of taxation. Thus: If on a lot worth $1000
    a building worth $1000 were erected, making the whole worth $2000, the tax
    would fall only upon the $1000 which represents the value of the lot. If
    land then became so scarce that the lot rose in value to $1500 the tax would
    be raised. But the owner's improvement would be still exempt. When his property
    was worth $2000 he was taxed on $1000, the value of the lot, leaving $1000,
    the value of the building, free; and now, though he is taxed on $1500, the
    value of the lot, $1000, the value of the building, is still free. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

          Capacity of Land </a>    </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
    also to uphold and fortify the tax
    base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
    people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
    skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
    Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
    it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b></small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its spillover effects were highly
    positive. What really depresses
    Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
    they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
    tax base.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
    floorspace rentals on ground rents
    and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
    land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
    cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
    inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
    will
    see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
    landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
    base.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
    much, the positive neighborhood
    effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
    contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
    true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
    without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
    new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
    off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
    into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
    base. </b>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

<p>  Fred Foldvary: <a
 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent:
  A Plea to Public Economists</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A site&#8217;s geo-rent is not based on the particular activity at that
        site. The geo-rent of a site containing lavish buildings and gardens
equals what the geo-rent would be if, for some strange reason, those improvements
    suddenly disintegrated. A fully developed site has about the same geo-rent
(per
    acre)
        as an adjacent vacant lot.<br>
        <br>
        Suppose I own a 50-acre site that is pristine, unimproved. That site would rent
        for $100,000. Hence, the geo-rent is $100,000. The next year I build a large
        beautiful and successful shopping center on the site. My geo-rent is still only
        $100,000 (assuming the amount for which my site unimproved would rent has not
        changed). However, if my shopping center makes neighboring land more valuable,
        it <span
 style="font-style: italic;">does </span>increase my neighbor&#8217;s
        geo-rent.<br>
        <br>
        The interrelation between one landowner&#8217;s improvements and his
        neighbor&#8217;s geo-rent is an interesting matter. Another interesting matter
        is a landowner&#8217;s contribution to improvements on neighboring lands,
        such as sponsoring a new road. If the new road would increase his geo-rent
        tax bill,
        geo-rent taxation, it would seem, would reduce his incentive to sponsor
        such an improvement.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> But here I leave
        these tangents aside, with the summary judgment that I do not think that such
        issues do much, if anything, to weaken the case for
        tapping geo-rent.<small>        </small>
  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1 The effect on geo-rent
          would be smaller if the road is a toll-road, because then more of the value
          added is internalized, i.e., captured by the road owners.</font></small> ...
