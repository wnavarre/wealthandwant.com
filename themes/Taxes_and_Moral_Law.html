  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes
    and Moral Law</span>    </div>
  <p>What passes for conversations about &quot;tax reform&quot; usually is a matter of
    discussing what the tax brackets and tax rates should be for the federal
    or state income
    tax. But income taxes are neither moral nor otherwise desirable: their perverse
    incentives are exceeded only by their immoral quality &#8212; they take from
    the individual that which he labors to create.</p>
  <p>But taxes on land value are fundamentally different. None of us created land,
    nor can we trace our title in land to the one who created it. All of us were
    created equal, and should share equally in the value of our common assets,
    which includes the economic value of America's land. Land's value comes from
    the presence of each one of us, from naturally provided amenities, from increases
    of population, and from the economic activity of the society as a whole. Why
    on earth should its value be subject to privatization? (&quot;Tradition&quot; is no better
    an answer to this question than it was to the question of whether chattel slavery
    was or is just in a society devoted to the proposition that all of us are created
    equal.!)</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, unlike any other kind of taxation, takes from individuals
    only that which SOCIETY, NATURE and OUR FELLOWS have created, not what he himself
    created. So it is supremely moral, unlike taxes on wages, sales and buildings.
    Even better, the incentives it creates are consistent with the common good,
    with widely shared prosperity, with abolishing poverty.</p>
  <p>That's the intersection of taxes and moral law.</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of
Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br />
        2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what
        the particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may
        be had by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage
        and for which no rent is paid; and,<br />
        3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
        in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
        social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
        withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality?... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
    <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
      progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent
      be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps
      in the direction of realizing through orderly and natural growth those
      grand conceptions of both the socialist and the individualist, which in
      the present condition of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not
      likewise a plain warning that if Rent be treated as private property, advances
      in productive power will be steps in the direction of making slaves of
      the many laborers, and masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that
      common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural law, and that its private
      appropriation is disorderly and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the
      tendency illustrated in the preceding chart are considered in connection
      with the self-evident truth that God made the earth for common use and
      not for private monopoly, how can a contrary inference hold? Caused and
      increased by social growth, 97 the benefits of which should be common,
      and attaching to land, the just right to which is equal, Rent must be the
      natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
          settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues,
          and none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes,
          and another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
          Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little;
          perhaps just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village
          becomes a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher.
          It becomes a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so
          are the land values.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
          with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline
          of society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as
          distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand,
          measure the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from
          that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the parts into which
          Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed
          it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish

          can there be any question as to the fund from which society should

    <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and

      of the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and
      that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual
      in proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether
      we trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in
      the eighth commandment. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A possible difficulty with classical liberalism as a justification for
      government action is that it may justify little if any government action.
      Taxes intrude
        upon individual liberty. How is this intrusion to be justified? One way
      to try to get around this difficulty is by the claim that some expenditures
        on protecting individual rights are so valuable that anyone would understand
        that, for these expenditures, the reduction in individual liberty from
      taxation
        is less than the addition to individual liberty from the protection of
      individual rights that is possible with taxation. However, if improving
      the well-being
        of all citizens is the justification, then one should ask whether there
      is adequate justification for even these government actions if they do
      not have
      unanimous support. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of
      Taxation: The Local Case</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is a gentler side of taxation that provides some explanation of
      our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that people achieve
      their
        common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so that there will be money
        to pay for public services that they want. From this perspective, taxation
        may be considered no more than the dues for belonging to a club that
      provides people with things that they would rather pay their share of than
      do without.
        However, to
    make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people must be able
    to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to be a citizen of the
    taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by some taxing jurisdiction, the
    choice isn't
    exactly free.</p>
    <p>The problem of morality in taxation is the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do we retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions
            to the cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
            the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
        of plunder? </li>
      <li>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly impose on our
        fellow citizens? </li>
      <li>And how do we set up a structure of government that will ensure that
            these limits are observed? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The turn-of-the-century Swedish economist, Knut Wicksell, had ideas that
      dealt with some of these questions (Wicksell, 1958 [1896]). Wicksell argued
      that
      if a public expenditure is worthwhile, then there must be some allocation
      among citizens of the taxes that are needed to finance the expenditure
      that would
      make everyone better off. If legislatures were required to achieve unanimity
      to pass spending programs, then they would have to find allocations of
      taxes that were unanimously acceptable before they could pass those programs.
      In
      that case, majorities would have no opportunity to exploit minorities,
      and inefficient proposals would be prevented from passing as well. Wicksell
      recognized
      that if complete unanimity were required, strategic holdouts would be likely
      to prevent any program from passing, so he was content to recommend a rule
      of "near-unanimity," without being specific about what this meant. </p>
    <p>While Wicksell's insights are interesting, they do not fully solve the problem
      of moral taxation, because any departure from unanimity opens the door to exploitation
      of minorities, and the requirement of more-than-majority approval means that
      the costs of coalition-building will leave some worthwhile activities unapproved.
      Still, we would probably have a much more efficient public sector if every
      public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative bodies.</p>
    <p>But to make taxation truly voluntary, the option to leave must be viable.
      If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to another, taking all
      of their belongings with them, then competition among jurisdictions would tend
      to eliminate oppressive taxation. This would leave only the fees that people
      were prepared to pay to have public services (Tiebout, 1956). ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">read

Weld Carter: <a

Introduction to Henry George</a><br>
</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Taxation </b><br>
  It was but a short step from the ethics of property to the ethics of taxation.
      George's position here was that as labor and capital rightfully and unconditionally
      own what they produce, no one can rightfully appropriate any of their earnings;
      nor can the State. On the other hand, land value is always a socially created
      value, never the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this
      is a value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
      the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs. Furthermore,
      to charge the owner for this value, in the form of taxation, is only to
      collect from him the precise value of the benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on products,
      George spoke of "...all taxes now levied on the products and processes
      of industry -- which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor,
      we hold to be infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of the
        justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith speaks of incomes
        as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and this is the ground
        upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
        insisted upon -- that it is equally protected by the state. The basis
        of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible
        by the state -- that there is a value created and maintained by the community,
        which is justly called upon to meet community expenses. Now of what values
        is this true? Only of the value of land. This is a value that does not
        arise until a community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows
        with the growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists.
        Scatter again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would
        have no value at all. With every increase of population the value of
        land rises; with every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is, therefore,
      the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive
      from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion
      to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the
      use of the community, that value which is the creation of the community.
      It is the application the common property to common uses."&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span
