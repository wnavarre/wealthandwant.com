<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ricardo
believed that ground rents and
the value of land have a tendency to rise continuously and that this
benefits solely the landowners. The progress of industrialization and
urbanization in the second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid
increase in the value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped
tremendous profits. </span>This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that
"Only the landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without
working, risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land
in order to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land
owners.</small><br>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent becomes critically
important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the
differential
return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
location. And that can be priced and collected easily.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Despite assiduous efforts to make clear the extent and the
limits of
the economic rent as a concept &#8212; known as well as land rent, Ricardian
rent, and ground rent, even the best of contemporary neoclassical
economists disagree. Some texts argue that certain athletes or other
star performers with great natural ability reap returns for their
efforts far above what is in fact necessary to &#8220;bring them into
productive use.&#8221; The difference between what it would minimally take to
entice them to perform and the price they are actually paid is all
economic rent. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears, and the
Beatles have all been compensated with impressive amounts of economic
rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Georgists and classical economists are of mixed minds, arguing
sometimes that such payments are either wages or else are simply
transfers that in no way reflect productivity.<small><span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How the Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
classical economic thought still regarded land for the most part as the
common heritage of mankind. From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus,
David Ricardo, and finally with John Stuart Mill economic productivity
was regarded as a function of three interacting factors: land, labor,
and capital. John Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve
optimal economic productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price
from each of those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price
of capital was interest; and the price of land, particularly following
the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. Rent in its classical sense
means payment for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more
generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted if
the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we shall
see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not seeing
any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent economics
profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to regard land as a
separate factor and to redefine the terms of production instead in
two-factor theory. This was concurrent with the inclusion of land as
property, since called "real property."</small><br>
<br>
<small>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped
under title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be
regarded as a private financial asset. Earlier it was regarded as part
of nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting practices
now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a liability
on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to banks. This
tendency has been extended today so that we have privatized much of our
air, water, wind, and even sunlight. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
came to be simply one special kind of capital, nothing special, nothing
requiring further treatment. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an artifact
of intellectual history. The conflation of land into capital to create
two-factor economics is one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the
evolution of social philosophy.</span> How the premises and terms of
economic discourse have been changed has been documented for the first
time in a new book by a California professor of economics, Mason
Gaffney. The account is put forth in fascinating detail entitled, The
Corruption of Economics. It was indeed a corruption of a discipline, a
deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an interest in
seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been paying the price
since that time. This revealing thesis is what I really want to relate
to you, and to explain the dire consequences it has had for us in our
contemporary world. I have come to believe it; it makes sense to me,
both historically and in contemporary analysis, from several
perspectives.&nbsp; ... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html"><span
