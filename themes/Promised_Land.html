<br>
a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small style="font-weight: bold;">The
    Promised Land and the Kingdom of God</small><br>
  <small>The Promised Land, like Eden, is a place of unhindered scope in
    which to glorify God and manifest his will. But it is not the Kingdom
    of God. It represents liberation from external bondage -- from
    oppression and restricted access to material opportunity. It is the
    temporal matrix within which the Kingdom may find full expression. But
    it is not itself the Kingdom. Although it is a heresy that locates this
    Kingdom exclusively in the afterlife or an ethereal paradise, Jesus
    declared it to be "not of this world" (John 18:36) but "within" (Luke
    17:21). <strong>It is no reproach to Henry George that he lost sight of this
    distinction between the Promised Land and the Kingdom of God,
  enraptured by his vision of a just society:</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><em>With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with
    the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of jealousy
    and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
    loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure; and
    who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? Words
    fail the thought! It is the Golden Age.... It is the culmination of
    Christianity -- the City of God on earth, with walls of jasper and
  gates of pearl! It is the reign of the Prince of Peace!</em></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>By equalizing opportunity, political and economic liberation
    tend to draw both poor and rich into the middle class. As an expression
    of social justice, this constitutes a genuine advance, ethical as well
    as material. But it is no easy guarantee of spiritual gain.
    Middle-class traits include virtues such as industry, thrift,
    restraint, commercial and professional rectitude, but, on the other
    hand, low prudentialism, self-satisfaction, and an inclination to
    regard material well-being as a sign of righteousness. Hence, even in
    the Promised Land, what Paulo Freire calls "conscientization" (roughly,
    consciousness-raising through social commitment), emphasized and
    refined by liberation theology, must continue although in a different
    vein. The Kingdom of God will flourish only when outward liberation
    gives rise to inward liberation, a victory over the limitations of the
  bourgeois ethos.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"The Earth Is the Lord's" (Psalm 24:1). This statement tells us
    something about God. He is attached to the land and loves it. He is not
    a spiritual abstraction oblivious to the Wasteland in which we live.
    God is the maker of the world of eating and sleeping, working and
    begetting. It also tells us something of our place in this world. With
    God as the true owner of the earth, every person has a right to the
  produce which equitable usufruct yields to his or her efforts.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
    same God who established communities has also in his providence
    ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
    Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
    the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
    extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
    were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
    taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
    individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
    produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
    the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
    the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
    justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
  Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
    have a corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a
    well-nigh universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more
    sinful than are people at large, except to the degree that they
    knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation.
    Many abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system,
  it is better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
    does. The profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially
    desirable as well as in ways that are socially destructive. Let us give
    testimony to our faith that the earth is the Lord's by building a
  social order in which there are no victims. <a
