    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
        Increasing Importance of Social Questions </a>(Chapter 1 of <em><a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
        Problems</a></em>, 1883)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[03] Between the development of society and the development of species
        there is a close analogy. In the lowest forms of animal life there is
        little difference of parts; both wants and powers are few and simple;
        movement seems automatic; and instincts are scarcely distinguishable
        from those of the vegetable. So homogeneous are some of these living
        things, that if cut in pieces, each piece still lives. But as life rises
        into higher manifestations, simplicity gives way to complexity, the parts
        develop into organs having separate functions and reciprocal relations,
        new wants and powers arise, and a greater and greater degree of intelligence
        is needed to secure food and avoid danger. Did fish, bird or beast possess
        no higher intelligence than the polyp, nature could bring them forth
        only to die.</p>
      <p>[04] This law &#8212; that the increasing complexity and delicacy of
        organization which give higher capacity and increased power are accompanied
        by increased wants and dangers, and require, therefore, increased intelligence &#8212; runs
        through nature. In the ascending scale of life at last comes man, the
        most highly and delicately organized of animals. Yet not only do his
        higher powers require for their use a higher intelligence than exists
        in other animals, but without higher intelligence he could not live.
        His skin is too thin; his nails too brittle; he is too poorly adapted
        for running, climbing, swimming or burrowing. Were he not gifted with
        intelligence greater than that of any beast, he would perish from cold,
        starve from inability to get food, or be exterminated by animals better
        equipped for the struggle in which brute instinct suffices.</p>
      <p>[05] In man, however, the intelligence which increases all through nature's
        rising scale passes at one bound into an intelligence so superior, that
        the difference seems of kind rather than degree. In him, that narrow
        and seemingly unconscious intelligence that we call instinct becomes
        conscious reason, and the godlike power of adaptation and invention makes
        feeble man nature's king.</p>
      <p>[06] But with man the ascending line stops. Animal life assumes no higher
        form; nor can we affirm that, in all his generations, man, as an animal,
        has a whit improved. But progression in another line begins. Where the
        development of species ends, social development commences, and that advance
        of society that we call civilization so increases human powers, that
        between savage and civilized man there is a gulf so vast as to suggest
        the gulf between the highly organized animal and the oyster glued to
        the rocks. And with every advance upon this line new vistas open. When
        we try to think what knowledge and power progressive civilization may
        give to the men of the future, imagination fails.</p>
      <p>[07] In this progression which begins with man, as in that which leads
        up to him, the same law holds. Each advance makes a demand for higher
        and higher intelligence. With the beginnings of society arises the need
        for social intelligence &#8212; for that consensus of individual intelligence
        which forms a public opinion, a public conscience, a public will, and
        is manifested in law, institutions and administration. As society develops,
        a higher and higher degree of this social intelligence is required, for
        the relation of individuals to each other becomes more intimate and important,
        and the increasing complexity of the social organization brings liability
        to new dangers.</p>
      <p>[08] In the rude beginning, each family produces its own food, makes
        its own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves, furnishes
        its own transportation. Compare with this independence the intricate
        interdependence of the denizens of a modern city. They may supply themselves
        with greater certainty, and in much greater variety and abundance, than
        the savage; but it is by the cooperation of thousands. Even the water
        they drink, and the artificial light they use, are brought to them by
        elaborate machinery, requiring the constant labor and watchfulness of
        many men. They may travel at a speed incredible to the savage; but in
        doing so resign life and limb to the care of others. A broken rail, a
        drunken engineer, a careless switchman, may hurl them to eternity. And
        the power of applying labor to the satisfaction of desire passes, in
        the same way, beyond the direct control of the individual. The laborer
        becomes but part of a great machine, which may at any time be paralyzed
        by causes beyond his power, or even his foresight. Thus does the well-being
        of each become more and more dependent upon the well-being of all &#8212; the
        individual more and more subordinate to society.</p>
      <p>[12] Nor should we forget that in civilized man still lurks the savage.
        The men who, in past times, oppressed or revolted, who fought to the
        death in petty quarrels and drunk fury with blood, who burned cities
        and rent empires, were men essentially such as those we daily meet. Social
        progress has accumulated knowledge, softened manners, refined tastes
        and extended sympathies, but man is yet capable of as blind a rage as
        when, clothed in skins, he fought wild beasts with a flint. And present
        tendencies, in some respects at least, threaten to kindle passions that
        have so often before flamed in destructive fury.</p>
      <p>[13] There is in all the past nothing to compare with the rapid changes
        now going on in the civilized world. It seems as though in the European
        race, and in the nineteenth century, man was just beginning to live &#8212; just
        grasping his tools and becoming conscious of his powers. The snail's
        pace of crawling ages has suddenly become the headlong rush of the locomotive,
        speeding faster and faster. This rapid progress is primarily in industrial
        methods and material powers. But industrial changes imply social changes
        and necessitate political changes. Progressive societies outgrow institutions
        as children outgrow clothes. Social progress always requires greater
        intelligence in the management of public affairs; but this the more as
        progress is rapid and change quicker.</p>
      <p>[14] And that the rapid changes now going on are bringing up problems
        that demand most earnest attention may be seen on every hand. Symptoms
        of danger, premonitions of violence, are appearing all over the civilized
        world. Creeds are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces of conservatism
        are melting away. Political institutions are failing, as clearly in democratic
        America as in monarchical Europe. There is growing unrest and bitterness
        among the masses, whatever be the form of government, a blind groping
        for escape from conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute all this
        to the teachings of demagogues is like attributing the fever to the quickened
        pulse. It is the new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles. To put
        into a sailing-ship the powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer
        would be to tear her to pieces with their play. So the new powers rapidly
        changing all the relations of society must shatter social and political
        organizations not adapted to meet their strain.</p>
      <p>[15] To adjust our institutions to growing needs and changing conditions
        is the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism, human sympathy,
        and religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake it. There is
        danger in reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism.
        The problems beginning to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that
        there is fear they may not be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes.
        But their gravity comes from indisposition to recognize frankly and grapple
        boldly with them.</p>
      <p>[16] These dangers, which menace not one country alone, but modern civilization
        itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling to be born &#8212; that
        the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown conditions and institutions
        that before sufficed.</p>
      <p>[17] A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the
        hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines,
        must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization
        is possible in which the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences
        now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless,
        and charitable societies unthought of. Such a civilization waits only
        for the social intelligence that will adapt means to ends. Powers that
        might give plenty to all are already in our hands. Though there is poverty
        and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of
        wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say manufacturers, &quot;and
        we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give us but work!&quot; cry
        idle men.</p>
      <p>[18] The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
        of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
        of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science
        strides forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in
        the arts which produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its
        equitable distribution. Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and
        commerce have been revolutionized; but whether free trade or protection
        is best for a nation we are not yet agreed. We have brought machinery
        to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years ago, could not have been imagined;
        but, in the presence of political corruption, we seem as helpless as
        idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph of mechanical skill;
        but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had to carry to New
        York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New York aldermen.
        The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned in a crazed
        and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only by peering
        through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass is
        estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer
        could not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable.</p>
      <p>[19] The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
        be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few,
        but that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians,
        or political economy to college professors. The people themselves must
        think, because the people alone can act.</p>
      <p>[20] In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
        the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
        This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
        having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But
        the salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of
        humanity, is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ.
        Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business
        of each; it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which
        none can escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares
        for his family, yet takes no interest in the general weal, and gives
        no thought to those who are trodden under foot, save now and then to
        bestow aims, is not a true Christian. Nor is he a good citizen. The duty
        of the citizen is more and harder than this.</p>
      <p>[21] The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is
        not a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious
        sentiment and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch
        out beyond self-interest, whether it be the self-interest of the few
        or of the many. It must seek justice. For at the bottom of every social
        problem we will find a social wrong. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">..

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>  b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
    assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more productive.93
    Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition that social
    growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure of labor force
    as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied to the second, to
    50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as
    applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for
    land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon the
        distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways: First, By
        lowering the margin
      of cultivation.
        Second, By bringing out in land special capabilities otherwise latent,
      and by attaching special capabilities to particular lands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode, to which little attention
        has been given by political economists, is really the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks off land from those material
        things which we regard as products of the land, we shall find that the fundamental
        attribute of land is its extension. The right to use a piece of land gives
        command over a certain space &#8212; a certain part of the earth's surface.
        The area of the earth is fixed; the geometric relations in which any
        particular part of it stands to other parts are fixed. Man has no control
        over them;
        they are wholly unaffected by demand; they have no cost of production;
        there is no supply price at which they can be produced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface is a primary condition
        of anything that man can do; it gives him room for his own actions, with
        the enjoyment of the heat and the light, the air and the rain which nature
        assigns to that area; and it determines his distance from, and in great measure
        his relations to, other things and other persons. We shall find that it is
        this property of land, which, though as yet insufficient prominence has been
        given to it, is the ultimate cause of the distinction which all writers are
        compelled to make between land and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book iv, ch. ii, sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this regular way; the charts
        are merely illustrative. They are intended to illustrate the universal fact
        that as any land becomes a center of trade or other social relationship its
        value rises.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
    But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of labor
    increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages (as a proportion
    of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward, while that of Rent
    is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by observation. 96</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader, before closing this
        chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that I am using the word
        wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in the sense of a proportion. When
        I say that wages fall as rent rises, I do not mean that the quantity of wealth
        obtained by laborers as wages is necessarily less, but that the proportion
        which it bears to the whole produce is necessarily less. The proportion may
        diminish while the quantity remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would
        be the result of social growth if all land but that which was in full
        use were common land. The discovery
        of mines, the development of cities and towns, and the construction of
        railroads, the irrigation of and places, improvements in government,
        all the infinite
        conveniences and laborsaving devices that civilization generates, would
        tend to abolish poverty by increasing the compensation of labor, and
        making it
        impossible for any man to be in involuntary idleness, or underpaid, so
        long as mankind was in want. If demand for land increased, Wages would
        tend to
        fall as the demand brought lower grades of land into use; but they would
        at the same time tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities
        to the lower grades. And it is altogether probable that, while progress
        would
        lower Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase them
        as an absolute quantity.</font> <font size="+1"><strong>...

  <p><em>Q32. Is not ownership of land necessary to induce its improvement? Does
      not history show that private ownership is a step in advance of common
      ownership?</em><br>
A. No. Private use was doubtless a step in advance of common use. And because
private use seems to us to have been brought about under the institution of private
ownership, private ownership appears to the superficial to have been the real
advance. But a little observation and reflection will remove that impression.
Private ownership of land is not necessary to its private use. And so far from
inducing improvement, private ownership retards it. When a man owns land he may
accumulate wealth by doing nothing with the land, simply allowing the community
to increase its value while he pays a merely nominal tax, upon the plea that
he gets no income from the property. But when the possessor has to pay the value
of his land every year, as he would have to under the single tax, and as ground
renters do now, he must improve his holding in order to profit by it. Private
possession of land, without profit except from use, promotes improvement; private
ownership, with profit regardless of use, retards improvement. Every city in
the world, in its vacant lots, offers proof of the statement. It is the lots
that are owned, and not those that are held upon ground-lease, that remain vacant.

    excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> FIVE centuries ago the wealth-producing power of England, man for man,
    was small indeed compared with what it is now. Not merely were all the great
    inventions and discoveries which since the Introduction of steam have revolutionized
    mechanical industry then undreamed of, but even agriculture was far ruder
    and less productive. Artificial grasses had not been discovered. The potato,
    the carrot, the turnip, the beet, and many other plants and vegetables which
    the farmer now finds most prolific, had not been introduced. The advantages
    which ensue from rotation of crops were unknown. Agricultural implements
    consisted of the spade, the sickle, the flail, the rude plow and the harrow.
    Cattle had not been bred to more than one-half the size they average now,
    and sheep did not yield half the fleece. Roads, where there were roads, were
    extremely bad, wheel vehicles scarce and rude, and places a hundred miles
    from each other were, in difficulties of transportation, practically as far
    apart as London and Hong Kong, or San Francisco and New York, are now.</p>
  <p>Yet patient students of those times tell us that the condition of the English
    laborer was not only relatively, but absolutely better in those rude times
    than it is in England today, after five centuries of advance in the productive
    arts. They tell us that the workingman did not work so hard as he does now,
    and lived better; that he was exempt from the harassing dread of being forced
    by loss of employment to want and beggary, or of leaving a family that must
    apply to charity to avoid I starvation. Pauperism as it prevails in the rich
    England of the nineteenth century was in the far poorer England of the fourteenth
    century absolutely unknown. Medicine was empirical and superstitious, sanitary
    regulations and precautions were all but unknown. There were frequently plague
    and occasionally famine, for, owing to the difficulties of transportation,
    the scarcity of one district could not &quot;be relieved by the plenty of
    another. But men did not as they do now, starve in the midst of abundance;
    and what is perhaps the most significant fact of all is that not only were
    women and children not worked as they are today, but the eight-hour system,
    which even the working classes of the United States, with all the profusion
    of labor-saving machinery and appliances have not yet attained, was then
    the common system! &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade &#8212; Chapter 22:
    The Real Weakness of Free Trade.</em></p>
  <p> MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend to advance in proportion
    to the mental power expended in progression &#8212; the mental power which
    is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</p>
  <p>To compare society to a boat. Her progress through the water will not depend
    upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted to propelling
    her. This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for baling,
    or any expenditure of force in fighting among themselves or in pulling in
    different directions.</p>
  <p>Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
    existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
    of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
    which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the
    first essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together
    in peaceful association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater
    the possibilities of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental
    power in conflict becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords
    to each an equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
    is the second essential of progress.</p>
  <p>Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees mental
    power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
    the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law)
    prevents the dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</p>
  <p><br>
    I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that honored,
      not with the lips but with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would
      have occasion to worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies
      of the field. There is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this
      mad struggle, we trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency
      for us all; trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other. &#8212; The
      Crime of Poverty</p>
  <p>WHOSE fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make
    that terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and the
    necessity of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that
    it is the fault of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring
    cholera to this country, or the man who, having the power to prevent its
    coming here, would make no effort to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty
    is worse than cholera; poverty kills more people than pestilence, even in
    the best of times. Look at the death statistics of our cities; see where
    the deaths come quickest; see where it is that the little children die like
    flies &#8212; it is in the poorer quarters. And the man who looks with careless
    eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence; the man who does not set himself
    to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty of a crime. &#8212; The Crime
    of Poverty</p>
  <p>SOCIAL progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business of
    each; it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can
    escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family,
    yet takes no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those
    who are trodden underfoot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true
    Christian. Nor is he a good citizen. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter
    1, the Increasing Importance of Social Questions</p>
  <p>WE cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political economy to
    college professors. The people themselves must think, because the people
    alone can act. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter 1, the Increasing
    Importance of Social Questions</p>
  <p>I AM convinced that we make a great mistake in depriving one sex of voice
    in public matters, and that we could in no way so increase the attention,
    the intelligence and the devotion which may be brought to the solution of
    social problems as by enfranchising our women. Even if in a ruder state of
    society the intelligence of one sex suffices for the management of common
    interests, the vastly more intricate, more delicate and more important questions
    which the progress of civilization makes of public moment, require the intelligence
    of women as of men, and that we never can obtain until we interest them in
    public affairs. And I have come to believe that very much of the inattention,
    the flippancy, the want of conscience, which we see manifested in regard
    to public matters of the greatest moment, arises from the fact that we debar
    our women from taking their proper part in these matters. Nothing will fully
    interest men unless it also interests women. There are those who say that
    women are less intelligent than men; but who will say that they are less
    influential? &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter 22: Conclusion</p>
