  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse. </p>
    <p>For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must draw
        for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for the
        supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
        the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
        the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,
        to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
        of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
        to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
        rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
        wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
        go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
        those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land
        and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among
        all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
        of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>a. Explanation of Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Differences in the desirableness of land divide Wealth into the two funds,
    Wages and Rent. Labor naturally applies its forces to that land from which,
    considering all the existing and known circumstances, most Wealth can be
    produced with least expenditure of labor force. Such land is the best. So
    long as the best land exceeds demand for it, laborers are upon an equality
    of opportunity, and the entire product goes to them as Wages in proportion
    to the labor force they respectively expend. But when the supply of the best
    land falls below demand for it, some laborers must resort to land where with
    an equal expenditure of labor force they produce less wealth than those who
    use the best land. The laborers thus excluded from the best land naturally
    offer a premium for it, or what is the same thing, offer to work for its
    owners for what they might obtain by working for themselves upon the poorer
    land. This condition differentiates Rent from Wages. <strong>Rent goes to
    land-owners as such, irrespective of whether they labor or not; Wages go
    to laborers
    as such, irrespective of whether they own land or not.</strong>85</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">85. Land of every kind may vary in desirableness from other land of the
        same kind. Certain farming land, for example, is so fertile that it will
        yield to a given application of labor two bushels of wheat to every bushel
        that certain other farming land will yield; and it is obvious that, other
        things being equal, farmers would prefer the more fertile land. But some
        fertile land lies so far away from market that less fertile land lying nearer
        is more productive, because it costs less to exchange its products for what
        their producer demands; in such cases farmers would prefer the less fertile
        land. The same principle applies to all kinds of land. Building lots at or
        near a center of residence or business are preferable for most purposes of
        residence or business to lots equally good in other respects which are far
        away.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now, the land that is preferable is of course most in demand; and if it
        be all in use, with demand for it unsatisfied, competition for the preference
        sets in, and gives value to it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">All land cannot be equally desirable. Some excels in fertility. Some is
        rich with mineral deposits, a species of fertility. On some, towns and cities
        settle, thereby adding to the productiveness of the labor that uses it, because
        these sites are thus made centers of co-operation or trade. And yet production
        in the civilized state requires that the producer shall have exclusive possession
        of the land lie needs. This necessity inevitably gives to some people more
        desirable land than others have, even though all should have an abundance.
        Consequently the returns to equal labor are unequal. The man who has land
        that is more fertile or better located than that of another gets more wealth
        than the other in return for a given expenditure of labor. If, for example,
        one with given labor produces 10 bushels of corn from fertile land, equal,
        say, to $5 worth of any kind of wealth in the market, and the other with
        the same labor produces 8 bushels of corn, or $4 worth of any kind of wealth
        in the market, the first receives 2 bushels (or $1) more for his labor than
        the other receives for his, though each labors with equal effort, skill,
        and intelligence. Or, if the fertility of the land be the same, but its situation
        in reference to the market be such that the cost of transportation still
        preserves the relation of $5 to $4, the same inequality of wages results.
        It is this phenomenon that gives rise to Rent. Rent is the market value of
        just such differences in opportunity as are here illustrated. It is a premium
        for choice land, for preferential locations, for site, for space.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">This premium is a very different thing from compensation for labor. Nor
        is the difference modified when premium owners first obtain Wages for work
        and with them buy the premium-commanding land. Rent can no more be turned
        into compensation for labor by exchanging labor products for the power to
        exact it, than a man can be turned into Wealth by exchanging Wealth for him.
        Whether the fruits of purchase or of conquest, or of fraud, Rent always constitutes
        that part of Wealth which is deducted from current production as premiums
        for superior opportunities for production.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Wages and Rent are both drawn from Wealth, and both go often to the same
        individual and in the same form of payment, as when a freehold farmer enjoys
        the use of the grain he raises from more fertile land than his neighbors
        have, or a city freeholder occupies or receives hire from his house and lot:
        but Wages flow from Wealth to labor as compensation for production, while
        Rent flows from Wealth to land-owners in premiums for allowing labor to produce
        Wealth from superior locations. Wages are appurtenant to Labor; Rent is appurtenant
        to Land. It is as laborer that the individual takes Wages, but as land-owner
        that he takes Rent.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
    assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more productive.93
    Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition that social
    growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure of labor force
    as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied to the second, to
    50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as
    applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for
    land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon the
        distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways: First, By
        lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing out in land special
        capabilities otherwise latent, and by attaching special capabilities
        to particular lands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode, to
        which little attention has been given by political economists, is really
        the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch.
        iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks off
        land from those material things which we regard as products of the land,
        we shall find that the fundamental attribute of land is its extension.
        The right to use a piece of land gives command over a certain space &#8212; a
        certain part of the earth's surface. The area of the earth is fixed;
        the geometric relations in which any particular part of it stands to
        other parts are fixed. Man has no control over them; they are wholly
        unaffected by demand; they have no cost of production; there is no supply
        price at which they can be produced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface
        is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it gives him room
        for his own actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the light, the
        air and the rain which nature assigns to that area; and it determines
        his distance from, and in great measure his relations to, other things
        and other persons. We shall find that it is this property of land, which,
        though as yet insufficient prominence has been given to it, is the ultimate
        cause of the distinction which all writers are compelled to make between
        land and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book iv, ch. ii,
        sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this regular
        way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are intended to illustrate
        the universal fact that as any land becomes a center of trade or other
        social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
    But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of labor
    increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages (as a proportion
    of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward, while that of Rent
    is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by observation. 96</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader,
        before closing this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that
        I am using the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in the
        sense of a proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises, I do
        not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers as wages is
        necessarily less, but that the proportion which it bears to the whole
        produce is necessarily less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity
        remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book
        iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would
        be the result of social growth if all land but that which was in full
        use were common land. The discovery of mines, the development of cities
        and towns, and the construction of railroads, the irrigation of and places,
        improvements in government, all the infinite conveniences and laborsaving
        devices that civilization generates, would tend to abolish poverty by
        increasing the compensation of labor, and making it impossible for any
        man to be in involuntary idleness, or underpaid, so long as mankind was
        in want. If demand for land increased, Wages would tend to fall as the
        demand brought lower grades of land into use; but they would at the same
        time tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower
        grades. And it is altogether probable that, while progress would lower
        Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase them as an
        absolute quantity.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler. Getting no
        benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and none of the land
        about him has any value. Another settler comes, and another, until a village
        appears. Some public revenue is then required. Not much, but some. And the
        land has a little value, only a little; perhaps just enough to equal the
        need for public revenue. The village becomes a town. More revenues are needed,
        and land values are higher. It becomes a city. The public revenues required
        are enormous, and so are the land values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with the rise, advancing
        with the growth, and receding with the decline of society, it measures the
        earning power of society as a whole as distinguished from that of the individuals.
        Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning power of the individuals as
        distinguished from that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the
        parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be
        correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and
        to distinguish the two kinds as Communal Earnings and Individual Earnings.
        How, then, can there be any question as to the fund from which society should
        be supported? How can it be justly supported in any other way than out of
        its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>
  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>

  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212;<a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm"> Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two

  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    <em>Q6. If a land-owner builds, does not that increase the value of his land
      and consequently the amount of the tax he would have to pay? If so, would
      not he be taxed for his improvement?</em><br>
    A. No. Upon the value of the building he would never pay any tax. It is true
    that his improvement might attract others to the locality in such numbers
    as to make land there scarcer and consequently dearer. His own lot would
    in that case rise in value with the other land and be taxed more, just as
    the rest would be. But that would not take any of his labor in taxes; he
    would still have his building free of taxation. Thus: If on a lot worth $1000
    a building worth $1000 were erected, making the whole worth $2000, the tax
    would fall only upon the $1000 which represents the value of the lot. If
    land then became so scarce that the lot rose in value to $1500 the tax would
    be raised. But the owner's improvement would be still exempt. When his property
    was worth $2000 he was taxed on $1000, the value of the lot, leaving $1000,
    the value of the building, free; and now, though he is taxed on $1500, the
    value of the lot, $1000, the value of the building, is still free. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
