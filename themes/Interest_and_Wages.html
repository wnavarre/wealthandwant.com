and Wages</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>The three factors that contribute to production &#8212; land, labor and
    capital &#8212; each receive a return. Land earns rent, labor earns wages,
    capital earns
    interest. Land is, by its nature, fixed in supply: when demand for land rises,
    no more land can be created, so land price rises. When land gets a higher
    return, labor and capital by definition get a lower return. Labor is supplied
    by human
    beings, day by day. Capital is supplied by human beings, from their savings.
    Why should the owners of land &#8212; who didn't produce even a square foot
    of it &#8212;  collect more rent simply because land is fixed in supply,
    depriving labor
    and capital of their just return?</p>
  <p>Labor cannot wait as long as capital can. Capital is often patient money &#8212;    but
    everyone needs to eat every day, and needs shelter every day. So people will
    accept lower wages, if they must, in order to eat. Those without any
    savings have no option. When we make snips in our social safety net, the
    result is
    to force people to accept low wages, even if they are not sufficient to meet
    their most simply defined needs.</p>
  <p>When the rent on land is mostly left in the pockets of the landholders,
    they get rich in their sleep, and they need not put good land to good use.
    When
    we fail to collect the rent as our common entitlement, we have to tax wages
    and interest to fund our common spending. And what is the effect of our common
    spending? It makes land more valuable! So the landholders can charge those
    who need good sites a higher rent. What a privilege for the landholders.
    What an injustice for anyone who needs land &#8212; all of us!</p>
  <p>We may each wear three hats: as workers (labor), as landholders (land) and
    as capitalists (capital). To the extent that we permit our laws and our system
    of taxation to favor the holders of land, we disadvantage those who work
    and those who save and invest in wealth-producing goods (capital). While
    2/3 of us consider ourselves homeowners (whether or not we own our homes
    outright), we may think that structures which favor the holders or land work
    to our personal benefit, even if society as a whole is disadvantaged. But
    the fact is that most of the benefit goes to those who own our most valuable
    land, which can be 100,000 times as valuable, per acre, as good agricultural
    land. Thus, our interests as workers and as savers are not served when we
    allow privilege to landholders. </p>
  <p>Money that must be spent to acquire land is not available for capital or
    labor, and, equally seriously, when taxes are based on profits, those who
    produce must pay twice, first to the landlord or landseller and then to support
    government through taxes on things that shouldn't be taxed.</p>

<p>Henry George: <a

  the Railroad Will Bring Us</a> [Californians, and particularly San
  Franciscans]&nbsp; (1868)<a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For years <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the high rate of interest and the high rate
of wages prevailing in California</span> have been special subjects for
the lamentation of a certain school of local political economists, who
could not see that high wages and high interest were indications that
the natural wealth of the country was not yet monopolized, that great
opportunities were open to all -- who did not know that these were
evidences of social health, and that it were as wise to lament them as
for the maiden to wish to exchange the natural bloom on her cheek for
the interesting pallor of the invalid?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But however this be, it is
certain that the tendency of the new era -- the more dense population
and more thorough development of the wealth of the State -- will be to
a reduction both of the rate of interest and the rate of wages,
particularly the latter.</span> This tendency may not, probably will
not, be shown immediately; but it will be before long, and that
powerfully, unless balanced and counteracted by other influences which
we are not now considering, which do not yet appear, and which it is
probable will not appear for some time yet.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The truth is, that the
completion of the railroad and the consequent great increase of
business and population, will not be a benefit to all of us, but only
to a portion</span>. As a general rule (liable of course to exceptions)
those who have it will make wealthier; for those who have not, it will
make it more difficult to get. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those who have lands, mines, established businesses,
special abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>those who have only their own labor will be come poorer,
and find it harder to get ahead -- 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>
    <li><small>first, because it will take more capital to buy land or
to get into business; and 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>second, because as competition reduces the wages of
labor, this capital will be harder for them to obtain.</small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What,
for instance, does the rise in land mean? Several things, but certainly
and prominently this: that it will be harder in future for a poor man
to get a farm or a homestead lot.</span> In some sections of the State,
land which twelve months ago could have been had for a dollar an acre,
cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In other words, the
settler who last year might have had at once a farm of his own, must
now either go to work on wages for some one else, pay rent or buy on
time; in either case being compelled to give to the capitalist a large
proportion of the earnings which, had he arrived a year ago, he might
have had all for of himself. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And
as proprietorship is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable
to the poor, more are forced into the labor market to compete with each
other, and cut down the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division
of their joint production between labor and capital more in favor of
capital and less in favor of labor.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>And so in San Francisco the rise in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for rent;
means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies courts,
slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small><br>
<br>
<small>San Francisco has one great advantage -- there is probably a
larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
lots than in any other city of the United States. The product of the
rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the great
social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship cannot
be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the princely
domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the pueblo was
not appropriated to furnishing free, or almost free, homesteads to
actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into the hands of a
few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been taken up in time
and in a proper spirit, this disposition might easily have been
secured, and the great city of the future would have had a population
bound to her by the strongest ties-a population better, freer, more
virtuous, independent and public spirited than any great city the world
has ever had.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To say that "Power is constantly stealing from the many to the
few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends to
concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the new
era into which California is entering, its operations will be more
marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great centralizer. It
kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the same way kills
little businesses and builds up great ones. We have had comparatively
but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning "very rich" has in
these times. But the process is going on. The great city that is to be
will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts and Spragues, and he who
looks a few years ahead may even now read their names as he passes
along Montgomery, California or Front streets.&nbsp; With the
protection which property gets in modern times -- with stocks, bonds,
burglar-proof safes and policemen; with the railroad and the telegraph,
after a man gets a certain amount of money it is plain sailing, and he
need take no risks. Astor said that to get his first thousand dollars
was his toughest struggle; but when one gets a million, if he has
ordinary prudence, how much he will have is only a question of life.
Nor can we rely on the absence of laws of primogeniture and entail to
dissipate these large fortunes so menacing to the general weal. Any
large fortune will, of course, become dissipated in time, even in spite
of laws of primogeniture and entail; but every aggregation of wealth
implies and necessitates others, and so that the aggregations remain,
it matters little in what particular hands. Stewart, in the natural
course of things, will die before long, and being childless, his wealth
will be dissipated, or at least go out of the dry goods business. But
will this avail the smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing
out? Not at all. Some one else will step in, take his place in the
trade, and run the great money-making machine which he has organized,
or some other similar one. Stewart and other great houses have
concentrated the business, and it will remain concentrated.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes to the effects of this
concentration of wealth. One millionaire involves the little existence
of just so many proletarians. It is the great tree and the saplings
over again. We need not look far from the palace to find the hovel.
When people can charter special steamboats to take them to watering
places, pay four thousand dollars for the summer rental of a cottage,
build marble stables for their horses, and give dinner parties which
cost by the thousand dollars a head, we may know that there are poor
girls on the streets pondering between starvation and dishonor.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When liveries appear, look out for
bare-footed children.</span> A few liveries are now to be seen on our
streets; we think their appearance coincides in date with the
establishment of the almshouse. They are few, plain and modest now;
they will grow more numerous and gaudy -- and then we will not wait
long for the children -- their corollaries.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But there is another side: we are to become a great, populous,
wealthy community. And in such a community many good things are
possible that are not possible in a community such as ours has been.
There have been artists, scholars, and men of special knowledge and
ability among us, who could and some of whom have since won distinction
and wealth in older and larger cities, but who here could only make a
living by digging sand, peddling vegetables, or washing dishes in
restaurants. It will not be so in the San Francisco of the future. We
shall keep such men with us, and reward them, instead of driving them
away. We shall have our noble charities, great museums, libraries and
universities; a class of men who have leisure for thought and culture;
magnificent theatres and opera houses; parks and pleasure gardens.</small><small>...<a
