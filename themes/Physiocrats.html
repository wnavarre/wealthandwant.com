  <p>DWARFED into mere revenue reform the harmony and beauty of free trade are
    hidden; its moral force is lost; its power to remedy social evils cannot
    be shown, and the injustice and meanness of protection cannot be arraigned.
    The "international law of God" becomes a mere fiscal question which appeals
    only to the intellect and not to the heart, to the pocket and not to the
    conscience, and on which it is impossible to arouse the enthusiasm that is
    alone capable of contending with powerful interests. &#8212; <em>Protection

THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders" who
have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the full
sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax, they proposed
the only means by which the free trade principle can ever be carried to its logical
conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade but of all other forms and
modes of production, with full freedom of access to the natural element which
is essential to all production. They were the authors of the motto that in the
English use of the phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez aller!" "Clear
the ways and let things alone." This is said to come from the cry that in medieval
tournaments gave the signal for combat, The English motto which I take to come
closest to the spirit of the French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em><br>

HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound, blindfolded, and
gagged. Shall we stand in a knot about him and discuss whether to put a piece
of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on his coat, or shall we dispute
with each other as to what road he ought to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle,
a horse and wagon, or a railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather
postpone such discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for
himself, speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
a torn coat, he may get on his feet, and if he cannot find a conveyance to suit
him, he will at least be free to walk. <br>
            <br>
Very much like such a discussion is a good deal of that now going on over "the
social problem" &#8212; a discussion in which all sorts of inadequate and impossible
schemes are advocated to the neglect of the simple plan of removing restrictions
and giving Labor the use of its powers. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The philosophy and economics
of using rent for community services and
sharing the rent equally is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoism</span>."
The economist Henry George popularized this idea, so it has been called
"Georgism" after him, although the concept was proposed a hundred years
earlier by the French economists calling themselves the Physiocrats, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">physiocracy
meaning the rule of natural law</span>.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Some geoists think that land rent belongs equally to
members of
local or global communities, so it should be distributed to the
residents in equal shares as a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">citizens'
dividend</span>" to spend on personal or civic services as the
individuals choose. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Other geoists think that all the natural rent and the
rentals due
to government civic works and services should be the "single tax" spent
primarily on governance and public goods, with any remaining revenues
distributed as dividends. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Anarchist geoists consider the rent and civic rentals as
the best
source of community revenue, but only among those who choose to belong
to such a community network. ...&nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The public and community
collection of rent puts
land at its most productive use, maximizing the wages of workers while
minimizing sprawl as well as boom/bust cycles. We need to understand

</small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, to define Distributive
Socialism we need to define
"<b><i>surpluses</i></b>." These are primarily rents from lands and
resources given by nature. In an open tax jurisdiction, labor and
capital are mobile and their supply is elastic; only land is fixed.
Land rent is the basic taxable surplus. Where there is no land rent,
an attempt to levy any tax can only abort production and land use,
rather than collect the tax. Where is there no land rent? </small><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First,
there is no rent generated on "marginal" land that is just barely
worth using at all. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, and more generally, there is no rent
generated by marginal increments of labor and capital applied on any
land, from the best to the worst. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Otherwise, all production on land
generates some rent, which is a taxable surplus. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>The statement above expresses "The Physiocratic Doctrine" of tax
  incidence, harking back to Francois Quesnay, and even earlier writers
  like John Locke and Jacob Vanderlint. The Doctrine has staying power:
  it is used, for example, by Bogart, Bradford, and Williams writing in
  the National Tax Journal, December, 1992, on tax incidence in New
  Jersey. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital,
unlike land, migrates
among taxing jurisdictions.</span> The
return to reproducible, depreciable capital is not, therefore,
generally a surplus. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital differs
from land.</span> Capital has to be
attracted, and, if domestically generated, dissuaded from emigrating.
It is true that in the short run existing capital, if affixed to
land, cannot be exported. Its returns thereby become a temporary
taxable surplus -- hence the name "quasi-rent." Capital can still be
dissaved, however, through neglect of maintenance, and will not be
replaced. The demonstration effect of disappointing old investors'
earlier expectations will have a high cost in repelling future
investing by them and others. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Old
buildings, unmaintained, will shed
blight on their surroundings. Non-replacement, in a dynamic world,
guarantees early obsolescence. </span>Capital finds many subtle ways
of
emigrating, or being disinvested and consumed. Its yields are not
really a taxable surplus when we factor in the consequences of trying
to tax them: withering away of the community. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Physiocratic rule, which may
seem novel and subtle in tax
discourse, stands out nakedly whenever landowners, public or private,
negotiate leases. If a lessee is required to pay a share of his gross
sales (a <span style="font-weight: bold;">royalty</span>), he
compensates by offering that much less on the
"bid variable," (often a "bonus" paid up front). Lessors and lessees
understand this well: it is central to all their negotiations.
Whatever the twists and turns, the rule of compensation applies: take
more here, get less there. The lessee is to supply labor and capital
at full cost; acquiring use of land will yield him a surplus above
costs. That surplus is all he can and will pay for. The maximum of
economic surplus is the rent of land in its highest and best legal
use. <strong>...</strong></small><small><font><small></small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font><small><small>...</small></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Distributive Socialism, then, means tapping
land and resource
rents for the public.</span> On the public domain, acknowledged to be
public
property, the institutional basis of Distributive Socialism is fully
in place. We need only apply a good leasing system, keeping rent
payments up to current values. On fee simple lands, Distributive
Socialism means and requires modifying tax systems to rifle in on
rents. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rifling
in is essential. Recall, the Physiocratic rule of
compensation says all taxes are shifted to rents anyway; some take
that to mean any tax will do. </span>However, "broad-based" taxes like
VAT
or a general sales tax sterilize lands that would be just marginal
before tax. They also abort all marginal and near-marginal activity
on all lands, for marginal inputs (where marginal cost equals price)
generate no rent. That in turn forces rates to be kept low, to avoid
destroying half the economy. Such taxes socialize all the rent from
lands that are now made marginal after-tax, but leave most rent
untapped on the most rentable lands and resources. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes that rifle
in on rent, on the other hand, inherently exempt marginal activity.
They may be set at very high rates, tapping more of the taxable
surplus, or rent. </span><small><font><small><small

You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems.

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Progress and Poverty</em> is the first and only thorough, complete,
    scientific inquiry ever made into the fundamental cause of industrial depressions
    and
      involuntary poverty. The ablest minds of the century attacked and condemned
      it &#8212; Professor Huxley, the Duke of Argyll, Goldwin Smith, Leo XIII,
      Frederic Harrison, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain. Nevertheless, in a
      preface to the
      definitive edition, George said what very few authors of a technical work
      have ever been able to say, that he had not met with a single criticism
      or objection
      that was not fully anticipated and answered in the book itself. For years
      he debated its basic positions with any one who cared to try, and was never
      worsted.</p>
  <p>... Like John Bright, nearly every one credited the &#8220;American inventor&#8221; a
      brand-new discovery in his idea of confiscating economic rent. George did in
      fact come by the idea independently, but others whom he had never heard of
      came by it long before him. Precisely the same proposal had been made in the
      eighteenth century by men whom Mr. Bright might have thought twice about snubbing &#8212; the
      French school known as the Economists, which included Quesnay, Turgot,
      du Pont de Nemours, Mirabeau, le Trosne, Gournay. They even used the term <em>l&#8217;impot
      unique</em>, &#8220;the single tax,&#8221; which George&#8217;s American
      disciples arrived at independently, and which George accepted. The idea
      of confiscating
      rent also occurred to Patrick Edward Dove at almost the same time that
      it occurred to George. It had been broached in England almost a century
      earlier by Thomas
      Spence, and again in Scotland by <a href="Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">William
      Ogilvie</a>, a professor at Aberdeen. George&#8217;s doctrine of the confiscation
      of social values was also explicitly anticipated by Thomas Paine, in his
      pamphlet called <em>Agrarian Justice</em>.</p>
  <p>George&#8217;s especial merit is not that of original discovery, though his
      discovery was original &#8212; as much so as those of Darwin and Wallace. It
      was simply not new; Turgot had even set forth the principle on which George
      formulated the law of wages, though George did not know that any one had done
      so. George&#8217;s great merit is that of having worked out his discovery
      to its full logical length in a complete system, which none of his predecessors
      did; not only establishing fundamental economics as a true science, but
      also
      discerning and clearly marking out its natural relations with history,
      politics, and ethics. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The concept of taxing land values for public finance is ancient. The
        Bible declares &#8220;the profit of the Earth is for all&#8221; (Ecclesiastes
        5:9). Land rent financed government in England during the Middle Ages.9
        During the 1700s, some French economists proposed an &#8220;<em>imp&ouml;t
        unique</em>&#8221; or single tax on land value. Calling their theory &#8220;physiocracy&#8221; (the
        rule of natural law), they outlined a model of economic development that
        used land value taxes to finance public works, which increased the value
        of the land (and thus increased taxes paid to the treasury), resulting
        in an upward spiral of development and prosperity. The principal physiocratic
        economist, Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay, wrote</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <em>Taxes ... should be laid directly on the net product of landed
            property</em>, and not on men&#8217;s wages, or on produce, where
            they would increase the cost of collection, operate to the detriment
            of trade, and destroy every year a portion of the nation&#8217;s
