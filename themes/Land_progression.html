<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Land's highest and best use progresses
  from wild to agricultural to single family housing to commercial, and then
    to more and more intense use.&nbsp;
  When a particular site's use progresses faster than it needs to, we call it
  urban sprawl.&nbsp; When a well-located site  is held out of use, or remains
  in a lower
  use
  than its current highest and best use, we call it underused or
  blighted.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When land in the central business district is put to
    its highest and best use, land on the fringes is preserved in its wild
    or agricultural state.&nbsp; Commutes are shorter, wages higher,
    infrastructure and services costs minimized.&nbsp;&nbsp; A historic
    cottage in the downtown may be a wonderful reminder of the town's past,
    but for many purposes, it is no better than a hole in the ground.&nbsp; Specialized
    businesses will almost always prefer to located in the central business district,
    because business will be better if they can
  draw customers and employees from a 360 degree radius.</p>
  <p>We may find progress quite upsetting.&nbsp; Open fields we remember from
    childhood give way to subdivisions.&nbsp; Subdivisions of homes that seemed
    palatial when we were children are being torn down because the split-level
    or single-story homes that served well now are considered too small or obsolete,
    and are often places that are now considered quite well-located,
    served by highways, public transportation, infrastructure, established schools.&nbsp; Older
    single family homes downtown  which once housed the town's most successful
    business people and professionals are now subdivided into apartments, or
    torn down to be replaced by low-rise or even high-rise condominiums.&nbsp; We
    may mourn the passing of an era, or the absence of beloved reminders of our
    earlier years.&nbsp; But we fail to remember that the downtown of our childhood
    had not been that way forever.  </p>
  <p>Teardowns are a sign of progress, of the reuse of our best sites.&nbsp; They
    are a reminder that tastes change, technology improves, but locations close
    to the centers of activity are in high demand.   Put them to a better use.&nbsp;     </p>

A. When the home place now becomes valuable, it is parted with.</p>
  <p><em>Q51. Yes; but when the home place is parted with now, the home owner
      is compensated by the high price he gets.</em><br>
  A. Then your question does not turn upon the home sentiment but upon the dollar
  sentiment. As a matter of sentiment, the condition would be no worse in any
  case than now, and in many cases far better; as a matter of dollars, the question
  is one of justice and not of the home. Under the single tax any one who wanted
  a home could have it, and never be obliged to abandon one home for another,
  unless such changes took place in the neighborhood as to make the place inappropriate
  for a home. He could not then, as he does now, play dog in the manger, saying
  to the community, &quot;I will not use this place for appropriate purposes,
  nor will I allow any one else to do so.&quot;... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I do not think the Leader of the
Opposition could have chosen a
more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of
that great community for land was for not more than forty acres a
year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does
that really represent the complete economic and natural demand for
the amount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I
will admit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford
to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room
tenements; and we are told that the utmost land those people can
absorb economically and naturally is forty acres a year.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the explanation? Because
the population is congested in
the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
congested within the city. That is the position which we are
complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
hitherto dominated civilised society.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The "Poor Widow"
Bogey</b></small>
<br>
<small>But when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this
unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the widow</span>.
But that personality has been used to
exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,
overtime of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so
soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
life should become larger than it is at present.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the position disclosed
by the argument? On the one hand,
we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
spreads and who would not really be in the least injured. </small><small>...

<small>References</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The optimal timing of development
is an important allocative
function that can be either enhanced or degraded by the impact of
land taxes on land speculation. This paper discusses four types of
taxes on land: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>taxes on the rental value of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on the sale value of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on realized income from land, and </small></li>
  <li><small>taxes on realized gains from the sale of land. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All four taxes reduce incentives
for speculation in land, which is
generally beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with
respect to incentives to develop land, while the first and second do
not. All four taxes have some beneficial effect of mitigating
imperfections in capital markets. All permit reduction or elimination
of taxes with significant dead-weight losses, such as those on
improvements.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Abstract from the continuous
divisibility of land
and suppose that land comes in "sites." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">At each moment in time, each
site is in one of three states:</span>
</small></p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small>1. Suitable for agriculture. </small>
    <p><small>2. Suitable for housing.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>3. Suitable for commercial activity.</small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While
each site can be used for any activity, the net return will
be greatest if it is used for the activity for which it is suited,
provided that it remains in that activity long enough to fully
amortize the associated capital that is state-specific, durable and
immobile. </span>What could keep a site from remaining in an activity
long
enough to amortize the associated capital is that from time to time a
site makes a transition from state 1 to state 2 or from state 2 to
state 3. These transitions are imperfectly predictable. When a
transition from state 2 to state 3 occurs unexpectedly, the course of
action that maximizes the net return to the site may entail scrapping
prematurely the residential structure built there and building a
commercial structure. In such an instance, one may be able to look
backward and say that it would have been better not to have built the
residential structure at all, but rather to have left the site in
agricultural use until the transition to state 3 occurred. However,
such reckoning can affect investment decisions only to the extent
that transitions can be foreseen.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The transitions are assumed to be
costly to foresee, and to be
more costly to foresee when they will be occurring further in the
future. Like signs of spring, symptoms of a possible transition are
at first faint and unreliable, becoming more and more obvious and
certain as the time of the transition approaches.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition to the land management
motive for seeking to foresee
transitions, there is a speculative motive, which differs in form and
magnitude. While the land management motive is concerned with the
possibility that capital will be wasted on a site that is soon to
undergo a transition in state, the speculative motive arises from the
gains to be made from owning title to land at the time that its
better future prospects become generally known. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People differ in the costs they
incur in ascertaining whether the
signs present at a particular site herald a pending transition, and
how soon it will occur. Therefore those who have a comparative
advantage in foreseeing the transitions tend to do the speculating. A
speculator will incur the cost of ascertaining the significance of
the signs at a particular site if, based on that speculator's
experience, the probability of a transition given the signs,
multiplied by the increase in the current value of the property if
there is a transition, is greater than the sum of the cost of making
the determination, the transactions costs of acquiring the site and
the net cost of holding the site until its future prospects become
generally known. The activity of speculation yields a normal expected
private return to the funds spent on speculation, with particularly
skillful speculators also obtaining unusual returns to their unique
talents.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
speculative return from foreseeing future transitions arises
from holding title to land when pending transitions become generally
known. This return is a purely private return, with no corresponding
social return, since the land will increase in value whether or not
any given speculator holds it.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
land-management return from
foreseeing future transitions, on the other hand, arises from knowing
not to employ capital on sites where future transitions will cause
the capital to depreciate prematurely</span>. This is a social return,
since
it involves improving the allocation of scarce resources. There is no
necessary connection between the private return and the social
return. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An additional social cost of land
speculation was elucidated by
Harry Gunnison Brown (1927). He pointed out that when it is possible
to profit from land speculation, land will tend to be acquired by
those who have the most extreme beliefs about how much it will rise
in value, and that such beliefs will generally be more optimistic
than is warranted. Economists have given the name <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"winner's curse"
</span>(Milgrom &amp; Weber, 1982) to the phenomenon that those who bid
the
most tend to bid too much. The winner's curse can cause the whole
land market to become dominated by persons with extreme beliefs about
future rises in value, creating an artificial scarcity of land for
current use, as those who have land wait for illusory future
opportunities. The winner's curse is thereby shifted to society.</small></p>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Good for the economy, the PTS is also good
for the eco-system. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Were land levied,
the owners of the most valuable
sites would feel most pressure to develop; their sites tend to be
closer to the city center. Hence those owners draw any needed
development, infilling cities, sparing suburbs further encroachment.
</span>Other highly valued sites are those rich in natural resources.
Again,
using them more intensely frees up sites of lesser natural endowment.
Thus, besides conserving sites, the PTS also conserves resources.</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html">The Merits of Site
Value Taxation</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When one looks at the value of
land in any broad way, its value will be
highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the spring of 1998, one land parcel
(the building was to be razed)
of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's Times
Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
million,</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">19</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
more than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands
north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. </span>The
highest
value land is
typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
passed through. In this sense,
land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
egregious patterns of sprawl.&nbsp; ... <a

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But suppose that during the second five years something of a boom has set
      in, and a community is growing up. Land is in demand, and for the lessening
      area in the hands of the government two dollars per acre is freely offered
      as economic rent. Now our typical farmer must come up to the market price and
      pay two dollars an acre for his third five years, irrespective of whether he
      is making more or less out of his place.</p>
  <p>In his third five years the boom continues, and the community grows so fast
      that before the close of that period one corner of our friend's farm finds
      itself near the middle of a flourishing town. Five acres of it are needed for
      a public park, and five acres adjoining are wanted to cut up into building
      lots. As building lots, this part of the land will command a voluntary offer
      of a hundred dollars per year per acre of economic rent; and this fact establishes
      the land-value of the adjoining five acres needed for park purposes. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in a city,
      for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from some less
      far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against all comers
      and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax usually imposed
      upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>...</strong>The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Consistent
with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. </span>The ratio of building to land value, land to
total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
<small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel. <strong>...</strong></small><br>

<small>The conventional property tax, one taxing both land values and
improvement values, is analogous to a train with an engine at each end.
The tax on land value fosters improvement on the parcels with the
highest market and social value, while the tax on structures
discourages that very same thing. No wonder it is that economic
activities is stymied most in the urban centers and manifests itself in
areas where the least imposition of all has taken hold. As scholar
Jessica Matthews once put it,</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>In a now familiar
sequence, developers
reach for the cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is
left to fill in behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage
systems and schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and
schools are left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that
marches steadily outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside
the moving edge. Because residential development can't meet the public
bills, local governments compete for commercial investment with tax
discounts that deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes
then rise, providing an incentive for new development. Years of such
leap-frogging construction devours land at an astonishing pace.<span
