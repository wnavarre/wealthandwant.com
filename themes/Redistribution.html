<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What seem to be considered the
most radical propositions yet made
are those for the creation of a "peasant proprietary" &#8211; the State
to buy out the landlords and resell to the tenants, for annual
payments extending over a term of years, and covering principal and
interest. Waiving all practical difficulties, and they are very
great, what could thus be accomplished? Nothing real and permanent.
For not merely is this, too, but a partial measure, which could not
improve the condition of the masses of the people or help those most
needing help, but no sooner were the lands thus divided than a
process of concentration would infallibly set in which would be all
the more rapid from the fact that the new landholders would be
heavily mortgaged. The tendency to concentration which has so
steadily operated in Great Britain, and is so plainly showing itself
in our new States, must operate in Ireland, and would immediately
begin to weld together again the little patches of the newly created
peasant proprietors. The tendency of the time is against peasant
proprietorships; it is in everything to concentration, not to
separation. The tendency which has wiped out the small landowners,
the boasted yeomanry, of England &#8211; which in our new States is
uniting the quarter-sections of preemption and homestead settlers
into great farms of thousands of acres &#8211; is already too strong to
be resisted, and is constantly becoming stronger and more
penetrating. For it springs from the inventions and improvements and
economies which are transforming modern industry &#8211; the same
influences which are concentrating population in large cities,
business into the hands of great houses, and for the blacksmith
making his own nails or the weaver working his own loom substitute

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Constitutions must be amendable,
to allow for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into
them. This impinges on the protection of expectations, including those
regarded as property. Protection of property rights is achieved by
constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators to
reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from
reflecting new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would
reduce the value of property. There have been times in the past when
moral development has compelled societies to change laws in ways that
reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot
guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the
value of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the
possibility of such moral advances, we should design constitutions that
permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting
legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution.</small></div>

difficulties that are growing up in the United States-- 
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the lowness
of wages, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the scarcity of employment,

  <li><small>the fact that though labor is
the producer of wealth, yet everywhere the laboring class is the poor
class</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>--are all due to one great
primary wrong, that wrong which makes
the natural element necessary to all, the natural element that was
made by the Creator for the use of all, the property of some of the
people, that great wrong that in every civilized country disinherited
the mass of men of the bounty of their Creator. What we aim at is not
the increase in the number of a privileged class, not making some
thousands of earth owners into some more thousands. No, no; what we
aim at is to secure the natural and God-given right to the humblest
in the community--to secure to every child born in Ireland, or in any
other country, his natural right to the equal use of his native
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How can we secure that? We cannot
secure it by dividing the land
up equally, by giving each man or each family an equal piece. That is
a device that might suit a rude community, provided that, as under
the Mosaic code, those equal pieces be made unalienable, so that they
could never be sold away from the family. But under our modern
civilization where industry is complex, where land in some places is
very valuable and in other places of but little value, where it is
constantly changing in relative value, the equal division of the land
could not secure equality.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE way to secure equality is
plain. It is not by dividing the
land; it is by calling upon those who are allowed possession of
pieces of land giving special advantage to pay to the whole
community, the rest of the people, aye, and including themselves--to
the whole people, a fair rent or premium for that privilege, and
using the fund so obtained for the benefit of the whole people.
</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What we would do would be
to make the whole people the general
landlord, to have whatever rent is paid for the use of land to go,
not into the pockets of individual landlords, but into the treasury
of the general community, where it could be used for the common
benefit.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, rent is a natural and just
thing. For instance, if we in this
room were to go together to <span style="font-weight: bold;">a new
country</span> and we were to agree that
we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we
divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue
equality? If it were proposed that we should divide it up into equal
pieces, there would be in the first place this objection, that in our
division we would not fully know the character of the land; one man
would get a more valuable piece than the other. Then as time passed
the value of different pieces of land would change, and further than
that if we were once to make a division and then allow full and
absolute ownership of the land, inequality would come up in the
succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another man, on
the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one man
would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
little while many of these people would have parted with their land
to others, so that their children coming after them into the world
would have no land. The only fair way would be this -- that any man
among us should be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use
it, that no one else wanted to use; that where more than one man
wanted to use the same piece of land, the man who did use it should
pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being used for the
benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. That
would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE problem is how to apply that
to an old country. True we are
confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. Now one
of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for
the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I
do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
that time a most important <b>third way</b>, and that is the way we
advocate.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what
we call the single tax. We
propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone -- not
upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
a house. <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html"><span

Henry George:<a href="../HG/justice_the_object_taxation_the_means.html"> Justice
the Object -- Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We used to be confronted
constantly by the question: "Well,
after you have divided the land up, how do you propose to keep it
divided?" We don't meet that question now. The Single Tax has,
at least, this great merit: it suggests our method; it shows the way
we would travel &#8212; the simple way of abolishing all taxes, save one
tax upon land values. Now, mark: One tax upon land values. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We do not propose a tax upon land,
as people who misapprehend us
constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; we propose a tax
upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A tax
that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
increment; that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes to
the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
them.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Now, the distinction between a tax on land and a tax on land
values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
community. But a tax on land values cannot fall on all land, because
all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
valuable land in proportion to its value;</span> therefore, it can no
more
become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
privileges of any kind. It can merely take from the individual, not
the earnings of the individual, but that premium which, as society
grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior
quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The focus of Henry George&#8217;s
inquiry, and of his disciples, is the
pursuit of justice. Economic justice is an agenda which ecological
economists also subscribe to, even though their immediate focus is
concern about the earth&#8217;s survival at all, let alone the distribution
of its fruits. Here, however, is where the Georgist tradition is able
to contribute most to the environmental justice program. There is a
broad appreciation, particularly among ecological economists that have
worked in poorer nations, that natural resources are endangered every
bit as much by the scarcity of basic necessities as by overpopulation.
Urban elites usurp high value lands and retain land rents growing out
of their production; poor people are marginalized and left to fend for
themselves. They often survive by taking what little environmental
resources are left on ravaged land sites, further reducing the
resiliency of these local ecologies. Collection and redistribution of
land rents, either in the form of public services or in the form of a
citizens&#8217; dividends, offers a way to restore equity without
redistribution of land titles and without all the dislocations this
might entail.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third world leaders
at the present time see
solutions to poverty and economic inequality in the redistribution of
land titles. Georgists argue that this is not necessary; all that is
necessary is to recover the land rent and assure its equitable
distribution to rightful claimants.&nbsp; </span>... <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Changing.html">Being Just While Conceptions
    of Justice are Changing: 7 Cases </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Case 4.</b> There is an agricultural society in which land is initially
    redivided equally each year among all adults. Then a band of marauders invades
    and claims ownership of all land by right of conquest. The marauders form a
    ruling oligarchy and create tradable land titles, which they parcel out equally
    among themselves. The original inhabitants are allowed to continue to use most
    of the land in exchange for payments of rent. They are also allowed to buy
    land. Two generations later, the softer descendants of the marauders succumb
    to pressures to implement a democracy. At a time when 90% of the land is in
    the hands of descendants of the marauders, a democratically elected parliament
    implements a tax of 100% of the
  rental value of land.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For this case, the descendants of the marauders have no claims to
      compensation. Those who bought land from the marauders or their descendants
      have respectable claims against the sellers, as in Case 3. But such claims
      cannot always be satisfied. A profligate son of a marauder may have sold all
      the land he inherited, spent the proceeds on high living and died penniless,
      leaving nothing to his heirs. If there is no reason why some buyers of land
      should be compensated but not others, and if there are substantial fortunes
      that can be identified as the products of land sales, then it may be sensible
      to have an aggregate compensation scheme, in which all persons who sold land,
      and their heirs, are required to compensate all persons who had purchased land.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Case 5.</b> Land has been privately owned and rather equally distributed
    since time immemorial. One day people suddenly realize that land should be
    regarded as the heritage of all citizens. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The new realization entails redistribution from current citizens
      to future ones. It cannot be achieved without making current citizens worse
      off. Virtually all current citizens have participated in the past legitimization
      of private ownership of land by buying and selling land titles. But there is
      no realistic possibility of identifying how much of the assets of any person
      were derived from appropriations and sales of land.
    </p>
    <p>In these circumstances, there may be no class of individuals who can reasonably
        be called upon to finance compensation. Financing compensation by either
        a tax on wages or a capital levy could only be justified by a high correlation
        between the tax base and unjust enrichment under the previous order. It
        may be most appropriate to simply allow losses from the new understanding
        to lie where they fall and handle any resulting case of true distress by
        whatever system is used to care for other persons who are not able to provide
        for themselves.</p>
    <p>If, despite the difficulties, a compensation scheme were implemented,
        it would at least be possible to reduce claims for compensation by the
        amounts of claimants' past gains from rises in the price of land. A person
        who has been the beneficiary of a rise in land values because of population
        growth and expansion of public services cannot reasonably complain if subsequent
        moral development eliminates those gains.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Case 6. </b>This is a variation on case 5, where
    the recognition that equal access to land should be a birthright occurs gradually,
    over decades. As the recognition develops momentum, the price of land begins
    to fall because people believe that if it succeeds, land may have no sale value
    and there may be no compensation. After 30 years of public debate, the movement
    has achieved the degree of acceptance necessary to implement a constitutional
    amendment that will cement the new understanding. The only question that remains
    to be decided is what compensation, if any, will be granted to people for the
    loss of sale value of their land.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here, whatever strength there may have been to the claim for compensation
      is attenuated by the discounted transactions. Anyone who knows that the price
      of an asset that he or she buys is lower because of the possibility that a
      new understanding of justice will prevail has a hard time arguing for compensation
      once it does prevail. It should be noted that in this case the attenuation
      does not apply to the claims of those who hold land throughout the period of
      discounting.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Case 7.</b> This is a variation on case 6, where
    there are initially substantial taxes on labor and capital. The proposal that
    is put forward entails removing from labor and capital taxes that yield revenue
    equal to the revenue that can be raised by collecting the full rental value
    of land. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For this case, compensation has all the difficulties of Case 6. But
      if there is to be a compensation scheme, the magnitude of any claim for
      compensation can be reduced by the claimant's expected savings in future
      taxes on labor
      and capital. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Changing.html">read the whole article</a></p>

        Efficiency and Preventing Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</a></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two of the most troublesome features of taxation and public spending are that
    taxation relies on coercion, and that the combination of taxing and public
    spending generates substantially haphazard redistribution. People must pay
    their taxes on penalty of having their property confiscated, or of going to
    jail. And we cannot
  say that this process is for everyone's good.</p>
  <p>There is reason to believe, though we do not have the basis to say for sure,
    that some people receive much less in benefits from public spending than they
    pay in taxes. How do we justify the harm that is thereby done to some persons
    by the combination of taxing and public spending? I would like to address this
    question by first discussing some possible justifications that might seem attractive,
    but should be rejected.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One possible justification is <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservatism</span>:
        Things have always been done this way. Our institutions have evolved to solve
        social problems that we may not even be aware of. Who knows what terrible
        things might happen if we did things differently?
          <p>There is an element of validity to the conservative position, but not
            an adequate basis for making conservatism the primary principle of social
            organization. If we had adopted conservatism as the primary principle
            of social organization centuries ago, there would have been no end to
            slavery, no women's suffrage, nor any of the numerous other changes in
            social organization in response to improvements in our moral understanding.
            It would be foolhardy to assert that we will never experience further
            improvements in our moral understanding that will call for changes in
            social organization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>A second possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarianism</span>: Once we have voted we know
        the right thing to do. The possibility of majority-rule cycles undermines
        the simple-minded version of majoritarianism that says that the majority
        is always right. Still, it would be possible to assert that majorities
      should have their way when cycles are not observed, and that when they
      are observed,
        some device for cutting through cycles can restore the viability of majoritarianism.
        However, that would give free rein to any majority to exploit any minority.
        That makes no sense as a theory of justice. One could assert that voters,
        acting as judges of what is best rather than as self-interested advocates,
        have a claim to determine in a majoritarian fashion what a collectivity
      ought to do. But then one still needs a theory of the principles by which
      the voters
        ought to judge. </li>
    <li>A third possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>: People should be required
          to provide as much for others as they have themselves. This theory
      suffers from the difficulties of vagueness and questionable operationality.
      As much
          what? There is no way to ensure that all persons will have equal quantities
          of such valued things as affection, talent or self-confidence. It is
      possible to imagine a crude egalitarianism of goods, but only by eliminating
      all incentives
          to be productive. If equality is traded off against some other goal,
      then egalitarianism is no longer the first principle.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rawls manages to retain the primacy of egalitarianism without destroying all
    incentives to be productive by the maximin rule: <b>Laws should be designed
    to maximize the well-being of the least advantaged person.</b> This formulation,
    however, generates such anomalies as the following: If there are three persons,
    and the choice is either a distribution of $10,000, $12,000 and $50,0000, or
    a distribution of $10,001, $10,002 and $80,000, the <i>maximin</i> rule will
    select the latter, despite the fact that it makes the middle income person,
    who is already relatively poor, even poorer while making the richest person
    noticeably richer. In Rawls's particular formulation there is a further difficulty.
    He makes the <i>maximin</i> rule lexically subordinate to the rule that all
    persons should have the maximum individual liberty that all can have. However,
    he does not deal with the following problem: My individual liberty will be
    unnecessarily restricted if I am not allowed to sing you a song in exchange
    for a haircut (without being taxed), but if I am allowed to do so without being
    taxed, the maximin rule is not satisfied. If Rawls really does mean to put
    individual liberty lexically first, no redistributive income taxes would be
    permitted. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While none of these remedies in itself is unsound, all have a fatal disadvantage.
      The programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis or at a similar
    rate of development. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Housing measures have fluctuated at the whims of legislative bodies.
      They have been piecemeal and pygmy. </li>
    <li>Educational reforms have been even more sluggish and entangled in bureaucratic
          stalling and economy-dominated decisions. </li>
    <li>Family assistance stagnated in neglect and then suddenly was discovered
          to be the central issue on the basis of hasty and superficial studies. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>At no time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived.
      As a consequence, fragmentary and spasmodic reforms have failed to reach down
      to the profoundest needs of the poor.</p>
  <p>In addition to the absence of coordination and sufficiency, the programs of
      the past all have another common failing -- they are indirect. Each seeks to
      solve poverty by first solving something else.</p>
  <p><strong>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the
        most effective -- the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a
        now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.</strong></p>
  <p>Earlier in this century this proposal would have been greeted with ridicule
      and denunciation as destructive of initiative and responsibility. At that time
      economic status was considered the measure of the individual's abilities and
      talents. In the simplistic thinking of that day the absence of worldly goods
      indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber.

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land nationalisation.
      But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on land could be effective
      in capturing the economic surplus arising from land ownership. This tax
      would generate all the revenue necessary to fund public expenditures. George
      thought that such a land tax would permit the removal of other taxes on
      labour and capital, which he regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued
      that taxes on incomes, sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives
      to production and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and
      creating a barrier to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be
      both economically efficient and more equitable in its distributional effects.</p>
  <p>George&#8217;s advocacy of replacing all existing taxes with a single tax
    on land values was powerful. He argued that this tax would redistribute the
    wealth that would otherwise accrue to private landowners, forcing them to
    repay the community for their exclusive use of a public resource. Moreover,
    such redistribution would reduce wealth inequalities and allow massive improvements
    in welfare provisions and public services. In addition, removing taxes on
    labour and capital would boost economic growth and provide a stimulus to
    employment. Conversely, taxing land values would reduce speculation in land
    and depress land prices, allowing greater access to landownership while reducing
    economic instability. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
