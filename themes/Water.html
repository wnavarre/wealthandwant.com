    Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887
    speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"Thou shalt not steal." Well,
  according to some of them, it means: "Thou shalt not get into the
  penitentiary." Not much more than that with some. You may steal,
  provided you steal enough, and you do not get caught. Do not steal a
  few dollars &#8212; that may be dangerous, but if you steal millions and get
  away with it, you become one of our first citizens.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it
  mean? Well, it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It
  does not merely mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway
  robbery! There are other forms of stealing which it prohibits as well.
  It certainly means (if it has any meaning) that we shall not take that
  to which we are not entitled, to the detriment of others.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now, here is a desert. Here is a caravan going along over the
  desert. Here is a gang of robbers. They say: "Look! There is a rich
  caravan; let us go and rob it, kill the men if </small><small>necessary, take
  their goods from them, their camels and horses, and walk off." But one of the
    robbers says: </small><small>"Oh, no; that is dangerous; besides, that
    would be stealing! Let us, instead of doing that, go ahead to where
    there is a spring, the only spring at which this caravan can get water
    in this desert. Let us put a wall around it and call it ours, and when
    they come up we won&#8217;t let them have any water until they have given
    us all the goods they have." That would be more gentlemanly, more polite,
    and more respectable; but would it not be theft all the same? And is it
    not theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of
    population and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as </small><small>people come into the world and population increases, will not let
      this increasing population use the land until they pay an exorbitant price?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are
    founded. Do that under the false code of morality which exists here
    today and people will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and
    will say you have made money because you are a very superior person,
    and that all can make money if they will only work and be industrious!
    But is it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not
    steal," as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we ourselves
    must not steal. But does it not also mean that we must not suffer
    anybody else to steal if we can help it?</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
    suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we,
    all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime
    that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212; they
    are not to blame above anyone else, but we who permit them to monopolize
    land are also parties to the theft. ...&nbsp;<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>IV. Applications
to Resource Use</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is only a small step from
charging people for street use and
parks to charging them for renewable and exhaustible resources. <b>If
people who could fish as much as they wanted would deplete fish
stocks excessively, then some form of control over fishing is
beneficial. </b>It is possible in theory to have efficient control
through quotas, though it is difficult to set the quotas properly,
and highly contentious to change them when conditions require a
change. <b>The recognition that the fish are everyone's common
heritage would require that, if there are to be quotas, the quotas be
auctioned, and that if not, then everyone who fishes be required to
pay for fishing according to the loss in the value of fish stocks
that results from fishing.</b> If a fishing resource lies entirely
within a single nation (as in a lake or river), then the recipient of
the fees for fishing should be the polity that includes the resources
(Though the value of the fishing resource would be included in the
calculation of whether the nation was using more than its share of
global natural opportunities.) When the fishing resource is in
international waters, the fees should be shared equally among all
nations in proportion to their populations.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that fish are caught in a
river than flows from one nation
into another. How should resource use be managed and accounted for in
that case? The two nations should set a common price for fishing
(unless fishing on one entails a greater resource cost than fishing
in the other). However they divide the revenue from such charges,
their ability to collect the revenue should be included in the
calculation of how their appropriations of natural opportunities
compare with those of other nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What applies to fish applies as
well to water that flows from one
country into another, when water is scarce. It is inefficient as well
as unjust for people to use water as if it were free when it is not.
When a river flows from one nation into another, there should be a
common price for extractions of water from the river (unless the
resource cost is greater in one country than in the other), and the
revenue so collected should be included in the calculation of both
nations' appropriations of natural opportunities. <b>... </b><span

Global Economic Justice</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Applying the
Theory of Justice to Other Connections among Nations</b>
</small><br>
<small>The pre-development rental value of land is only the beginning
of
the natural opportunities to which all persons have equal rights.
Consider fishing in the oceans. If there were so many fish in the
oceans that the removal of some by the fishermen of one nation had no
detectable impact on the opportunities available to the fishermen of
other nations, then there would be no economic scarcity of fish in
the oceans as a natural opportunity, and the value of fish would
represent returns on the labor and capital of the fishermen, along
with some luck. But when fishing by one nation leaves noticeably
fewer fish for the others, the reduction in the value of fish stocks
caused by fishing represents an appropriation by that nation of the
common heritage of all, which needs to be accounted for in
establishing what compensation is needed to achieve an equal division
of natural opportunities. The pie to be divided now consists of the
sum of the pre-development rental value of all land plus the
depletion cost of the fishing that all nations do. A nation is fully
entitled to the proportion of this total represented by the
proportion of its population in total population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The same logic that applies to
fishing applies also to the rent
component of the value of all things--the iron and other metals in
products of all kinds, the gold and other resources in jewelry, the
component of land rent in lumber, etc. Each nation's use of such
resources must be included in the pie to be divided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes rivers flow from one
nation into another. If the
withdrawal of water by the upstream nation reduces the value of the
natural opportunities that are left to the downstream nation, then
this reduction in the value of the downstream opportunities is part
of what the upstream nation appropriates from the common heritage of
all nations. The total value of the available natural opportunities
is maximized while also achieving justice, if all withdrawals of
water by both nations are charged at a price that equates supply and
demand, the money so collected is counted as part of the pie to be
divided, and land is valued according to the rental value it would
have if unimproved,considering the price of water.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;

recently, with the advent of data availability and increased computer

that taxing what he called "land" - really meaning all natural capital

possible tax design we could have.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If these natural resources are
a
"commons" worthy of being preserved as the birthright of all humanity,
their use can be rented at rates sufficient to cover the costs of not
only the provision of those services but for all public needs. </span>All
taxes are ultimately shifted through the economy to rest on what
classical economists call land rent in any case, and levying the taxes
directly on rent improves efficiency by eliminating "deadweight loss."
Moreover,<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
taxing or collecting what classical economists call economic rent bears

<small>I wish I could report this has made us more
conscious of the problem than easterners, but if so that has not
reached the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MWDSC (Metropolitan Water
District of
Southern California)</span>,

<small>You think that's hyperbole?&nbsp; I wish!&nbsp;
"Only Yesterday," in the '70s, there were several Senators and a big
head of steam behind "NAWAPA," to tap the Yukon.&nbsp; Sensible,
economical conservation of local aquifers is too prosaic, and besides
it violates the American credo of preferring the most resource-using
solution.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Real men don't
conserve resources; real men have vision
and acquisitive genes, they sally forth like their warrior progenitors
and grab more.&nbsp; Conservation is for sissies and besides, it would
only demonstrate the folly of MWD's hydro-imperialism.&nbsp; </span>...&nbsp;</small>
Americans have yet to hear
this
alarm bell, and take a frighteningly insouciant attitude toward
groundwater.&nbsp; Even Earl Heady, an informed person, has written
that pesticides only hurt us by being concentrated via the food chain
(Nicol and Heady, 335).&nbsp; But in my little corner of the world,
southern California, many aquifers are being impaired, perhaps lost
forever by "downward runoff" or percolation of water laced with
toxics.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p><small>On public lands, when a bridge is new, and oversized for its
traffic, no toll should be charged: circumstances call instead for a
Green Light Tax on the benefited lands, to hasten their settlement.
When traffic queues up, however, it is time to charge a toll (and/or
to widen the bridge).</small></p>
<p><small>Likewise, when demand for water exceeds supply, it is time to
price it and charge people for withdrawing it from Nature. The
history of irrigation in California is instructive. During the
Populist and Progressive eras Californians developed the legal
framework for what we call <b>Irrigation Districts</b>, to divert,
store and distribute water. They raised funds by taxing land; most of
them delivered water free of variable cost. Likewise, no one charged
them for taking our water from our rivers. There was ample water, so
it seemed, running to waste, or into swamps. The result, from
1900-30, was to convert California from pasture and wasteland to the
#1 farm state in America. It was a Georgist object lesson, and a
brilliant success story. Quoth Albert Henley, a prominent
attorney,</small></p>
<blockquote><small>"The discovery of the legal formula of these
organizations
was of infinitely greater value to California than the discovery of
gold a generation before. They are an extraordinarily potent engine for
the creation of wealth."</small></blockquote>
<small>A worm in the apple was waste of water. The same policy that
promoted close economy and rapid conversion of land also tolerated
waste of water, and even subsidized it by basing the quantity of
rival water claims on histories of use - what economists now call
"rent-seeking." It was once a minor problem, but times change, and
"circumstances alter cases." Today we are stuck with much of our
water, a limiting natural resource, frozen in lower uses and withheld
from higher ones - exactly what Georgist policy is supposed to
prevent. The solution, clearly, is for the State to charge each
Irrigation District (and other diverters) per unit of water they
take, and reallocate the great surpluses they would immediately stop
taking.&nbsp; </small><small><b><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html"><b>Read

for Negabucks: Solving the Water
Crisis</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... When Henry George
wrote &#8220;We must make land common property&#8221; it was in a place
and at a time when most land in sight had been privatized only
recently, using crude methods. &#8220;Force and fraud&#8221; were not
dim memories in 1879, but a living presence. So George&#8217;s phrase
did not strike people then as being any more shocking than it is
today to remind them that the public domain, with its pasturelands,
waters, rights of way, the air, radio spectrum, fish, mineral riches
and timber, belongs to us all in common.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The California Constitution and
Water Code, like those of most
states, are explicit that &#8220;The waters of California belong to
the people of California.&#8221; Water is not private property,
evidenced by its not being taxed as such (except indirectly, as it
adds to the value of fee simple land). Water is not, therefore,
subject to the limits that Prop. 13 (and cognate laws in other
states) impose on property tax rates. The State, as owner, can
presumably charge whatever the legislature decides, without its being
considered a tax at all. Water claimants would of course resist
strenuously, with all the lawyers and pawns and media that money can
buy, and social pressure sway, but the public has a strong case.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It&#8217;s not just water <i>per se</i>,
but also the lands under
what were originally <b>shallow waters</b>. Most coastal cities have
increased their areas greatly by filling in shallow waters.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are four major ways that individuals and corporations
acquire the use of waters. <b> One is by riparian rights</b>. To own
the bank of a lake or stream is to have a right to the water,
theoretically &#8220;undiminished and unpolluted,&#8221; that nature
put there - subject to the equal rights of other riparians, but not
of anyone else.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A second way to claim water is by owning land overlying
ground
water, and the aquifers that store it.&nbsp; ... </b></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A third way to claim water is by &#8220;prior
appropriation.&#8221; </b> The key rules are &#8220;first in time,
first in right&#8221;; &#8220;due diligence&#8221;; &#8220;beneficial
use&#8221;; and &#8220;history of use.&#8221; The precondition for
putting water to &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; is owning land on which
to spread it.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Part of appropriating water is securing sites for dams and
reservoirs and rights of way, either from public domain or from
private owners by use of eminent domain. A major case is San
Francisco&#8217;s seizure of the site of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
inside Yosemite National Park. This scenic site on the Tuolumne
River once rivaled Yosemite Valley itself, on the neighboring Merced
River.<i> Rent has been $30,000 a year, fixed since the 1920s. The

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A fourth way to claim water is
by getting
&#8220;sweetheart&#8221; contracts from large supply systems: Federal
water from the Bureau of Reclamation; State water from the State
Department of Water Resources; and mixed-source waters from the giant
MWDSC.</b> No sooner are these contracts inked than learned
counselors go to work to convert them into perpetual obligations of
the taxpayers and other ratepayers. The original 40-year contracts
that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation executed on the 1950s at giveaway
prices came up for renegotiation in the 1990s, and only a few old
timers even remembered their origins. <b>Meantime the once-surplus
water had multiplied many times in value, and the contractors were
busy securing rights to resell water that they buy for some $10 per
acre-foot to coastal cities for $200-$500 per acre foot. </b> A
rather shocking decision by Senior Judge John Wiese, December 31,
2003, requires the Feds to compensate the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District for withholding some of &#8220;their&#8221; water to
comply with the Endangered Species Act to save fish downstream. Said
District is a front for the J.G. Boswell Company, owner of 200,000

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s the moral? We can turn
&#8220;Negabucks into
Megabucks&#8221; for state and Federal treasuries by charging water

to get it, as now. The stakes are huge; the barriers are

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In tapping
these many varieties of resources and tenures for
public revenues, citizens and their representatives may have to set
priorities. Two practical criteria rise to the top:

    </small></li>
  <li><small>go for the soft targets.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
biggest values are probably in energy, communications, water,
rights-of-way, zoning and street use.</span> Let's just look at what we
are
learning about <span style="font-weight: bold;">communications</span>.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Knowledge and entertainment
appear
both at top and bottom on man's hierarchy of needs.</span> People
without
even adequate shelter may be seen huddled around tv sets; people in
war, or under totalitarian governments, risk their lives to hear
smuggled broadcasts. People with higher incomes and security equip
themselves with mobile telephones, and call around the world; they
rush to get on the information highway. AT&amp;T was the biggest
non-financial corporation in the world before splitting up.
Newspapers depend on their "wire" services: one of the first Great
American Monopolies was Western Union and its news appendage, AP. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent
FCC auctions have fetched billions of dollars for spectrum
licenses, but this is like selling the badlands after giving away the
beachfronts. </span>The values of extant licenses given away ion the
past,
especially spectrum in top locations, are much higher. AT&amp;T
recently paid $112.5 billion for the McCaw Company's spectrum
licenses, which are a smattering of all that is out there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
licenses should be on the property tax rolls in the jurisdictions
that they cover. </span>The revenue possibilities are staggering.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How
about soft targets? </span>A soft target is any tenure recently
created, in a field that is easy to understand. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>come to
mind. In the last few years governments in Canada and the U.S. have
limited allowable fish hauls by excluding new fishing boats and
imposing quotas on the owners of old ones. This "imposition" amounts
to a gift. Some quotas swiftly rose in value to over $1 million each,
suddenly creating a class society where before there was equal
opportunity. There is now a class of nouveau, instant millionaires
and parlor fisherman who rent out their quotas to working
fishermen.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very
likely it is wise to limit fish catches and avoid the
"tragedy of the commons." It is also necessary to police the waters
and keep out alien interlopers, a dicey business calling for the full
power of a strong national government. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not necessary, however,
to give away the quotas so dearly policed.</span></span> It is obvious
to any
objective observer that the quotas should be sold or (better) leased
to the highest bidder. If the Feds insist on giving them away, states
and localities should class them as taxable property subject to a
high rate. The best time to levy appropriate charges is when quotas
are new, and the injustice of the present dispensation is apparent to
all.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span

Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small></a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One example has to do with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">irrigation</span>. About 60 to 80 years
ago,
1890-1930, irrigation was the refuge of the small farmer -- it was
the new frontier, and specifically in California. A lot of publicity
has been given to
something called the Irrigation District movement, whereby farms and
cattle ranches were incorporated into taxing districts or irrigation
districts, which
taxed land and exempted improvements and used tax powers to issue
bonds and build expensive irrigation units. And under this system,
people in the district
paid for water whether they used it or not, and caused a revolution
in California agriculture from 1900 to about 1930. It was a fantastic
case study in economic
development (which has been mostly ignored by academic and government
economists). As a result, the average size of a farm in California went
way down.
And the concentration of land went way down, and irrigation was at
the forefront of this.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>When irrigation was young in Anglo-America (1890-1914), it was
the
recourse of small farmers and ranchers. Then, vast spreads were
subdivided to create small irrigated farms. There was drastic
subdivision and
intensification (1900-1930). After the 1930s drop in property tax
rates, this land has been reconsolidated. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you don't tax land, conglomeration
occurs
inexorably. </span>The sections buy out the quarters. This has
happened in
irrigated agriculture faster than almost anywhere else. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. Irrigated land is worth a lot more than
dry land. </span></small><small><a

the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Substituting
taxes for
subsidies to promote conservation, turning "Negabucks into Megabucks"
for the treasury.&nbsp; </span>Water makes a good example. Now, as for
years past, we subsidize landowners to withdraw water. The benefits of
the subsidy are roughly in proportion to the area of irrigable land
owned. As a result, water is maldistributed, underpriced and wasted.
There is also great revenue potential in water. In an arid land, water
is life. The Constitution says that water belongs to "the people of
California." The State can serve market efficiency, conserve water, and
raise revenue in one stroke by putting a charge on water withdrawals.
Such a charge would also expedite the current movement to market water.
Many in the Green Movement also see the double efficacy of &#8220;Pigovian&#8221;
taxes (effluent charges that &#8220;tax bads, not goods&#8221;) to curtail overuse
and pollution of common airs and waters, while also raising revenue. <big><span

 style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Dissipation by open access</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It
is a truism of economic theory that open access to lands dissipates and
destroys potential rents, by overcrowding. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Open range</span> and fisheries are
classic examples from olden times. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries
</span>are being privatized only
in our times, and the rents, where observable, are often over half the
catch. Streets and highways are like open ranges, with cars and trucks
instead of cattle and sheep. The revenue potential of charging
motorists for squeezing into crowded streets is staggering. <a
 href="../auth/Vickrey.html">Wm.
Vickrey</a>, among others, has come up with vertiginous numbers. The
beauty
of it is that discouraging marginal trips by pricing actually can
increase the aggregate traffic flow, a double gain.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Access to underground &#8220;pools&#8221; of water and petroleum is limited to
overlying landowners, but even that degree of openness is enough to
destroy much potential rent that may be conserved by unitized control
or better, severance taxes.</small><br>

<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Private tenure is not the panacea for all resource problems, because
the process of creating tenure entails orgies of &#8220;soonerism.&#8221; Notorious

Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The very people who gave us
    the term laissez-faire -- the
    slogan at the core of a
    free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
    central part of their
    program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
    Century, sometimes
    called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
    and who inspired land
    reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
    Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
    A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
    accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
    </small><br>
    <small>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
    </small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
    learned to measure land values,
    and we have broadened
    the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
    </span>Agrarians will be relieved,
    and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
    well down the
    list in terms of total
    market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
    farms; only the very best
    soils in the best locations yield much taxable
    surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life, and the
    most valuable
    natural resource is water. </span>For
    example, in southern California we need water so much we
    import it from the
    Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
    through the long San Joaquin
    Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
    tunnel it through the
    San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
    gets here, it
    supplements and competes with local water that nature
    provides freely in the
    Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
    then has a value equal
    to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
    That value in the local
    waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
    to take that surplus
    value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
    and worse, we actually
    subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
    dams, canals, and
    pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
    asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
    that is called "dissipating
    rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
    time we learned to husband
    and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
    surplus. So should you, in
    comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
    generate power.</span> Again,
    California witlessly fails to
    socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
    has shown the way.
    British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
    Quebec, and other provinces
    raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
    water. Russia, with some of
    the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
    same, or better.
    </small><br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
    value.</span> In the past most
    nations have let this rent
    be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
    and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
    the number of licenses and
    boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
    It created large rents,
    where previously there were little or none, by preventing
    overfishing and the great
    waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
    fishing effort. That is a good
    example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
    necessary before you can
    collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
    give away this net benefit
    to private parties.
    <br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell these
    licenses, but simply
    gave them away to owners
    of existing boats, and others with political influence.
    Each license now sells for
    something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
    instant millionaires and
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
    giveaway to the few, and takeaway
    from the many,
    created an instant class society where before there were
    equal access and equal
    opportunities. <br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
    privileges are worth so much that there are now
    documented cases off
    Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
    catch. </span>The captain, the
    crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
    the dangers and
    discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
    with the other 30%. Parlor
    fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
    socialized, relieving the
    workers from taxes.

    Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These are subsidies
    that encourage
    harmful things like 
    </small>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><small>polluting air and water, 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>wasting
      water, 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>cutting timber
      whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>populating remote regions
      whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
  </ul>
  <p><small>
    Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
      contains the most
      polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
      to sustain its
      uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
      that employ just a few
      people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
      North America. <br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
    <br>
    We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
      withdraw scarce
      water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
      The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
      artifact of such
      misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
      Colorado is actually
      subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
      the privilege. If they
      paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
      the Treasury, which
      could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
      saving.
    <br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
      asset, our national
      forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
      subsidizing forest roads in
      subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
      in good areas,
      but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
      to get $1 in
      revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
      destroying scenic values
      and watershed protection.
    <br>
&nbsp;
    <br>
    Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
      and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Owns Southern California?</a><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. HOLDINGS BY ALIENS&nbsp; ...
      Non-resident aliens own about 75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A.
      CBD west of Broadway ...</small><br>
    <small>2. AMERICANS FROM OTHER STATES ... </small><small>
    A second kind of holder is the out-of-state American, individual or
      corporate.</small><br>
    <small>3. CALIFORNIANS Many of our largest landholders also live in
      California. This is partly
      because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
      California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
      property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his
      residence. California ranks after New York in the number of rich
    Americans (using Forbes' list) who reside here.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>
    Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
      are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
      exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
      financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
    certainty.</small><br>
    <small>4. INSTITUTIONS</small><br>
    <small>
    Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
      stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
      they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
      to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
      opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
      their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
      Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
    Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>
    <br>
    <br>
    <small>These same interests wield special influence on private and
      public
      higher education, working behind the scenes. They stand in well with
      the press: in fact, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chandler
      family of the Times-Mirror Company</span> is one of them, owning the
      vast Tejon Ranch. Scott Newhall was once editor of the San Francisco
      Chronicle. (It is alleged by Stanley Sapiro that "the Newhall ranch was
      assembled by the owners of the San Francisco Chronicle." ) They
      dominate Chambers of Commerce. They generally dominate the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Metropolitan Water District of Southern
      California (MWDSC)</span>, the regional water supply agency, which has
      long overtaxed the City of Los Angeles to subsidize expansion to
      outlying areas.<br>
    <br>
    The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is run by a
      Board of 50 Directors, representing 27 cities and districts that it
      serves. Those from cities are elected on the basis of
"one-person-one-vote." Those from several outlying districts are
      elected by "one-acre-one-vote." Representatives from landowner-run
      districts remain the same from election to election, thus gaining
      seniority to dominate the 50-person Board.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Thus a
      handful of speculative landowners have as many votes as millions
    of city residents.</span> Accordingly, MWDSC preaches water
      conservation in
      the cities while it keeps annexing new speculations at its fringes. It
      is probably no accident that its current President represents the
      Western Municipal Water District of Riverside County, an area dominated
      by land speculators. Many economists have criticized its persistent
      refusal to consider any kind of economically rational, cost-justified
    rate structure. ...&nbsp;</small>

  Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
    Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
      one
      thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
      the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
      political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
      tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
      address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
      could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
      buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
      the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
      powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
      efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
      site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
      is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
    <br>
    <font size="3"><small>About a 100 years ago, California adopted the
      land tax for a while. The
      legislature allowed irrigation districts to fund dam and canal
      construction by taxing the resultant rise in land value. This
      legislation was the fruit of the effort of one legislator, C. Wright,
      who left teaching school to run for office, pass his bill, then
      returned to teaching. As voters, farmers were beginning to have more
      representation than rich ranchers. Then the idea of a Single Tax on
      land values, made popular by writer <a href="../George_P&P.html">Henry
      George</a>, was current.
      Unfortunately, once the irrigation improvements were paid for, the land
      tax was allowed to languish, as speculators regained political control.
    ...</small></font><br>
    <br>
    <font size="3"><small>A century ago, many farmers and miners went
      without water because cattlemen like Henry Miller owned 1,000,000 acres
      in California. Miller could drive his herds from Mexico to Oregon and
      spend every night on his own land. In 1886 Mill won full rights to the
      water of the Kern River. To correct this aggrandizement, the state
      allowed communities to create by popular vote irrigation districts to
      build dams and canals and pay for them by taxing the increase in land
      value. Once irrigated, land was too valuable to use for grazing, and
      the tax made it too costly for hoarding. So cattlemen sold off fields
      to farmers and at prices the farmers could afford. In ten years, the
      land rent tax turned the Central Valley into over 7,000 independent
      farms. Over the next decades, those treeless, semi-arid plains became
    the garden of America. ... </small></font><br>
    <br>
    <font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
      needs a
      matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
      we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
    earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

  Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_18F.html">18 Fallacies</a><br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1. "Water rights
  are real property"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! To begin, the word 'right'
is wrong. A right is something
like free speech, possessed by everyone. The only water rights,
properly speaking, are common, which present water permits certainly
are not. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Private water interests are
claims, licenses, permits, holdings,
reservations, privileges, or possessions. I do not say 'property,'
except in reference to the state, water is the property of the
states. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most private water claims are
licenses, at least in the 17 western
states. Most state constitutions read that the water of a state
belongs to the state (in trust for the people of the state). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If economists have two hands, (on
the other hand!) a lawyer has
more than a squid has arms, and as much ink to darken the waters.
Murky ideas make for clouded titles and blinded citizens. Now and
again, however, one finds a pure ray of light like this from Oregon
Chief Justice McBride: -- "It does not seem to me that a license to
appropriate water in this State ever rose above the dignity of a mere
privilege over which The legislature has complete control." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A water license has about the same
standing as 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the privilege some
airlines had (before deregulation) to occupy certain airport gates
and time slots; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the privilege of a cab to work the streets of New
York after securing a medallion; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>a license from the FCC to use a
specified frequency; or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>a grazing permit on Federal lands. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is like the old Oregon and
California Railroad land grant which
was revested when the grantee failed to perform. It is subject to
conditions and to forfeiture for failure to meet same.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
evidence is, you do not find
water licenses recorded like
title deeds to real property. More important, you do not find them on
the real estate tax rolls. Never have I heard a licensee demand to be
taxed because he holds real property.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lawyers habitually intone
'property' when describing water
permits, especially their clients'. This is ceremonial and
tendentious, to bolster the particular case. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is also a group shibboleth, to
bolster all clients' cases
against all the outside, unlicensed public. Call it a class bias.
After all, most lawyers get in this field to represent licensees,
individually and collectively. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The upshot is that The Legislature
has more latent power than most
of us imagine. As electors and citizens our hands are not fled, but
rather our minds. That's part of a lawyer's job, and they are good at
it. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>5. "The cost of
water is passed through to consumers in higher prices"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! At last I'm in my own
field. Prices are determined by
supply and demand, not cost. If you sell in a national or world
market, or even a competitive local market, you are a price-taker,
not a price-maker. You can't pass cost hikes on to consumers; you
have to eat them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, water (like energy)
is an unusual kind of input whose
high price may actually increase production. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be easy to assume, using
the good old idea of diminishing
returns, that dearer water would reduce intensity of land use. </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>It certainly
cuts water use, but when you pay more for water you
often switch to higher-valued crops. That is what Southern California
farming is all about. You substitute capital and labor for water on
the same land, and often raise yields per acre. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">You
cannot afford to dump high-priced water on barley, or alfalfa,
or rice, or irrigated pasture, or any other of these domesticated
phreatophytes that guzzle up most of our underpriced water today.</span>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A number of fairways and
cemeteries would also give way to
higher-valued uses. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With dearer water you use less by
controlling it better, switching
from primitive furrow irrigation to sprinklers, spitters and drip.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This in turn lets you do new
things like growing avocados on steep
hillsides formerly barren, yielding more dollars of product for less
water (and in this case on waste land). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The above facts point to a
fascinating, portentous corollary:
you can tax water withdrawals without wrecking the water economy.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the contrary, such taxes
(carefully crafted to be constructive)
can encourage conservation, getting more bins and bales for the
bucket, so to speak. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Americans are raised on anti-tax
slogans masquerading as economic
analysis, always presuming taxes destroy good incentives and wreck
the economy. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a kind of tax that raises
revenue while strengthening the
economy. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This corollary is too good to
drop, and is highlighted later.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>6. "You
can't stop
a landowner from pumping on his own land"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! You can even control his
hunting and fishing there, and
apply police power. As to pumping, it depends on whether he owns what
is under his land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is oil, we all know mineral
rights are routinely severed
from surface rights by sale, reservation or lease. Water can be
subject to constraints, too. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Limits on pumping water are not as
common or severe as Huey
Johnson and I think they should be, but they do exist. In coastal
areas, pumping is limited and/or taxed to stop salt water intrusion.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Further inland, pumping can be
stopped to control movement of
toxic plumes that destroy valuable aquifers: this is done in the
Bunker Hill aquifer under the Santa Ana River, threatened with
fouling by toxins from Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pumping is routinely stopped to
prevent 'export' of water from
lands overlying an aquifer: California calls that the 'correlative
rights' doctrine. It is not always well observed, and not often
well-advised, but very well established. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If that does not suffice to stop
overdraft, pumping is controlled
to prorate water among surface owners, and shorten pump lifts. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Also, pumping wells near streams
can be stopped to prevent the
indirect diversion of surface water. This happens on the alluvial
fans that are so common in the west. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A simple solution to half our
tractable water problems would be
a severance tax on water withdrawals. If you can regulate it you can
tax it. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A tax can be viewed as nothing
more than an economic price
charged by the owner of water (the state) for using its property.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If Chicago-School (and Rand
Corporation) economists were more
consistent in their ardor for the price system, and less consistent
in their anarchistic mistrust of legislatures, they would seize upon
this obvious application of the price system and boost it with all
the considerable influence they wield. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether one chooses taxation
regulation, we must control pumping
in some manner if any system of surface control is to work. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While California rations and
conserves surface water, landowners
in the arid San Joaquin Valley just punch more and more wells into
the aquifers and pump up free water the State keeps recharging at
high cost. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus they play out their destined
role in The Great Water
Treadmill: subsidized water supply followed by overdraft followed by
State rescue projects followed by new overdrafts, etc. ad bankruptcy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This treadmill got well started in
1913 when Los Angeles tapped
the Owens Valley waters to supply free water in the San Fernando
Valley. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The lands there were timely
pre-purchased by insiders, giving a
clue to the forces behind the premature seizures and diversion of
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The episode was dramatized in the
film Chinatown, so the scenario
is often now labelled 'the Chinatown syndrome' although the key names
like Mulholland, Otis and Chandler sound distinctly occidental. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just history; it is the
present and near future: the
Great Treadmill keeps turning. The Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California (MWD) now presides over our destinies. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The MWD presses for more water
sources, preaches domestic
conservation, imposes rationing on its old customers -- and annexes
new desert lands to water. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In similar fashion, Kern County
landowners keep irrigating desert
lands and overdrafting, while petitioning the Sacramento legislature
for 'emergency' aid.

Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital, however durable, also
obsolesces because it is subject to
continual competition from streams of new products.&nbsp; Intellectual
capital, however classic, is subject to endless competition from floods
of new ideas and discoveries.&nbsp; Land does not obsolesce from this
cause:
there is no new land, let alone modem, state-of-the-art land.&nbsp;
Both
land and capital are subject to demand-obsolescence from changes in
tastes and fashions, but overall the taste for land as a consumer good
rises as incomes and wealth grow.&nbsp; The writer has documented
elsewhere
how the land share of residential real estate value rises sharply with
its total value.' The land part of residential real estate is a
"superior good"; the building part is not.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It follows that the demand for
land arises over time with incomes, but
faster than incomes.&nbsp; For example the soaring demand for golf has
produced 150 golf courses in one California county (Riverside) alone,
preempting a good bit of the usable land and a huge share of this
natural desert's limited water resources.&nbsp; </span>The western
quarter of
Massachusetts, the Berkshires, with adjoining parts of Connecticut, New
York, and Vermont, has become one vast country estate for suburban New
Yorkers and retirees, and is priced high above its farm value.&nbsp;
Ski
resorts, hunting clubs, yacht harbors, spas, beach resorts, and such
uses increasingly outbid mere utilitarian uses for prime lands.&nbsp;
There
is also a high and rising technical multiplier of demand for land to
complement modem consumer capital.&nbsp; For example, the parking
demands
alone of 200 million private autos in the U.S.A. preempt an area as
large as Maryland and Delaware combined.&nbsp; Unlike most of Maryland
and
Delaware, the parking lots are mostly on high-valued land in cities.
Soaring demands and reuse values are thus the norm in an affluent
society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What can it mean to "consume" land, when it does not get used
up?&nbsp; It
can only mean to occupy or preempt a time-slot of space.&nbsp; That has
the
most profound implications for the meaning of "consumption" in economic
thinking, and "consumer taxation" in fiscal policy.&nbsp; Economists
have
neglected and papered over these matters almost completely.&nbsp; These
are
pursued in B-13 below. ... <a

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    In the seventeenth century, John Locke sought to balance the commons and
      private property. Like others of his era, he saw that private property
      doesn&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; it exists in relationship to a commons,
      vis-&agrave;-vis which there are takings and leavings. The rationale for
      private property is that it boosts economic production, but the commons
      has a rationale, too: it provides sustenance for all. Both sides must be
      respected.</p>
  <p>Locke believed that God gave the earth to &#8220;mankind in common,&#8221; but
    that private property is justified because it spurs humans to work. Whenever
    a person mixes his labor with nature, he &#8220;joins to it something that
    is his own, and thereby makes it his property.&#8221; But here Locke added
    an important proviso: &#8220;For this labor being the unquestionable property
    of the laborer,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;no man but he can have a right to
    what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good,
    left in common for others.&#8221; In other words, a person can acquire property,
    but there&#8217;s a limit to how much he or she can rightfully appropriate.
    That limit is set by two considerations: first, it should be no more than
    he can join his labor to, and second, it has to leave &#8220;enough and as
    good&#8221; in common for others.<strong> This was consistent with English
    common law at the time, which held, for example, that a riparian landowner
    could
    withdraw water for his own use, but couldn&#8217;t diminish the supply available
    to others.</strong></p>
  <p>Despite Locke&#8217;s quest for balance, the English commons didn&#8217;t
    last. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the movement to enclose
    and privatize it accelerated greatly. According to historian Karl Polanyi,
    this enclosure was the great transformation that launched the modern era.
    Local gentry, backed by Parliament, fenced off village lands and converted
    them to private holdings. Impoverished peasants then drifted to cities and
    became industrial workers. Landlords invested their agricultural profits
    in manufacturing, and modern times, economically speaking, began.</p>
