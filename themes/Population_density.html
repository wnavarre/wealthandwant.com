<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>,
    Chapter 8: Why a Land-Value Tax is Better than an Equal Tax on All Property</a> (in
    the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Book
    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. <strong>This is a value that does not arise until a community
      is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. </strong>Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land, are
      in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will
      the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage
      over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
      get its full reward, and capital its natural return. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

      the Railroad Will Bring Us</a> [Californians, and particularly San
      Franciscans]&nbsp; (1868)<a

 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But however this be, it is
certain that the tendency of the new era -- the more dense population
and more thorough development of the wealth of the State -- will be
to a reduction both of the rate of interest and the rate of wages,
particularly the latter. This tendency may not, probably will not, be
shown immediately; but it will be before long, and that powerfully,
unless balanced and counteracted by other influences which we are not
now considering, which do not yet appear, and which it is probable
will not appear for some time yet.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
truth is, that the completion of the railroad and the
consequent great increase of business and population, will not be a
benefit to all of us, but only to a portion.</span> As a general rule
(liable of course to exceptions) those who <span
 style="font-style: italic;">have</span> it will make
wealthier; for those who <span style="font-style: italic;">have not</span>,
it will make it more difficult to
get. Those who have lands, mines, established businesses, special
abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; those who have only their own labor will be
come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first, because it will
take more capital to buy land or to get into business; and second,
because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this capital will
be harder for them to obtain.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What, for instance, does the rise
in land mean? Several things,
but certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future
for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of
the State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a
dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In
other words, the settler who last year might have had at once a farm
of his own, must now either go to work on wages for some one else,
pay rent or buy on time; in either case being compelled to give to
the capitalist a large proportion of the earnings which, had he
arrived a year ago, he might have had all for of himself. And as
proprietorship is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable to
the poor, more are forced into the labor market to compete with each
other, and cut down the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division
of their joint production between labor and capital more in favor of
capital and less in favor of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so in San Francisco the rise
in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for
rent; means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies
courts, slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">San
Francisco has one great advantage -- there is probably a
larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
lots than in any other city of the United States.</span> The product of
the
rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the
great social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship
cannot be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the
princely domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">pueblo </span>was not appropriated
to furnishing free, or almost free,
homesteads to actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into
the hands of a few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been
taken up in time and in a proper spirit, this disposition might
easily have been secured, and the great city of the future would have
had a population bound to her by the strongest ties-a population
better, freer, more virtuous, independent and public spirited than
any great city the world has ever had.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To say that "Power is constantly
stealing from the many to the
few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends to
concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the
new era into which California is entering, its operations will be
more marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great
centralizer. It kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the
same way kills little businesses and builds up great ones. We have
had comparatively but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning
"very rich" has in these times. But the process is going on. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
great city that is to be will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts
and Spragues, and he who looks a few years ahead may even now read
their names as he passes along Montgomery, California or Front
streets.&nbsp;</span> With the protection which property gets in modern
times -- with stocks, bonds, burglar-proof safes and policemen; with
the
railroad and the telegraph, after a man gets a certain amount of money
it is plain sailing, and he need take no risks. Astor said that to
get his first thousand dollars was his toughest struggle; but when
one gets a million, if he has ordinary prudence, how much he will
have is only a question of life. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nor
can we rely on the absence of
laws of primogeniture and entail to dissipate these large fortunes so
menacing to the general weal. Any large fortune will, of course,
become dissipated in time, even in spite of laws of primogeniture and
entail; but every aggregation of wealth implies and necessitates
others, and so that the aggregations remain, it matters little in
what particular hands. </span>Stewart, in the natural course of
things, will
die before long, and being childless, his wealth will be dissipated,
or at least go out of the dry goods business. But will this avail the
smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing out? Not at all.
Some one else will step in, take his place in the trade, and run the
great money-making machine which he has organized, or some other
similar one. Stewart and other great houses have concentrated the
business, and
it will remain concentrated. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes
to the effects of this concentration of wealth. One millionaire
involves the little existence of just so many proletarians. It is the
great tree and the saplings over again. We need not look far from the
palace to find the hovel. When people can charter special steamboats
to take them to watering places, pay four thousand dollars for the
summer rental of a cottage, build marble stables for their horses,
and give dinner parties which cost by the thousand dollars a head, we
may know that there are poor girls on the streets pondering between
starvation and dishonor.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">When
liveries appear, look out for bare-footed children.</span> A few
liveries are now to be seen on our streets; we think their appearance
coincides in date with the establishment of the almshouse. They are
few, plain and modest now; they will grow more numerous and gaudy --
and then we will not wait long for the children -- their
corollaries.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But
there is another side: we are to become a great, populous,
wealthy community. And in such a community many good things are
possible that are not possible in a community such as ours has been.
</span>There have been artists, scholars, and men of special knowledge
and
ability among us, who could and some of whom have since won
distinction and wealth in older and larger cities, but who here could
only make a living by digging sand, peddling vegetables, or washing
dishes in restaurants. It will not be so in the San Francisco of the
future. We shall keep such men with us, and reward them, instead of
driving them away. We shall have our noble charities, great museums,
libraries and universities; a class of men who have leisure for
thought and culture; magnificent theatres and opera houses; parks and
pleasure gardens. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This crowding of people into
immense cities, this aggregation of
wealth into large lumps, this marshalling of men into big gangs under
the control of the great "captains of industry," does not tend to
foster personal independence -- the basis of all virtues -- nor will it
tend to preserve the characteristics which particularly have made
Californians proud of their State. ...<a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the limitation is not in
labour and not in capital, it must be
in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
Francisco? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go to that great city of
New York, where people are
crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. </span>Yet, why are
there
not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
which to build more houses. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Today one half of the area of New
York City is unbuilt
upon &#8212; is absolutely unused. When there is such a pressure, why
don't people go to these vacant lots and build there? Because though
unused, the land is owned; because, speculating upon the future
growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.
What you see in New York, you may see everywhere. Come into the
coalfields of Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands
and thousands of miners unable to work, either locked out by their
employers, or striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages
being cut down a little more.&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <p>... So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
  <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
      The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my
      kids are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready
      to buy.</p>
  <p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
      matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
      kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that
    house will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot;</p>
  <p>Such data are dismaying, but perspective helps. &quot;In Britain,&quot; the

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Alfred Gobar, savvy real estate
consultant from Placentia, has
recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
miles). That would be at a density of 3625 people per square mile, or
5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He is not being stingy with land,
at 3625 persons per square mile.
The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
mile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On Manhattan's upper East Side
they pile up at over 100,000 per
square mile. They do not crowd like this out of desperation, either.
You may think of rats in cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
they actually like it there!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take 10,000 per square mile as a
reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "floating value."&nbsp;<strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, let us imagine, is <b>an unbounded savannah</b>, stretching off in
    unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires
    of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle
    he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
    wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely
    no choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out
    with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
    anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
    rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
    at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
    him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
    would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
    material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
    any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
    cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
    a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
    short, a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
    schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such
    things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on
    hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
    making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do
    so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger
    may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances,
    though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him
    to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy
    only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
    boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
    by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
    there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
    that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
    by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
    and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
    two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
      the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
      quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler
      under the Homestead Act. </font><br>
  </div>
  Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
  there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
  are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
  state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
  a logrolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years.
  When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill,
  and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster,
  and the children of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching
  would have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
  send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need
  for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our
  settler can have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
  cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a
  postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the
  world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little
  church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state
  were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the intellectual
  nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power
  of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
  open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others
  to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees,
  and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered
  and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the strain,
  and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire
  and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands
  human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer
  to open up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
  times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and
  power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John
  Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
  talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the
  prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of
  fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
  and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
  circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
  sandy deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised
  Joseph from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the
  Alps with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music
  that thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
  of Kubla Khan.
    <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
      you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
      you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
      is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
      need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
      you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
      of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
      potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
      and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
      we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
      all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
      increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
      things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
      it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
      yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
      far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
      upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
      this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
      stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
      not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
      the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
      land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
      center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
      of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
      will be raised.</p>
    <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
      economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
      of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
      the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
      it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
      into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
      With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
      land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
      expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
      of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
      branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
      especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
      in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
      go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
      and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
      the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
      of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
      distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
      the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
      power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
      acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
      had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
      fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
      transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
      and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
      themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
      has given the land.</p>
    <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
      to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
      into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
      still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
      the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
      becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
      are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
      friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
      that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
      one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
      set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
      have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
      is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
      into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
      of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
      of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
      museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
      all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
      actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
      is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
    <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
      of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
      over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
      tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
      eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
      engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
      of horses. </p>
    <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
        other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
        focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
        of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
        attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
        fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
        the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
        productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
        has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another <a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip
        Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
        from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
        are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
        than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
        more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
        streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
        finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
        Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
        same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
        it had no value at all.</p>
    <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
      in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
      him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
      difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
      rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
      compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
      which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
      valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
      not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
      utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
    <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
      gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
      attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
      of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
      makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
      rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
      of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
    <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
        as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
        heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
        brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
        fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
        fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
        Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
        and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
        be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
        will have greatly increased.</p>
    <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If
      the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch
      and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. <b><i>And

<blockquote>
  <p>    DOES not the fact that all of the things which furnish man's subsistence
      have the power to multiply many fold &#8212; some of them many thousand
      fold, and some of them many million or even billion fold &#8212; while
      he is only doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings increase to
      the full extent of their reproductive power, the increase of population
      can never exceed subsistence? This is clear when it is remembered that
      though in the vegetable and animal kingdoms each species, by virtue of
      its reproductive power, naturally and necessarily presses against the conditions
      which limit its further increase, yet these conditions are nowhere fixed
      and final. No species reaches the ultimate limit of soil, water, air, and
      sunshine; but the actual limit of each is in the existence of other species,
      its rivals, its enemies, or its food. Thus the conditions which limit the
      existence of such of these species as afford him subsistence man can extend
      (in some cases his mere appearance will extend them), and thus the reproductive
      forces of the species which supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves
      against their former limit, start forward in his service at a pace which
      his powers of increase cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds
      will increase: if he but trap foxes the wild rabbits will multiply; the
      bumble bee moves with the pioneer, and on the organic matter with which
      man's presence fills the rivers, fishes feed. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

  <p>IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North American
    continent, there would now be no more bears than in the time of Columbus,
    and possibly fewer, for bear food would not have been increased nor the conditions
    of bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the reverse.
    But within the limits of the United States alone, there are now forty-five
    millions of men where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet
    there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five
    millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. It is not the
    increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of
    men that has brought about the increase of food. There is more food, simply

    hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the
    limits in which we have any reason to suppose increase would still go on,

      Two Modes </span><br>
        <br>
ALL increase in the productive power of man over that with which nature endows
the individual comes from the co-operation of individuals. But there are two
ways in which this co-operation may take place. 1. By the combination of effort.
In this way individuals may accomplish what exceeds the full power of the individual.
2. By the separation of effort. In this way the individual may accomplish for
more than one what does not require the full power of the individual. . . . To
illustrate: The first way of co-operation, the combination of labor, enables
a number of men to remove a rock or to raise a log that would be too heavy for
them separately. In this way men conjoin themselves, as it were, into one stronger
man. Or, to take an example so common in the early days of American settlement
that "log-rolling" has become a term for legislative combination: Tom, Dick,
Harry and Jim are building near each other their rude houses in the clearings.
Each hews his own trees, but the logs are too heavy for one man to get into place.
So the four unite their efforts, first rolling one man's logs into place and
then another's, until, the logs of all four having been placed, the result is
the same as if each had been enabled to concentrate into one time the force he
could exert in four different times. . . . But, while great advantages result
from the ability of individuals, by the combination of labor to concentrate themselves,
as it were, into one larger man, there are other times and other things in which
an individual could accomplish more if he could divide himself, as it were, into
a number of smaller men. . . . What the division of labor does, is to permit
men, as it were, so to divide themselves, thus enormously increasing their total
effectiveness. To illustrate from the example used before: While at times Tom,
Dick, Harry and Jim might each wish to move logs, at other times they might each
need to get something from a village distant two days' journey. To satisfy this
need individually would thus require two days' effort on the part of each. But
if Tom alone goes, performing the errands for all, and the others each do half
a days' work for him, the result is that all get at the expense of half a day's
effort on the part of each what otherwise would have required two days' effort. &#8212; <em>The

          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Co-operation &#8212; its Two Kinds </span><br>
          <br>
WE have seen that there are two ways or modes in which co-operation increases
productive power. If we ask how co-operation is itself brought about, we see
that there is in this also a distinction, and that co-operation is of two essentially
different kinds. . .. There is one kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were,
from without, which results from the conscious direction of a controlling will
to a definite end. This we may call directed or conscious co-operation. There
is another kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were, from within, which results
from a correlation in the actions of independent wills, each seeking but its
own immediate purpose, and careless, if not indeed ignorant, of the general result.
This we may call spontaneous or unconscious co-operation. The movement of a great
army is a good type of co-operation of the one kind. Here the actions of many
individuals are subordinated to, and directed by, one conscious will, they becoming,
as it were, its body and executing its thought. The providing of a great city
with all the manifold things which are constantly needed by its inhabitants is
a good type of co-operation of the other kind. This kind of co-operation is far
wider, far finer, far more strongly and delicately organized, than the kind of
co-operation involved in the movements of an army, yet it is brought about not
by subordination to the direction of one conscious will, which knows the general
result at which it aims, but by the correlation of actions originating in many
independent wills, each aiming at its own small purpose without care for, or
thought of; the general result. The one kind of co-operation seems to have its
analogue in those related movements of our body which we are able consciously
to direct. The other kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue in the correlation
of the innumerable movement, of which we are unconscious, that maintain the bodily
frame &#8212; motions which in their complexity, delicacy and precision far transcend
our powers of conscious direction, yet by whose perfect adjustment to each other
and to the purpose of the whole, that co-operation of part and function, that
makes up the human body and keeps it in life and vigor, is brought about and
supported. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em>&nbsp;&#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe310.html">unabridged:

        <br>
To attempt to apply that kind of co-operation which requires direction from without
to the work proper for that kind of co-operation which requires direction from
within, is like asking the carpenter who can build a chicken-house to build a
chicken also. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe310.html">unabridged:
