      (1889 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Has it come?
Let this Christian
city of Glasgow answer &#8212; Glasgow, that was to &#8220;Flourish by
the preaching of the word&#8221;. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Day after
day, Sunday after
Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone
up; and today, in this so-called Christian city of Glasgow, 125,000
human beings &#8212; so your medical officer says &#8212; 125,000
children of God are living whole families in a single room.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Better to me, higher to me, is
the atheist, who says there is no

creatures &#8212; [at this point a child was heard crying]
&#8212; don&#8217;t take the little thing out &#8212; that millions and

on both sides of the Atlantic, where little children are dying every
day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because having come into this
world &#8212; those children of God, with His fiat, by His decree
&#8212; they find that there is not space on the earth sufficient for

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
truth is, that the completion of
the railroad and the consequent great increase of business and
population, will not be a benefit to all of us, but only to a portion</span>.
As a general rule (liable of course to exceptions) those who have it
will make wealthier; for those who have not, it will make it more
difficult to get. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those who have lands, mines, established businesses,
special
abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>those who have only their own labor will be come poorer,
and find it harder to get ahead -- 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>
    <li><small>first, because it will take more capital to buy land or
to get into business; and 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>second, because as competition reduces the wages of
labor, this capital will be harder for them to obtain.</small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What,
for instance, does the rise in
land mean? Several things, but certainly and prominently this: that it
will be harder in future for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead
lot.</span> In some sections of the State, land which twelve months ago
could have been had for a dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less
than fifteen dollars. In other words, the settler who last year might
have had at once a farm of his own, must now either go to work on wages
for some one else, pay rent or buy on time; in either case being
compelled to give to the capitalist a large proportion of the earnings
which, had he arrived a year ago, he might have had all for of himself.
And as proprietorship is thus
rendered more difficult and less profitable to the poor, more are
forced into the labor market to compete with each other, and cut down
the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division of their joint
production between labor and capital more in favor of capital and less
in favor of labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">And so in San Francisco the
rise in building lots means, that it will
be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and if he
has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for rent; means
a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies courts, slums,
tenement-houses, squalor and vice.&nbsp; </span>...<a

Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one
man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we
have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material
progress goes on. This is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not
realize is extracting from the masses in every civilized country the
fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more
hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed; that is
bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...You may see the same thing
all over this country. See how
injuriously in the agricultural districts this thing of private
property in land affects the roads and the distances between the
people. <b>A man does not take what land he wants, what he can use,
but he takes all he can get, and the consequence is that his next
neighbour has to go further along, people are separated from each
other further than they ought to be, to the increased difficulty of
production, to the loss of neighbourhood and companionship. They have
more roads to maintain than they can decently maintain; they must do
more work to get the same result, and life is in every way harder and
drearier. </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When you come to the cities it is
just the other way. In the
country the people are too much scattered; in the great cities they
are too crowded. Go to a city like New York and there they are jammed
together like sardines in a box, living family upon family, one above
the other. It is an unnatural and unwholesome life. How can you have
anything like a home in a tenement room, or two or three rooms? How
can children be brought up healthily with no place to play? Two or
three weeks ago I read of a New York judge who fined two little boys
five dollars for playing hop-scotch on the street&#8212;where else
could they play? Private property in land had robbed them of all
place to play. Even a temperance man, who had investigated the
subject, said that in his opinion the gin palaces of London were a
positive good in this, that they enabled the people whose abodes were
dark and squalid rooms to see a little brightness and thus prevent
them from going wholly mad. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What is the reason for this
overcrowding of cities? There is
no natural reason. Take New York, one half its area is not built
upon. Why, then, must people crowd together as they do there? Simply
because of private ownership of land. There is plenty of room to
build houses and plenty, of people who want to build houses, but
before anybody can build a house a blackmail price must be paid to
some dog in the manger. It costs in many cases more to get vacant
ground upon which to build a house than it does to build the house.
And then what happens to the man who pays this blackmail and builds a
house? Down comes the tax-gatherer and fines him for building the
house. </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is so all over the United
States &#8212; the men who improve,
the men who turn the prairie into farms and the desert into gardens,
the men who beautify your cities, are taxed and fined for having done
these things. Now, nothing is clearer than that the people of New
York want more houses; and I think that even here in Burlington you
could get along with more houses. Why, then, should you fine a man
who builds one?<b> Look all over this country &#8212; the bulk of the
taxation rests upon the improver; the man who puts up a building, or
establishes a factory, or cultivates a farm he is taxed for it; and
not merely taxed for it, but I think in nine cases out of ten the
land which he uses, the bare land, is taxed more than the adjoining
lot or the adjoining 160 acres that some speculator is holding as a
mere dog in the manger, not using it himself and not allowing anybody
else to use it.&nbsp; </b>...<a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html"> <span

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p><strong>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding
      that is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. </strong>They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. <strong>These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting
    of poverty.</strong>    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
  <p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the
    community. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>Winston Churchill: <a href="../docs/Churchill_LPCP.html">Land Price as
  a Cause of Poverty</a> (1909 speech in Parliament)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... I do not think the Leader of
the Opposition could have chosen a
more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of
that great community for land was for not more than forty acres a
year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does
that really represent the complete economic and natural demand for
the amount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I
will admit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford
to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room
tenements; and we are told that the utmost land those people can
absorb economically and naturally is forty acres a year.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the explanation? Because
the population is congested in
the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
congested within the city. That is the position which we are
complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
hitherto dominated civilised society.</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>But
when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this
unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sometimes it is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the widow</span>.
But that personality has been used to
exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,
overtime of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so
soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
life should become larger than it is at present.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the position disclosed
by the argument? On the one hand,
we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
spreads and who would not really be in the least injured. </small><small>...

People's Land</a>
&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned
increment
reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
follow the process a little further. The population of the
city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale -- that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact, you may say that the
unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
not to the service but to the disservice done. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax
on capital value of undeveloped land</span>&nbsp; But there is another
proposal concerning land values which is not less
important. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or
suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of the land monopolist
as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not take that view of
the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dog-in-the-manger</span>
game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
-- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with
regard to the land, and its effects will be, 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>first, to raise an expanding revenue for the needs of the
State; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>secondly, half the proceeds of this tax, as well as of the
other
land taxes, will go to the municipalities and local authorities
generally to relieve rates; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>thirdly,<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> the effect
will be, as we believe, to bring land into the market, and thus
somewhat cheapen the price at which land is obtainable for every
object, public and private, and by so doing we shall liberate new
springs of enterprise and industry, we shall stimulate building,
relieve overcrowding, and promote employment.</span></small><small>... <a

<p>Robert G. Ingersoll: <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A
Lay Sermon</a> (1886)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
any land that he does not use.
Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
it. And why? Don't you know that if people could bottle the air, they
would? Don't you know that there would be an American Air-bottling
Association? And don't you know that they would allow thousands and
millions to die for want of breath, if they could not pay for air? I am
not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a
few landlords and millions of tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tenement house is the enemy of modesty, the enemy of virtue,
the
enemy of patriotism. Home is where the virtues grow. I would like to
see the law so that every home, to a small amount, should be free not
only from sale for debts, but should be absolutely free from taxation,
so that every man could have a home. Then we will have a nation of
patriots.&nbsp; </small><small>...<a

William F. Buckley, Jr.: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">Home
Dear Home</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
  <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
      The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my
      kids are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready
      to buy.</p>
  <p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
      matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
      kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that
    house will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot;</p>
  <p>Such data are dismaying, but perspective helps. &quot;In Britain,&quot; the
    builder explains, &quot;you pay seven times your annual income for a home;
    in the U.S. you pay three and a half.&quot; The Brits get 330 square feet per
    person in their homes; Americans, 750 square feet. But choice parts of the
    United States face &quot;build-out.&quot; Consider New Jersey. It currently
    averages 1,165 people per square mile -- denser than India (914) and Japan
    (835).</p>
  <p>And we confront, finally and inevitably, the question: What is to be done
    about it?</p>
  <p>Almost without exception, housing specialists concur, high home prices are
    owing to zoning. Twenty years ago, in many quarters of the country, one year
    would go by before the political authority would permit a developer to begin
    housing construction. In New Jersey, that interval now approaches eight years.
    Delays of that kind have the effect of shrinking the amount of land on which
    houses can be constructed. We get the inflated costs so familiar. &quot;(Some
    authorities) used sample prices from 25 areas to show that the cost of housing
    in a metropolitan area appears to be in direct correlation to its degree of
    zoning ordinances,&quot; Gertner writes.</p>
  <p>This is a politically remote source of trouble. People who have to wait for
    a zoning agency to change its conventions, regulations, traditions and idiosyncrasies
    will be very old before they acquire a new home.</p>
  <p> Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
    attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
    factor of land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot. ...<a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read
