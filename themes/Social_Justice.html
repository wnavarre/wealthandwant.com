Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Social
Justice of Site Value Rating</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In primitive societies, land is
generally regarded as not ownable.
No one made the land, so how can anyone own it? Ownership generally
originates in conquest. In England, titles to land originated in the
claim of William the Conqueror to own all the land because he was
king. He granted to dukes, earls, etc. the right to collect rent from
designated territories in exchange for their promises to fulfill
various obligations to him. In the seventeenth century the nobility
succeeded in removing all of their obligations to the crown, but they
retained their rights to land. A substantial part of the great
inequality in wealth in the United Kingdom can be traced to ancient
patents of nobility that granted rights to collect rent. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One highly visible consequence of
allowing land rents to be
privately appropriated is that young people find it nearly impossible
to buy houses. The price of a "house," in the Southeast of Britain at
least, is primarily the price of land. If the rent of land were
collected publicly, the price of land would be inconsequential, and
the price of a house would be the cost of the materials and labour
that went into building it. It should be recognized that if the site
value of land were taxed, the payment of such taxes would make it
more expensive to live in large cities than in small towns, but young
people would be better able to afford it because other taxes would be
reduced, and the mortgages to which people would need to commit
themselves would not be nearly as great.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The general principle
involved in all of these examples is that whenever a government
grants a right to some and not to others, those who are granted such
rights should pay annually, to the government, the value of those
rights, measured by what others who do not have them would be willing
to pay to have them.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Private appropriation of rent and
other privileges makes it
necessary for governments to look elsewhere for revenue, with the
consequence that even persons with very low incomes are required to
turn over part of what little they earn to the state. In justice we
ought to allow everyone, but especially those whose earnings are
lowest, to allocate what they produce as they themselves choose.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The three sources of land
rent, the gift of nature, public
services and community development, lead logically to the justice of
three distinct taxes on land.</b>&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>One activity that is sometimes thought to be unfairly
affected
by site value rating is farming. </b>To a substantial extent, this
concern reflects a misperception of the relation between urban and
rural rents. The vast preponderance of land rents are urban. Also, it
is important to remember that the basis of site value rating is the
unimproved value of land. Much of what farmers do increases the value
of land in ways less obvious than buildings. Site value rating of
agricultural land should be applied on the basis of what the rental
value of the land would be in a completely overgrown condition.&nbsp;<strong>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HENRY
GEORGE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">
"Solving the land question means the solving of all social questions&#8230;
Possession of land by people who do not use it is immoral - just like
the possession of slaves."</span> - Leo Tolstoy, (1828 - 1910)
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>It was the power of the passion of George which led many of his
supporters to believe he was somehow inspired and, in fact, George
himself related an amazing inner experience he had when finishing his
classic <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE RELIGION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But you don't have to be at all religious to catch on to
Geonomics, and
we should stress that there's certainly no dogma in it, religious or
economic. But, while we all inevitably delve into economic theory at
one stage or another, what really puts fire into our bellies and keeps
us going in the face of so many obstacles is the whole issue of social
justice. It was this concern that fueled George's passionate mission
more than anything else, and it rubs off on many of those who
understand the fundamental economic principles he elucidated.</small><br>
<br>
<small>If you've read this far, you don't need to be told of the
increasing
disparities of wealth on this planet, both in developing and so-called
developed nations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's not
the reality of social injustice that motivates most Georgists, but
rather the conviction that it's all so unnecessary! </span>Here's a
very brief recap on why:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speculators can sit on
large parcels of land and wait for the community to build up its value.</span>
Land Value Taxation (LVT) would prevent speculation, induce the land to
be put to its best possible use, and instead divert the increased land
value to the community coffers. Valuable natural resources, which often
fall into private hands, would again become part of the common wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current taxation is
largely legalised robbery.</span>
But the rich, who often made their fortunes by misappropriating what
should be the community's economic rent, have the means to set up tax
shelters. LVT, in sharp contrast, is impossible to evade.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">At the moment, whoever is
lucky
(or powerful) enough to own land earns greater and greater rent while
the base earnings are forced down as population growth pushes the point
of marginal land out further and further.</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our tax system rewards
sloth and speculation while punishing industry, thrift, savings and
honesty.</span>
Many public works, infrastructure and beautification projects are
presently unaffordable because their value ends up in landowners'
pockets rather than being recycled back to the community through LVT.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land monopoly is the
"mother of all monopolies". </span>Those without land still need it,
and have to work on the terms of those who have laid their hands on it
first.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Involuntary unemployment
is totally unnecessary.</span>
There are so many productive things that need to be done by those who
presently are prevented from doing them. Additionally, many wage
earners have their bargaining power and earning potential reduced by
the threat of unemployment.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the late 19th and
early 20th
century, a number of the most influential American plutocrats applied
their considerable resources to stifle the work (and especially the
ideas) of Henry George, and bankrolled the installation of neoclassical
economics.</span> In academic and professional circles today there's
nothing much conspiratorial - only ignorance and an unwillingness to
admit that their "dismal science" has consistently failed to deliver
any viable alternative. George's economic analysis has never been
seriously or scientifically challenged, let alone undermined - and
still holds as true today as it did one hundred years ago.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The principles of our
social
justice proposals are radical and yet elegant: You don't get taxed on
what you earn. What you rightly owe to society is based on what society
does for you </span>- in other words, on the physical and social
infrastructure available to you. Nothing more, nothing less.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Third World, where
land ownership is often concentrated in the hands of a few families,
things are worse.</span>
Vast tracts of land remain unused because, without the pressure of LVT
forcing site holders to turn their sites to productive use in order to
cover the cost of the LVT, the landowning families can afford to wait
until the desperately poor work on the terms dictated to them.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We'll have our
birthrights restored! Geonomics effectively makes us co-owners of all
the Global Commons.</span>
And land will be effectively free of a purchase price, as land price
currently is the "capitalisation" of annual land values into private
pockets. The great burden facing all entrants to this planet - having
to save huge amounts to pay for what should be our inheritance - will
no longer exist!</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the reader may have
concluded, it is not possible to stick purely to
social justice issues, keeping the economics out of it. The two issues
are inextricably linked, so that understanding the solution to social
injustice necessarily entails some more-than-basic knowledge of
economics.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE REAL THING'S A TURN-ON!</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But economics, to many people, seems so dry, money-minded and
mathematical as to be a real turn-off. Yet these same people will often
rail against injustice. Maybe it's because the problem is obvious but
the solution is hard to figure out. It is the same with a number of
environmental activists - they won't hesitate to stand in front of a
bulldozer, but much less often will they attempt to understand the
underlying economics that has led to the pillaging of the Global
Commons in the first place.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It's rather analogous to the tale of the guy who, blind drunk at
night,
is looking for his keys under a lamp post. A passer-by asks, "Are you
sure you lost them here?" The drunk slurs a reply, "No - I lost them in
the alley over the road, but there's no light there." The drunk is the
environmental activist (or an ordinary citizen angered by injustice),
his keys are the solution, the area under the street light is the
easy-but-ineffectual answer (like hugging a tree or raising taxes on
the rich), but the keys really lie in the difficult area of economics.

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">II. The problem of sprawl</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While taxes on labour
and
capital act as a deterrent to production and employment, the unique
qualities of land are such that a tax on land values encourages land to
be put to its optimal use. Simply put, land holders cannot afford to
hold land unused or underused, for they are compelled to pay the full
LVT whether they use this scarce resource or not. </span>The resulting
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compact cityscape</span>
would consume far less resources (in terms of land, infrastructure and
ongoing energy costs) and would be more amenable to the provision of
public transport, walking and riding.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Note that advocates of LVT, often nowadays called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Geoists</span>,
call for the full collection of the LVT and not the partial and
misapplied (with all manner of exemptions and thresholds) forms
collected by some local, state and federal governments in Australia and
elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When the land occupier is
repaying his/her full dues (which is only just, as they represent the
value of the amenities of the land), then land will have no market
price. </span>The improvements on the land (buildings etc.) retain
their market value as they are not being taxed, so production is not
penalised or discouraged. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The social
justice implications of having land with no market price (i.e. all
humanity having their very birthright) are profound, but are again
outside the domain of this paper.</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> ...<br>
<br>
</span>LVT and its 19th-century champion, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Henry
George</a>,
achieved huge acclaim before being buried by the "purpose-built" body
of neoclassical economics financed largely by rent-seeking American
plutocrats.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small>
In one form or another, Henry George's writings on the need to tax land
values was preceded or endorsed by various biblical prophets, and by
Carlyle, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Churchill</a>, Einstein, Franklin, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
Huxley</a>, Jefferson,
Lincoln, Locke, J.S. Mill, Paine, Penn, Rousseau, Bertrand Russell,
Adam Smith, Spencer, Spinoza, Sun Yat Sen, James Tobin, Tolstoy, <a href="../auth/Twain.html">Twain</a>,
Voltaire, Winstanley, Frank Lloyd Wright and many more.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19]</span></small>
Just how this wisdom has been lost sight of is a long - too long for
this paper - and tragic story.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here, for this conference, is the quirk - <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">environmental
considerations played almost no part in the compelling endorsements
lavished on LVT! The main bill, then and now, is its powerful
explanation of the great causes of social injustice, with the second
billing going to an exposure of a whole range of economic
inefficiencies and deadweight losses of our present economic system,
which should more accurately be termed land-monopoly capitalism. </span></small><small>Support
acts include libertarian ideals (non-intrusive tax systems),
effective Third World Aid, an end to tax evasion, contributions to
world peace, and an end to boom &amp; bust cycles.</small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
<br>
The appeal of LVT to some others is more its philosophical basis and
how its implementation must turn the economy the right way up, such
that the cause of the "madness" (because completely unnecessary) of
involuntary unemployment is eliminated, which of necessity then leads
to the range of benefits just mentioned.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This is
not a meandering departure from the subject of this conference.
No significant, effectual solutions can be made to our environment if
the all-embracing economic system is only nibbled at, piecemeal, from
the angle of taxation alone.</span><br>
<br>
LVT is not a mere taxation solution, but an integrated economic
solution, impacting on land management and cutting at the heart of
privilege and injustice. Yes, environmental tax reformers must indeed
address the looting of undervalued natural resources driven by
bourgeois habits of overconsumption. Let us not, however, overlook the
destruction resulting from short-term perspectives driven by poverty
and desperation. LVT deals with both worlds.

superior bargaining power </b>Labor starves, in contests of endurance;
land endures.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>A
landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she can earn

Dying City</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small>With
all that talk of capital and efficiency, remember that we
began with a quest for justice in sharing rent surplus. Justice and
efficiency are not at odds; we can have both. The trade-off expounded
by many economists is to enervate us so we won't do anything. Yet we
have shown not just that we can have both, but more; we cannot have
either without the other. If we do not share rents in the efficient
Georgist manner, social and political pressures will cause
inefficient sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is what economic policy can
do. The basic impulses, however,
the striving for justice and brotherhood, and the sense of personal
ethics, come from within, and from family, community, schools, and
religion. So does the sense of workmanship, the striving for
excellence without which no system works. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are city councilpersons who
can corrupt the best system ever
blueprinted. The Georgist program may even help to straighten them
out. Lincoln Steffens taught us that the villain in Eden was neither
Eve nor the serpent, but the apple! The apples of discord that
corrupt city councils are unearned increments to land value, which
they create or deny with every decision on extending sewers or
changing zoning. Georgist tax dehydrates those apples by attaching
higher tax to each unearned increment. </small><small><a

<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
</span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive:<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp; <strong>...</strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small></p>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: ... <br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders.<strong> ... </strong><br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either.<strong> ... </strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
<p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
of the Gospels.</small> <small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html"><span

<small>X. Conclusion </small><br>
<small>How would the world look if its political institutions were
shaped by the conception of social justice advanced by Henry
George?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was one of the most
famous reformers of the late 19th
century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b>, his ideas have inspired people working for
economic and social reform all around the world. He is most famous
for proposing the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the
value of land. But I will argue that the single tax on land was not
George's most important contribution, and that the power of his
thinking can be best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social
justice that he used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>First I will argue that George's
theory of social justice provides
the dramatic climax as well as the logical foundation of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, I will discuss the functions
of a theory of justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then I will address the question
of what George's theory of social
justice implies for relations among nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Finally, I will ask what
constitutes justice within nations, in a
world where relations among nations are governed by George's theory
of social justice.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.
Social Justice as the Climax and Logical Foundation of Progress and
Poverty</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While George wrote a number of
books -- the precise number depends
on how you count -- the most powerful statement of his ideas is
<b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>, a volume that he divided into ten
Books.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The work is in part a restatement of economic theory,
(Books I, III and IV),</small></li>
  <li><small>part an examination of the causes of and proposed cures
for persistent widespread poverty (Books II, V, and VI),</small></li>
  <li><small>part a brief for curing poverty and the unacceptable
distribution of wealth by eliminating all taxes except a tax on the
value of land (Books VII, VIII and IX), and</small></li>
  <li><small>part a theory of human progress (Book X).</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I believe that the most
significant lasting impact of Progress and
Poverty will come from the conception of justice in Chapter 1 of Book
VII, a chapter titled "<b>The Injustice of Private Property in
Land</b>." From a dramatic perspective, this chapter is the cenptral
component of the climax of the work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The climax begins with the second
of the two chapters of Book VI.
In the first chapter of Book VI, George analyzes six different
proposed remedies for persistent poverty and explains why they are
inadequate. In the second chapter, which consists of just three
pages, he asserts that the only effective remedy for the relief of
poverty and the unacceptable distribution of wealth is to "<b>make
land common propert</b>y."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's choice of words here may
have been unnecessarily
inflammatory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When people see this phrase, they
generally presume that George
was proposing public ownership of land. In fact he rejected public
ownership of land. What he actually meant was that we must recognize
that land is everyone's common heritage, and we must develop
institutions that reflect this. In any case, he recognized that his
assertion would sound outrageous to many of his readers, and he
promises to defend it:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote><small><i>The laws of the universe are harmonious. And if
the remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be
consistent with justice; it must be practical of application; it must
accord with the tendencies of social development and must harmonize
with other reforms.</i> </small>
    <p><small><i>All this I propose to show.</i></small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Accordingly, Book VII is concerned
with the justice of making land
common property, Book VIII deals with the method and practicality of
making land common property -- not by public ownership of land, but
by abolishing other taxes and financing government by public
collection of the rent of land, and Book IX explores economic
consequences of this remedy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The first chapter of Book VII thus
plays the crucial role of
overcoming the reader's inclination toward knee-jerk rejection of
George's startling idea. And George is prepared with a theory of
justice in powerful language:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>What constitutes the
rightful basis of property? What is it that enables a man justly to say
of a thing, "It is mine!" From what springs the sentiment which
acknowledges his exclusive right against all the world? Is it not,
primarily, the right of a man to himself, to the use of his own powers,
to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own exertions? Is it not this
individual right, which springs from and is testified to by the natural
facts of individual organization</i> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><font
 style="font-style: italic;" size="+2"><small><small>--</small></small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic;">the fact that each particular pair of
hands obey a particular
brain and are related to a particular stomach; the fact that each man
is a definite, coherent, independent whole</span><font
 style="font-style: italic;" size="+2"><small><small><small>--</small></small></small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic;">which alone justifies individual
ownership? As a
man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete form
belongs to him. </span>  </small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George then argues that if
ownership is derived from
labor, then no one can own land, since no one produced it:
</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>This right of
ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility of any other
right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the produce of
his own labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of
someone else from whom the right has passed to him. If production give
to the producer the right to exclusive possession and enjoyment, there
can rightfully be no exclusive possession and enjoyment of anything not
the production of labor, and the recognition of private property in
land is a wrong.</i></small></blockquote>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 80px;"><small>If we are all
here by the equal permission of the creator, we are
all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty<font size="+1"><small><b> -- </b></small></font>with an equal
right to
the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every
human being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance
in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There
is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth
no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive ownership in
land. If all existing men were to unite to grant away their equal
rights, they could not grant away the right of those who follow
them.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To summarize George's rights-based
theory of justice: Each person
has an exclusive right to his or her productive powers. We understand
this intuitively, and on this basis accept the idea that people own
what they produce. But if this is what ownership means, then no one
can claim to own land, since no one produced it. People do have
rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers, which are
here for our use, but the rights of each person are limited by the
equal rights of all other persons.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A careful analyst might object
that there are some logical gaps in
George's theory of justice. Logically, a right of ownership of things
based on the right of each person to his or her productive powers
does not preclude a right of ownership of natural opportunities on
some other basis. We could mean by ownership only those rights that
are derived from the right of each person to his or her productive
powers, but we could also mean something broader and more
complex.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The easiest way to repair this gap
in George's theory is to
specify that rather than having just one axiom, that each person has
a right to his or her productive powers, he actually has two, the
second one being that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A second logical gap occurs when
George asserts that because
people have rights to their productive powers, they own what they
produce. This would follow only if they also had rights to the
natural opportunities that they appropriate in the process of
production. It is possible that the natural resources component of
what a person produces is more than his share, considering the equal
rights of everyone to all that nature offers. This caveat can be
conceded without jeopardizing the two axioms, that each person has an
exclusive right to his or her productive powers, and all persons have
equal rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This pair of axioms is the logical
starting point of George's
ideas. His proposal for the abolition of all taxes except a tax on
land is a consequence that follows from them. Coercive taxes on the
act of producing or on income from productive effort are unjust
because people have rights to their productive powers. On the other
hand, taxes on the rental value that land would have if it were not
improved are not unjust, since this value is not produced by human
effort. Support of government spending from this source is a
convenient way of giving expression to the equal rights of all to
natural opportunities.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>V. Differences in
Ability and in Wealth</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a nation appropriates
only its share of natural
opportunities but is richer than other nations because its citizens
are, on average, more highly talented or harder working than the
citizens of other nations. Does justice require the richer nation to
compensate the others? By Henry George's theory of social justice,
definitely not! Each person has an exclusive right to his or her
productive powers. Therefore the nation as a whole has a right to the
product of its citizens' talents, no matter how greatly this product
exceeds that of the citizens of other nations. The citizens of a rich
nation may feel compassion for those who are poorer than themselves,
and therefore contribute to poor nations as a matter of charity, but
justice does not compel them to do so.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What about a greater income that
arise from greater wealth? This
requires more elaborate analysis. When greater wealth is the result
of greater saving from the product of talent or from the product of a
nation's share of natural opportunities, then a nation with greater
wealth is fully entitled to the greater income that comes from it.
However, when greater wealth is the result of a history of theft or
of unjustifiably large appropriations from the natural opportunities
that are everyone's common heritage, then the nation that possesses
that wealth cannot rightly claim either the income from the wealth or
the wealth itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To achieve justice, the wrongful
appropriations must be rectified.
The unjustly acquired wealth must be restored from those from whom it
was taken, or if that is not possible, shared among all nations. To
the extent that persons who are still alive received past income from
this wealth, that income must be disgorged.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When George addressed this issue
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>, he
suggested that all such past misappropriations be forgiven, that the
generation whom he addressed be content to receive their shares of
future rent. But the desirability of such a policy is a matter that the
dispossessed of any era must decide for themselves. Justice does not
require them to forego such rectification. <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Only if we have a standard of
justice that is independent of
history can we expect to end such actions. Henry George's theory of
economic justice -- that every persons his a right to his or her
productive powers, and that all persons have equal rights to all
natural opportunities -- provides a simple formula around which
opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can coalesce. This may
seem hopelessly optimistic. But no other theory that I have seen has
anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this theory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The theory needs a simple name.
I suggest calling this theory,
this perspective on social justice the Geoliberal perspective</b>.
Liberal for its commitment to individual liberty. Geo- for its
attention to land, for its planetary perspective, and for its
reliance on the ideas of George. If you like these ideas, I invite
you call yourself a geoliberal. I invite you to help me work out its
implications, to explain geoliberalism to others, and develop a
public dialogue about its value and implications. As Henry George
said, "Until there be correct thought, there cannot be right action;
and when there is correct thought, right action WILL follow."&nbsp;</small>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Not only is the PTS efficient, it is also
fair. For ages, people have debated the just basis for taxation:
ability to pay versus benefits received. The property tax shift settles
the argument in favor of both sides. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>First, land "dues" (taxes, fees,
liturgy, or some combination of the forgoing), especially when coupled
with an untaxing of homes, jobs, and enterprises, are inherently
progressive. </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Second, land dues are scaled
according to site values.
Site values measure not what an owner puts into the "common kitty" but
what one takes out. A prime location has the most advantages; it's the
one enjoying the best that society and nature have to offer. For owners
to enjoy those locations exclusively, and to pay more for doing so, is
exquisitely just.<strong> ...</strong></small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To recognize that "the earth is
the Lord's" is to see that the same God who established communities has
also in his providence ordained for them, through the land itself, a
just source of revenue. Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this
revenue goes mainly into the pockets of monopolists, while communities
meet their needs by extorting individuals the fruits of their honest
toil. If ever there were any doubt that structural sin exists, our
present system of taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments
penalizing individuals for their industry and creativity, while the
socially produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact
proportion to the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland,
the greater the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or
notion of justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate
the Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
have a corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a
well-nigh universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more
sinful than are people at large, except to the degree that they
knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation.
Many abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system,
it is better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
does. The profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially
desirable as well as in ways that are socially destructive. <strong>Let us give
testimony to our faith that the earth is the Lord's by building a
social order in which there are no victims.</strong> <a
