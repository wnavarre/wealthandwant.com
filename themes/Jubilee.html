but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Claiming
the Promised Land: A New
Jubilee for a New World</span></small><br>
<small>In the book of Joshua, we find that although the Promised Land
is a
gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even before the
actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed a
method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's
sight. The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with
human sacrifice and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive,
monopolistic social order. By contrast, Israel, to make good its claim,
had to institute a social order that would guard against the
desecration, pollution, and injustices of which its predecessors were
guilty, and would secure to each family and to every generation within
the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use of the land, of
which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner.</small><br>
<br>
<small>They began with a census of the tribes and families before the
conquest
(Num. 26:1-51). Every tribe, excepting Levi, and within each tribe
every family, was to receive its proportionate share, according to size
(Num. 26:55-56), and ultimately, to ensure fairness, by lot (Num.
34:16-29). The actual distribution, according to these provisions, was
concluded at Shiloh (Josh. 19:51). <span style="font-weight: bold;">According
to ancient historian Josephus, the territory was not divided into
shares of equal size but of equal agricultural value. The landmarks
that protected these allotments were protected by the public and solemn
denunciation of a curse against anyone who should dishonestly tamper
with them</span> (Deut. 27:11-16; 19:14).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As discovered again in our own
century, it is easier to devise a one-time fair apportionment of land
than it is to keep the system from falling apart. This is why the
ancient law established the Jubilee year. At the end of every fifty
years, any alienated lands -- given away, sold, or lost from unpaid
debts -- would be restored to the original families.</span> Temporary
possessors were to be compensated for any unexhausted improvements they
may have made on the land. Concentrated landownership, and the division
of society into landed and landless classes, was thereby prevented from
creeping into the system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
Jubilee effectively took the profit out of landholding as such, leaving
no incentive for speculation. When it was observed -- and historical
records indicate that it was observed for long periods -- the Jubilee
system successfully removed the root cause of poverty from the Jewish
society.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The influence of the Jubilee idea upon <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">early
Pennsylvania colonists</span> is evidenced by the inscription on the
Liberty Bell of the biblical words enjoining the Jubilee year:
"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof." (Lev. 25:10) The founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn,
advocated that all men be "tenants to the public", and to defray public
expenses instituted a tax on land.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmental concern also goes
back
to biblical land laws. </span>To prevent the exhaustion of the soil, a
periodic fallow was ordered. "During one year in every seven, the soil,
left to the influences of sun and frost, wind and rain, was to be
allowed to 're-create' itself after six years' cropping, exactly as the
tiller of the soil renewed his strength, after six days' work, by his
Sabbath day's rest."</small><br>
<br>
<small>As noted, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the tribe of Levi
did not
share in the equal division of the land, since it was charged with
carrying out religious and public duties</span>. Its members were
entitled to an indemnity from the eleven tribes who received the land
that otherwise would have gone to them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This indemnity was the tithe -- one-tenth
of the product from the land occupied by the eleven other tribes.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, in principle, is the
formula for
a just land system in almost any time or place. The compensation to the
Levites maintained the substance of equal rights to land, alongside of
and compatible with unequal physical division of the land itself.</span>
As Frederick Verinder pointed out in his book <span
 style="font-style: italic;">My Neighbour's Landmark</span>, joint
heirs of a house may share it equally by occupying it equally or
unequally but "paying the rental into a common fund, from which each
draws an equal share; or they may let the whole house to someone else
and divide the rent equally."<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> So it is with
land. Sharing equally in the economic rent or value of land through the
application of that value to common uses from which all benefit,
renders private ownership and unequal partition of land morally and
pragmatically benign.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The modern equivalent of
removing
one's neighbor's landmark is thus not the private ownership of land per
se, but rather the private appropriation of land value.</span> "The
profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic,
to assure everyone the same natural opportunity, asserts that all
people have an equal right to economic rent, and the Levite tithe
demonstrates that the socialization of rent offsets the ethical and
practical harm resulting from private land ownership. But there is
another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
should be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises
in large measure from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of
population, and community activity in a particular area. </span>More
people means more demand for space on which to live and work. Community
activities such as roads, schools, protection, parks, sewage, utilities
and other public services, as well as the totality of private
commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive or
desirable. It follows that a community which funds such improvements
out of its rent fund will be provided with a stable and growing fund
with which to maintain and improve them. And unlike conventional taxes,
the collection of this fund will enhance, not penalize, the production
of wealth.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare
capacity as
landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate
scarcity, artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any
positive contribution to production on the part of landowners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>While land value is not the only type of unearned increment,
unearned
income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not
at the expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of
property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx
could have -- but did not -- champion the abolition of land monopoly;
instead he advocated its transfer from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how
the universal principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be
applied to the modern age in all its economic aspects -- rural and
urban, agricultural and industrial, technologically undeveloped or
advanced.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to
leave
land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the
existing machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to
purchase or to confiscate private property in land. The first would be
unjust; the second, needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land;
it is only necessary to confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be
expropriated or evicted. No limit would be placed on the quantity of
land one could hold, as long as the annual rent were paid.</span></small><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the
capture
of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor --
improvements, personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. --
would be reduced and ultimately eliminated.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small>George considered his remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw
the
growth of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as
an expression of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes
on... so do the common wants increase and so does the necessity for
public revenue arise. And so in that value which attaches to land, not
by reason of anything the individual does, but by reason of the growth
of the community, is a provision intended -- we may safely say intended
-- to meet that social want."</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way
to
stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity,
in the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land
speculation and monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes
can be impelled to serve the needs of the public via investment in
production, not by further investment in land speculation and monopoly.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Dependency theory, to the degree that it hits upon one of the
causes of
Third World poverty in exploitation by foreign investors, can find in
George's land value tax the constructive practical approach it lacks.
Neither erection of trade barriers nor legal restriction of foreign
ownership is called for. As one Australian writer puts it:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">(W)hen
investors from one country buy property in other countries they are
seeking <span style="font-weight: bold;">site rent</span>, which they
hope to obtain directly from tenants, or indirectly by selling land in
the future when the price or capital value has increased.... The site
rent that is so attractive to overseas investors can be kept in the
country quite easily - - by shifting taxation from labor onto land."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because George asserted, "We
must make
land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded as an
advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was nothing
of the sort. </span>The expropriation of land makes it practically
impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
which are their legitimate property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George's system
renders to the community what is due to the community, without doing
any violence to the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive
workers.&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
      the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
      argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity,
      and are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained
      them from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and
      natural resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every
      one of the N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal
      beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile
      soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own
      vine and his own fig tree.</p>
    <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
      land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
      of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
      Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
      use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
      years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
      owner.</p>
    <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
      of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
      expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
      owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
      a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here
      I am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
      in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
    <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
      of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on
      it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the
      original sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to
      hold his &quot;fair share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a
      land tax about equal to his dividend check, and so would break even. By
      1/Nth of the land is meant land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value
      of all the land in the country.</p>
    <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
      as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to
      hold more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would
      prefer to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check
      representing the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
    <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
      at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough
      to feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and
      1/Nth of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population.
      A family of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend
      checks will enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied
      to that land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of
      course, they may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably,
      but the situation from which we start is one in which everyone has his
      own plot of ground from which to wrest a living by the strength of his
      own back, and any deviation from this is the result of voluntary exchanges
      agreed to by the parties directly involved, who judge themselves to be
      better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
    <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
      conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
      land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
      or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
      uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
      (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
      of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
      means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the
      people. Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
      term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that
      the landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
      for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
      other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings
      on the land that is being seized.</p>
    <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
      support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
      Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
      Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
      F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized
      by Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and
      the Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight
      of the Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the
      proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton
      Friedman</a>, 1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani,
      1985; James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
      S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
    <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
      cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
      tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
      to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the
      land and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that
      real estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make
      the two assessments separately, and a parcel of land in the business district
      of a large city very often has a different owner from the building on it.)
      Many cities have moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements,
      and most have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are
      more likely to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and
      that of the public -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they
      improve their land by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
    <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
      proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental
      and reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results
      of a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the
      difference in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other
      proposals of the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me
      absolute dictator of the world so that I can supervise the distribution,
      and if it doesn't work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that
      absolute dictators seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read
