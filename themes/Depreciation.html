  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>With the heady increases in the
              costs of housing along the coasts, particularly in California,
        most of us tend to forget that our homes,
                  like all things manmade, are constantly depreciating. (Those
        who rent property out don't forget it, because the IRS permits them to
        deduct an allowance for depreciation; see some of the excerpts below
        for more on that subject.) </p>
      <p>A June, 2006, Federal Reserve Board study pegs the depreciation on single
        family homes, that is, the structures themselves, at 1.5% per year. The
        IRS uses 27.5 years, which works out to about 3.5% per year, for investors.</p>
      <p>We may spend our leisure time or our money
          fighting
          that depreciation, by
          maintaining,
            painting,
                replacing
                    systems, upgrading systems, etc., but gradually the value
        of the
            house itself is falling. The amazing increases in the value of land,
          however, have
                so
                    totally overshadowed the decreases in the value of the house
          that we are tempted to forget that fact. And few journalists seem to
        yet make the distinction between the land value and the building value.</p>
      <p>Only when a home in our neighborhood
              is
                  torn
                      down &#8212; at some cost &#8212; and replaced with something
                      new and technologically and otherwise up to date, does
                      it come to our
                      attention
                      that it
                      is truly the <em>site</em> which has value. This doesn't
                      tend to happen where land is inexpensive and readily available
                      within a reasonable
                      distance,
                      but in
                      the areas surrounding some of our older and healthier cities,
                      it is common. The Boston, Chicago and New York metropolitan
                      areas in particular
                      are seeing
                many teardowns in the wealthiest suburbs.</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.</strong>    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p><strong>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again.</strong> <strong>Wood decays, iron rusts,
    stone disintegrates and is displaced, while of more perishable products,
    some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use.</strong> Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. <strong>Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural
    material is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    </strong>As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, <strong>you are
    right in so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair
    will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use.</strong> But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
    new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
    never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
    the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Bishop
    of Meath</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit
      filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR.... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

WHEN we speak of a community increasing in wealth we do not mean to say that
  there is more land, or that the natural powers of the land are greater, or
  that there are more people (for when we wish to express that idea we speak
  of increase of population) or that the debts or dues owing by some of these
  people to others of their number have increased; but we mean that there is
  an increase of certain tangible things, having an actual and not merely a relative
  value &#8212; such as buildings, cattle, tools, machinery, agricultural and
  mineral products, manufactured goods, ships, wagons, furniture and the like.
  . . . The common character of these things is that they consist of natural
  substances or products which have been adapted by human labor to human use
  or gratification, their value depending on the amount of labor which upon the
  average would be required to produce things of like kind.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

WEALTH is not the sole object of labor, for labor is also expended in ministering
directly to desire; but it is the object and result of what we call productive
labor &#8212; that is, labor which gives value to material things. Nothing which
nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth, nor yet does the expenditure
of labor result in wealth unless there is a tangible product which has and retains
the power of ministering to desire. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

IT will be well for a moment to consider this idea of accumulated wealth. The
truth is, that wealth can be accumulated but to a slight degree, and that communities
really live, as the vast majority of individuals live, from hand to mouth. Wealth
will not bear much accumulation; except in a few unimportant forms it will not
keep. The matter of the universe, which, when worked up by labor into desirable
forms, constitutes wealth, is constantly tending back to its original state.
Some forms of wealth will last for a few hours, some for a few days, some for
a few months, some for a few years; and there are very few forms of wealth that
can be passed from one generation to another. Take wealth in some of its most
useful and permanent forms &#8212; ships, houses, railways, machinery. Unless
labor is constantly exerted in preserving and renewing them, they will almost
immediately become useless. Stop labor in any community, and wealth would vanish
almost as the jet of a fountain vanishes when the flow of water is shut off.
Let labor again exert itself, and wealth will almost as immediately reappear.
Accumulated wealth seems to play just about such a part in relation to the social
organism as accumulated nutriment does to the physical organism. Some accumulated
wealth is necessary, and to a certain extent it may be drawn upon in exigencies;
but the wealth produced by past generations can no more account for the consumption
of the present than the dinners he ate last year can supply a man with present
strength. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html"> &#8212; Book

<blockquote>
  <p>Note 69: Demand for consumption is satisfied not from hoards of accumulated
    wealth, but from the stream of current production. Broadly speaking there
    can be
    no accumulation of wealth in the sense of saving up wealth from generation
    to generation. Imagine a man's satisfying his demand for eggs from the accumulated
    stores of his ancestors! Yet eggs do not differ in this respect from other
    forms of wealth, except that some other forms will keep a little longer,
    and some not so long.</p>
  <p>The notion that a saving instinct must be aroused before the great and more
    lasting forms of wealth can be brought forth is a mistake. Houses and locomotives,
    for example, are built not because of any desire to accumulate wealth, but
    because we need houses to live in and locomotives to transport us and our
    goods. It is not the saving, but the serving,, instinct that induces the
    production of these things; the same instinct that induces the production
    of a loaf of bread.</p>
  <p><strong>Artificial things do not save. No sooner are the processes of production
    from land complete than the products are on their way back to the land. If
    man does not return them by means of consumption, then through decay they
    return themselves. </strong>Mankind as a whole lives literally from hand to mouth.
    What is demanded for consumption in the present must be produced by the labor
    of the present. From current production, and from that alone, can current
    consumption be satisfied.</p>
  <p>&quot;Accumulated wealth&quot; is, in fact, not wealth at all in any great
    degree. It is merely titles to wealth yet to be produced. A share in a mining
    company, for example, is but a certificate that the owner is legally entitled
    to a proportion of the wealth to be produced in the future from a certain
    mine.</p>
  <p>Titles to future wealth may be both morally and legally valid. This is so
    when they represent past labor or its products loaned in free contract for
    future labor or its products; for example, a contract for the delivery of
    goods of any kind today to be paid for next week. or next month, or next
    year, or in ten years, or later.</p>
  <p>They may be legally but not morally valid. This is so when they represent
    the product of a franchise (whether paid for in labor or not) to exact tribute
    from future labor; for example, a franchise to confiscate a man's labor through
    ownership of his body, as in slavery, or a franchise to confiscate the products
    of labor in general through ownership of land.</p>
  <p>Or they may be both legally and morally invalid, as when they are obtained
    by illegal force or fraud from the rightful owner. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For private lands, much of the revenue
    from geo-rent is hidden in interest payments, corporate profits, and capital
    gains, implying that it isn&#8217;t showing up in &#8220;rental income of
    persons.&#8221; For example, the way that building-owners may treat &#8220;depreciation&#8221; is
    unrealistic and even nonsensical. Suppose Bob buys a building for $275,000
    (excluding the land value) and rents it out for $40,000 per year. On the
    premise that a building is used up in 27.5 years, the tax code allows him
    to deduct $10,000 each year. And then he deducts his real expense (maintenance,
    etc.) of, say, $5,000, so the column shows only $25,000 in rental income.
    Suppose that after 27.5 years, Bob sells the building to Sam. Now Sam starts
    deducting depreciation all over again. Capital consumption is to a large
    degree a legal fiction. <a

    operating rents (&#8220;cash flow&#8221;) to arrive at taxable rents. They

    economists -- mutual validation of mutual error, the curse of science.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When owner A has exhausted his tax &#8220;basis&#8221; by
  overdepreciating, he sells to B for a price well above the remaining basis.
  B then depreciates the same building all over again, then sells to C, who sells
  to D, and so on, so each building is tax-depreciated several times during its
  economic life. In any given year, most income properties in the U.S.A. are
  being tax-depreciated, even though most have already been depreciated once
  or more.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, all owners after the original builder
  are in a position to depreciate some of the land value, as well. This is because
  the owners control the &#8220;allocation of basis&#8221; between depreciable
  building and non-depreciable land. The IRS has no defense against secondary
  owners who overallocate value to the depreciable building. Congress has never
  authorized the IRS to develop any in-house capacity to value land. The most
  the agency does, if it will not accept the word of the tax filer, is to look
  at allocations used by local assessors. These parties, in turn (with a few
  notable exceptions), underassess land relative to buildings, by using the erroneous &#8220;land-residual&#8221; method
  of dividing land from building value. This is partly to accommodate their local
  constituents - assessors are locally elected or appointed, and do not report
  to the IRS. A little math will tell you that to depreciate land just once is
  to achieve perpetual tax exemption. To depreciate it again and again is a continuing
  subsidy for holding land.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When A sells to B there is a large excess of the
  sales price over the remaining or &#8220;undepreciated&#8221; basis. This excess
  is, to be sure, taxable income. However, Congress has defined this kind of
  income as a &#8220;capital gain.&#8221; Most rents, therefore, show up as capital
  gains. These, in turn, are subject to lower tax rates, deferral of tax, forgiveness
  at time of death, constant pressure to lower rates to zero, and a dozen additional
  avoidance devices. These are known to every lawyer and accountant and Congressman,
  but not, apparently, to most economists, who lazily report from &#8220;official&#8221; data
  that rents are a low fraction of national income. &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_StRPOL15LE.html">Read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain," that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most

the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two appraisal methods</small><br>
<br>
<small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways. Both start by estimating its
market value. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
land-residual approach</span> subtracts the value of buildings from
this overall value, designating the remainder as the value of land. ...
<b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing the land, and
treats the difference as representing the building's value.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong></strong>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IF THE APPRAISAL controversy is
framed in terms of business cycle
analysis, then the statistician finds no reasonable alternative to
seeing that when the cycle rises and falls, the difference must be in
the land, not buildings. <b>What people are buying are not
reproduction costs, whose fluctuations over the course of the credit
cycle are relatively minor. They are buying site value, which is in
limited supply, akin to a natural monopoly.</b> Most of all, real
estate investors and homeowners are buying the right to resell their
property as prices are bid up by what they expect to become an
increasingly affluent economy fuelled by an abundant supply of
mortgage credit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach appears
to work as long as a fairly
constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
serious problems for statisticians.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
a thriving real estate market appraisers typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
practice
is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the anomaly occurs when
real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is a curious asymmetry.
Building prices seem to be
responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
turns negative. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Immortally aging
buildings</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be
minimized in two ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The most general -- and also the most economically
pernicious -- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. The
working assumption is that interest charges are a truly inherent
business expense, not simply the result of a business decision taken by
investors to leverage their equity. For interest to be an inherent
business expense, interest-bearing debt would have to be a factor of
production, which it is not. Properties would yield their rent
regardless of how they are financed. Investors choose to rely on debt
rather than equity financing because the tax laws favor it, thanks to
the political lobbying of <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutional
creditors ("the debt lobby")</span>. Homeowners too deduct interest
payments, which encourages borrowing.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to
depreciation the building, that is, annually deduct from taxable income
part of the purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is
"written off" </b>It's the most unique tax advantage enjoyed by the
real estate industry. Investors are able to depreciate their buildings
based on their assessed acquisition price, regardless of the actual
building costs involved or the level of economy-wide land-price
inflation. Investors depreciate buildings at rising prices even when
prior owners already have depreciated these structures once or even
many times. For real estate owned by households and partnerships (the
latter being the preferred legal instrument for holding residential
apartment buildings and office buildings), the Fed has estimated much
higher proportions of land to buildings, but these estimates also
overvalue buildings relative to land. <b>Every time a property changes
hands at a higher price, building assessments are raised proportionally
- and begin to be re-depreciated for these higher valuations,
regardless of how often the buildings already have been written off!
There is no limit as to how often a building can be re-depreciated.</b>
What matters is simply how often the property changes nominal hands.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
fiscal privilege has created a phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tax laws governing
depreciation thus turn largely on how much
value is assigned to buildings relative to the land, which is not
depreciable. Like manufacturers, real estate owners are permitted to
count part of the revenue over and above their current expenses as a
return of their capital investment, as distinct from taxable earnings
on capital. No income taxes are levied on this part of their revenue.
That is only fair, because an investor who buys a $100 bond only pays
tax on the interest, not on the original $100 principal. Likewise,
industrialists can recover their initial investment in plant and
equipment without being taxed. Their "sunk cost" gets reimbursed, so
that they get their capital back by the time the equipment wears out
or becomes obsolete.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
real estate, however, the economics are unique. Machinery
rarely can be re-depreciated, but this is not true of buildings as
long as they are kept in proper repair. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance and repairs
typically consume about 10 percent of the rental value.</span> For
business
owners, the explicit purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the
building's value intact, so that it can survive year after year and
avoid obsolescence while its site value rises. If a building is sold
at a higher price, its assessment usually is raised.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Suppose a
property is sold for twice the $1 milliuon the owner paid for it. The
local appraiser is likely to say; "I see you've sold your building
for $2 million. Under my rule of thumb, I appraise the land as half
this value, and the building as half, so that gives you a $1 million
dollar building." Under this rule, the building that was formerly
priced at $500,000 can be re-depreciated at a price that builds in
this $500,000 gain. In this way a substantial portion of the rise in
site value of non-depreciable land is treated as depreciable building
value.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE FREE LUNCH:</b> <b>Its
cost to citizens</b></small><br>
<small><b></b></small><br>
<small><b></b>The recycling of savings into new mortgage lending has
fueled an economy-wide inflation of asset prices for land, homes, and
commercial properties, as well as stock market and bond prices. If what
rises in value is mainly the land site, then the property owners appear
as passive beneficiaries enjoying a free lunch. The property is their
major asset and the mortgage their major debt. While doing little to
increase the value of the building beyond having picked a good location
and making the normal maintenance, they ride the crest of asset-price
inflation of land . Indeed, take-home earnings have drifted down over
the past two decades, but house prices have soared. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These "capital gains" for
households are part of the new phenomenon that has been popularized as
"labor capitalism." As Margaret Thatcher's crowd has put it, "Sorry
you've lost your job; I hope you've made a killing on your Council
House or home in the real estate market." The free lunch.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For the two-thirds of America's
and Britain's populations who are home owners, this free lunch from
asset-price inflation of land has proved to be a silver lining in the
post-industrial economy. For the remaining third of the population,
however, the price of access to home ownership is receding rapidly.
Today it hardly is possible for most renters to earn the money to
acquire their own homes. The entry price has been bid up too high by
those hoping to gain from asset-price inflation even as labor's
earnings have been declining.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Its cost to the
economy</b></small><br>
<small>Once a building has taken all its depreciation, investors have a
tax motive to sell the property and buy another. The sales price
obviously will be higher if the new buyer can begin depreciating the
building all over again, for the property will yield more after-tax
revenue. This financial trick turns the real estate sector into a game
of musical chairs, while enabling property owners to avoid income
taxation. The end result is to free more of their cash flow to pledge
to mortgage lenders as interest, in exchange for loans to buy more and
more property that is rising in price. This is the anatomy of the
dramatic increase in land-prices, called the real estate bubble. The
tragedy of modern economies is this divergence of saving away from
financing new direct investment and employment, to inflate a financial
and real estate bubble. When the bubble bursts there will be little new
tangible wealth creation to show for it, only a wave of insolvency,
bankruptcy and foreclosures as the Western economies begin to look more
like that of Japan since its bubble burst a decade ago. America's and
Europe's largest economic expansion may similarly give way to a long
depression. Its cause will remain invisible as long as the politically
powerful real estate interests keep getting land undevalued and its
income masked as capital gains on the national income and product
accounts</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>SUMMARY</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>
On the other hand, the Fed statistics</big><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
understate land values for methodological reasons. Starting with
estimates for overall real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.</small><font size="-1"></font></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><small></small>However, the value of any building tends
eventually to decline,
until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
not its current net income but its opportunity cost -- the minimum
yield
required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.</small>

<br>

current income, and correctly so.</small><br>
<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land income also includes
service flows
other than cash.&nbsp;
Because of its versatility, and fundamental character, land often
yields

<br>
<small>It is common for economists to write of the "imputed income of
durable consumer capital." especially owner-occupied houses, and
occasionally to persuade some political candidate to advocate including
their imputed income in the income tax base, or at least to end the
deduction of interest and property taxes paid on house values.&nbsp;
Those making such proposals, unfortunately, fail to exercise reasonable
care in distinguishing houses from land.&nbsp; Much or most of the
non-cash service flow received from consumer <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">capital </span>proper is not
income
at all, but two other things: a return from operation, maintenance, and
upkeep; and a return <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span>
capital.&nbsp; Depreciation and expenses offset
more than half the service flow from most owner-occupied houses,
especially middle-aged buildings on the steep slope of the depreciation
curve.&nbsp; The service flow from land, on the other hand, is pure
income.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The measure of this imputed land income is not subjective nor
fuzzy.&nbsp; It is interest on the market price of the land, a measure
of
its opportunity cost (cf.&nbsp; <a

space from his or her employer must pay income taxes on its imputed
value
in excess of $155/month.&nbsp; The imputed value is simply what nearby
or comparable parking lots charge.&nbsp; Employers are supposed to
figure the value and include it on W-2 forms, beginning with 1994
taxes.&nbsp; (David E. Rosenbaum, 1994, "IRS eludes parking tax
law."&nbsp; New York Times News Service.&nbsp; Riverside, California,
The Press-Enterprise, 24 Feb., p. A-12.) </small></small><small><a

<small><b>Use the
Building-Residual Method of Allocating Value</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is equally important to use the
"Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: the residual, if any, is
building value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuing one lot or parcel this
way, you have information needed
for valuing neighboring and other comparable parcels. Using a map
with value contours, you can value a whole city this way with
surprising ease and speed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using this method, I valued
Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?
Yes, I really said "tripled." <span style="font-weight: bold;">By his
methods, buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down. </span>Besides
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">depreciation
</span>and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">technological
obsolescence</span>, many buildings suffered
severe "<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">locational
obsolescence</span>," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using the building-residual method
requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure</span>, just as the old single-tax
campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Federal Income Taxes
</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of assessors' greatest
problems today is the strong pressures
from owners who want to allocate as much value as possible to
buildings that they may depreciate for federal income tax purposes.
Here is where we must study how the parts form the big picture. Here
is where federal and local tax policies intersect. Some Georgists
have neglected or misunderstood the income-tax treatment of land
income. Let us see how this works.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Congress and the IRS let one
depreciate buildings, but not land,
for income tax. This important distinction harks back to when the
income tax was new, and Georgist Congressmen like Warren Worth
Bailey, from Johnstown, PA and Henry George Jr., from Brooklyn were
instrumental in shaping it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a building is new, the
depreciable value is limited to the
cost of construction. The non-depreciable land is the bare land value
before construction. So far, so good. Over time, however, building
owners have converted this into a tax shelter scheme. Owner A, the
builder, writes off the building in a few years, much less than its
economic life, and sells it to B. "A" pays a tax on the excess of
sales price over "basis." The basis is reduced by all depreciation
taken, so any excess depreciation is "recaptured" upon sale. It is
defined by Congress as a "capital gain," and given the corresponding
package of tax preferences:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>deferral of tax,</small></li>
  <li><small>lower rate,</small></li>
  <li><small>step-up of basis at time of death,</small></li>
  <li><small>tax-free exchanges, etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus far, any tax preference goes
to A, the builder, and may be
seen as a wellconsidered building incentive. Watch, however, what
happens next. "<span style="font-weight: bold;">A" sells to B and B
depreciates the building all over
again, from his purchase price. To do so, B must allocate the new
"basis" - i.e., his purchase price - between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How shall B allocate the new basis?<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Enter the local tax
assessor.</span>
Here is where local assessment intersects with Federal income tax
policy. The IRS does not try to assess land and buildings. Instead,
IRS instructions tell taxpayers they may use locally assessed values
to allocate basis between depreciable buildings and non-depreciable
land. The IRS accepts this allocation as conclusive. As a result,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">local owners of income property press
their assessors to allocate as
much value as possible to buildings, and as little as possible to
land. This does not affect their local taxes, but lowers their
federal taxes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It lets them
depreciate land.</span></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Local revenues are not immediately
affected. Local assessors have
little reason not to accommodate their constituents, local
landowners, to help them depreciate land for federal and state income
tax purposes. They have little reason to use the correct
"building-residual'' method of allocating value, and a compelling
reason to use the wrong method that understates land value. Thus they
convert non-depreciable land value into depreciable building value.
It is the modern version of "competitive underassessment." In the
process, they also convert the local property tax from a land tax
into a building tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After a while B sells to C, who in
turn sells to D, so each
building is depreciated many times. So is a large part of the land
under it, time after time, although it should not be depreciated at
all. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This
is carried so far that real estate pays no federal or state
income taxes at all.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution to this lies with the
U.S. Congress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The need is to
limit depreciation to one cycle only. It is a most urgent problem for
both federal and local treasuries. </span>We all have Congressmen.
Write to
them and raise their consciousness. They are brokers who respond to
public opinion. It is we who are derelict. <a

<blockquote>
  <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
      the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
      policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium is placed
      upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy penalty
      is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
      depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
      with the land.</p>
  <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put up
      a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin which
      now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and while paying
      a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby enabled
      to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
      is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
      amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
      and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
      letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
      till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it?</p>
  <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
      making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it from
      the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.</p>
  <p>Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better
      and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores, more employment
      for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
      an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a public
      revenue adequate to all real public needs.</p>
  <p>What a contrast to the existing plan of pouring public money into the laps
      of individual landowners ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
    the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
    oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5 to
    1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9 And in view of the fact
    that assessments in New York localities have historically been very infrequent,
    one can understand how the land values are in reality a far higher proportion
    of parcel value than assessments would suggest.10 This means that in a period
    of seven years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
    by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to be illustrative.
    Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their rates of change during
    this time span; upstate New York was largely stable, but downstate localities
    experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
  <p>    Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
    view&#8221; of
    property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the burden
    of the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital in the form
    of a lower net return instead of being shifted to users of property in the
    form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11 Proponents point out that &#8220;the
    tax on improvements is essentially a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and
    therefore] its incidence will depend on the characteristics of supply and
    demand for capital nationally rather than on a single market.&#8221;12 The
    effect of this is to make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;13 Nonetheless,
    in a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old
    view&#8221; in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that
    the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific
    state (underlining in original). Thus, the old or traditional view was adhered
    to in the analysis. . ; that is, the excise effect of the tax was considered
    dominant.&#8221;14 The ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has
    over 1,300 local assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their
    notice. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
  one
  thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
  the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
  political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
  tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
  address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
  could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
  buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
  the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
  powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
  efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
  site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
  is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... <br>
  </strong><br>
  <font size="3"><small>Another failed practice is assessment. Now
  assessors must combine
  building and land values and slip into evaluating by current use which
  is often less than potential use. They also undervalue large lots,
  vacant lots, parking lots, and underused locations. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Value that should
  have been assigned to the location they attribute to the building, a
  capital asset which for income tax avoidance can be rapidly
  depreciated, benefiting the wealthiest land owners.</span> Thus the
  property
  tax is made regressive. <strong>... </strong></small></font><br>
  <br>
  <font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
  needs a
  matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
  we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
  earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a
