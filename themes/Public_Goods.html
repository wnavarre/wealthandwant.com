<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The more it is examined the more clearly it will be seen that there is no
    valid reason why we should, in any case, attempt to tax all property. That
    equality should be the rule and aim of taxation is true, and this for the
    reason given in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created
    equal. But equality does not require that all men should be taxed alike,
    or that all things should be taxed alike. It merely requires that whatever
    taxes are imposed shall be equally imposed upon the persons or things in
    like conditions or situations; it merely requires that no citizen shall be
    given an advantage, or put at a disadvantage, as compared with other citizens.</p>
  <p> The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the
    Constitution of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence.
    To insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to
    each individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit
    of happiness &#8212; these are the proper ends of government, and are therefore
    the ends which in every scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.<br />
    <br />
  As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
  limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if the
  increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could not
  be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
  Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
  and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained in
  this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York a more
  desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and light could
  be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied to each house
  at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual effort,
  or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to give every
  one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average resident,
  the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be increased
  burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York would become
  a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn taxation as bad
  merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional provision,
  as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our States has
  been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction upon
  the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is the far-reaching
  statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his proposition that
  all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain brief term &#8212; a
  proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth that the earth belongs
  in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have no control over it, and can
  give no title to any part of it. But restriction upon public debts is a very
  different thing from restriction upon the power of taxation, and reasons which
  urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor is increased taxation necessarily
  proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in taxation is in the order of
  social development, for the reason that social development tends to the doing
  of things collectively that in a ruder state are done individually, to the
  giving to government of new functions and the imposing of new duties. Our public
  schools and libraries and parks, our signal service and fish commissions and
  agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations, are evidences of this.<strong><font size="+1">  ...</font></strong></p>
  <p>The possession of wealth is the inducement to the exertion necessary to
    the production and maintenance of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure
    of working, but to get the things their work will give them. And to tax the
    things that are produced by exertion is to lessen the inducement to exertion.
    But over and above the benefit to the possessor, which is the stimulating
    motive to the production of wealth, there is a benefit to the community,
    for no matter how selfish he may be, it is utterly impossible for any one
    to entirely keep to himself the benefit of any desirable thing he may possess.
    These diffused benefits when localized give value to land, and this may be
    taxed without in any wise diminishing the incentive to production.</p>
  <p> To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p> See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p> Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p> So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p> Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

        of the
    Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b>
</small><br>
<small>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their
embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas
provide for the natural financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive -- parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in which our ideas
promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful....&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span

Efficiency and Preventing
Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</small></small></a></small></font></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
truly national public goods, other ideas must be explored.</span> One
of the major national public goods is defense. In a perfectly just
world, everyone would be so respectful of the rights of others, and
everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending would be
desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want
public defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?
</small><br>
<br>
<small>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
can be provided by a
Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital, which makes
a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S. requires
a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it is
because the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a
more attractive target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital
might reasonably be charged for the increase in the defense budget
that is needed to make other citizens as safe as they would be if
that one person's capital were not adding to the attractiveness of
nation as a target. It would be interesting to know how much of the
defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a
self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per year on the value of all assets
and contractual rights, to pay the costs of defense. The owner
assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and if anyone wants
to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There could
be a
personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption for
personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of
local police and courts.
</small><br>
<br>
<small>An even greater share of the federal budget is used for various
programs that provide help for people with special needs--welfare,
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment insurance, disaster
assistance, etc. Some of these programs (social security, Medicare,
and unemployment compensation) are funded in part by payments by
prospective beneficiaries. But all incorporate substantial elements
of deliberate redistribution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...&nbsp;

Fred Foldvary: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a
 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent:
A Plea to Public Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public goods are usually defined
as both nonrival and nonexcludable.
The public finance literature often alleges &#8220;market failure&#8221; for goods
such as streets, sewers, parks, security, and fire fighting. Once a
collective good is provided, it is not practical or desirable to
exclude persons. For example, even if one agrees that people can be
excluded from a city park, it would not be desirable to have walls and
gates to keep out the free riders.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The &#8220;free rider&#8221; doctrine, however, tends to treat public goods
as
though they have no location in space and time. Somewhere, out in the
ether, there is a public good and some users who cannot be made to pay
for benefits. But the benefits of most real-world public goods fall
within an ambit that is territorial. Accordingly, those benefits become
capitalized into the market price of land within that ambit. Those
using the civic services are included by proximity; it is costly for
far-away users to visit a neighborhood park. Residents, businesses, and
customers willingly pay more because they benefit from the territorial
goods. Most users therefore do make payments that are proportional to
such amenities, since they must pay to use land.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> But the payments are
made to the landowner</span>. The market-failure doctrine for public
goods is
turned on its head: Users do tend to pay in an indirect sense, and
government policy creates the free riding of the landowners, at the
expense of the extraneous taxpayers. Rather than correcting any
deficiency of markets, policy is iatrogenic, that is, illness caused by
the doctor. Streets, parks, and security suffer from free riding
because the doctor made it that way. This insight is rarely found in
mainstream sources. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html">A Bill of
Economic Rights and Obligations</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Communities are allowed to have
whatever taxes and regulations
their citizens choose. Anyone who is dissatisfied can live elsewhere.
While communities would be permitted to tax wages and interest if
they wished, they would find it attractive to do so only if their
citizens were content with such sharing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The primary source of
financing for communities would be the rental value of land and other
natural opportunities. Because the provision of a worthwhile local
public good generally raises rent by enough to pay for the good,
communities would generally be able to finance themselves with only a
fraction of the rent of land.</span> The rest of rent could provide as
a
basic income for all. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Support for those who are unable to provide for themselves would
come from this basic income, from the generosity of the fellow
citizens of their community, and from insurance that their parents
might reasonable be expected to provide for them in a world in which
all parents received justice themselves. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the bill of economic rights
and obligations does not address
the issue explicitly, it should be understood that people have a
right to redress for past injustice, no matter how far back in the
past. If some persons have inferior starting positions because they
are the descendants of slaves who, because of that status, were
unable to provide what others provided to their children, then there
should be a levy on the property of the descendants of slave-owners
to rectify that injustice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In fulfilling its obligation to
ensure that future generations had
opportunities at least as great as those of the present generation,
people would want to take account of:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. The amount of land per
capita, adjusted for the quality of land;<br>
2. The level of technology that will be available;<br>
3. The education and any initial wealth that is provided to all
children;<br>
4. The level of public infrastructure;<br>
5. The level of public debt;<br>
6. Environmental quality;<br>
7. The price of depletable natural resources.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Decreases in some items could be
offset by increases in others. If
people wanted to have more children than could be provided with
opportunities equal to those of the present generation, Congress and
state legislatures would have an obligation to tax those who wanted
to have children, so that people would have fewer children, and so
that all children could be provided with an initial endowment upon
attaining maturity, to compensate for reductions in other items on
the list.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html"><span

  <p>A Second Set of Books</p>
  <p>Mental models begin with assumptions. Most economists today assume there
    are only two kinds of property, private (that is, corporate or individual)
    and state. There are no shared assets, no inter- or intragenerational obligations,
    and no nonhumans other than those we eat.</p>
  <p>Yet as we&#8217;ve seen, many things are missing here. The most obvious
    omission is the great economy of nature within which the human enterprise
    operates. We&#8217;re borrowing prodigiously from that economy, but not recording
    the loans. Equally absent are future generations, from whom we&#8217;re borrowing
    just as wantonly and surreptitiously. In a proper bookkeeping system, every
    loan shows up on two balance sheets, the borrower&#8217;s and the lender&#8217;s.
    One entity&#8217;s liability is another entity&#8217;s asset. But this isn&#8217;t
    true in contemporary economics. When the human economy grows, assets on corporate
    and individual balance sheets go up, but nowhere is there a debit. In fact,
    there aren&#8217;t any accounts that could be debited. There&#8217;s only
    good growth on one side of the ledger, and on the other, a void in which
    illth and debt accumulate, uncounted and unnoticed.</p>
  <p>In recent years, economists have added a few bits to this stripped-down
    model. For example, they now recognize public goods and ecosystem services
    as contributors of economic value. Public goods are services like national
    defense, education, and flood control, which benefit everyone but can&#8217;t
    easily be sold at a profit. Because markets don&#8217;t adequately supply
    them, governments step in and do so. Economists sometimes debate whether
    the value of these public goods exceeds the &#8220;burden&#8221; they impose
    on taxpayers, but they don&#8217;t see the expenditures as adding value to
    any account, or to any asset owned by anyone.</p>
  <p>Similarly, many economists now recognize ecosystem services as valuable
    inputs to the economy. However, the ecosystems that produce these services
    have no owners or balance sheets. They&#8217;re just there, floating in space,
    with no connection to humans. What I&#8217;m suggesting is that economists
    treat them as if they were common property held in trust. This simple supposition
    would not only put ecosystems on the books, enabling us to track them better;
    it would also pave the way to real-world property rights that actually protect
    those ecosystems. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There&#8217;s more than one way to
skin a cat. When Henry George
wrote &#8220;We must make land common property&#8221; it was in a place
and at a time when most land in sight had been privatized only
recently, using crude methods. &#8220;Force and fraud&#8221; were not
dim memories in 1879, but a living presence. So George&#8217;s phrase
did not strike people then as being any more shocking than it is
today to remind them that the public domain, with its pasturelands,
waters, rights of way, the air, radio spectrum, fish, mineral riches
and timber, belongs to us all in common. Today, to replicate
George&#8217;s impact, we would do well to train our sights on the
public domain that is currently being privatized.... <a

Distortions by Pricing:
Increasing the Recovery of Transportation Service Costs</span></small><br>
<small>With respect to charges upon transportation services and
externalities,
there are several components to a proper pricing design.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(25)</span></small> The
first step to proper pricing is to identify the proportion of
transportation services that ought rightly to be seen as private goods
as opposed to public goods.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(26)</span></small>
Although this is a daunting task, the frequent figure used is 80
percent - 20 percent proportion. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The public good proportion of road use
reflects the amount of reliance by services provided by the government
and associated agencies like mail service, national defense, public
safety (ambulance, police and fire departments), and so on. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The private
use of the roads constitutes the overwhelming amount of its use. This
means that as a rule 80 percent of the highway use charges should be
paid by individual drivers, directly or indirectly. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is easy to
distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental
externalities and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different
treatment with respect to revenue design.</small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>26. As economists use the term,
a public good is one whose consumption
is non-rival and non-exclusive. To be non-rival means that consumption
of a good or service by some does not preclude its consumption by
others. To be non-exclusive means that non-payers cannot be prohibited
from using that good or service. One economics textbook offers the
following alternative definition: "A public good is a commodity or
service whose benefits are not depleted by an additional user and for
which it is generally difficult or impossible to exclude people from
its benefits, even if they are unwilling to pay for them. In contrast,
a private good is characterized by both excludability and
depletability." William J. Baumol and Alan S. Blinder, Economics:
Principles and Policy, Third Edition (New York: Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, 1985), p.543. National defense, clean air, and mosquito
control are usually offered as cases of services that come as close to
being "pure" public goods as the real world offers. A private good, in
contrast, is one which has the attributes of being both rival and
exclusive. That is, its consumption by one party depletes its
availability to others, and consumers can be required to pay in order
to obtain it. A hamburger can be considered a private good insofar as
it cannot be eaten by two persons at the same time. For a good to be
exclusive means that those who do not pay can be barred from its
consumption: the metering of electric, gas, cable, and phone lines is
done to prevent non-payers from tapping in. Radio and television are
non-exclusive, and therefore are paid for not by consumer listeners but
through advertising. Highways have elements of both public and private
good, and the demand for each should ideally determine how much each
sector should pay. See also Musgrave, pp. 6-ff.&nbsp; ... <a
