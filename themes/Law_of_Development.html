<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Law
of Development<br>
</span><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The  Land Question</a>
(1881)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have here abolished all
hereditary privileges and legal distinctions of class. Monarchy,
aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept them all away. We have carried mere
political democracy to its ultimate. Every child born in the United
States may aspire to be President. Every man, even though he be a tramp
or a pauper, has a vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any
other man's vote. Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In
the name of the people all laws run. They are the source of all power,
the fountain of all honor. In their name and by their will all
government is carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it is
possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for our
public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had the
preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that here
every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full liberty of
speech and of the press. We have not merely common schools, but high
schools and universities, open to all who may choose to attend. Yet
here the same social difficulties apparent on the other side of the
Atlantic are beginning to appear. It is already clear that our
democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of equality a sham and a
fraud.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Already are the sovereign people becoming but a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">roi fain&eacute;ant</span>, like the
Merovingian kings of France, like the Mikados of Japan. The shadow of
power is theirs; but the substance of power is being grasped and
wielded by the bandit chiefs of the stock exchange, the robber leaders
who organize politics into machines. In any matter in which they are
interested, the little finger of the great corporations is thicker than
the loins of the people. Is it sovereign States or is it railroad
corporations that are really represented in the elective Senate which
we have substituted for an hereditary House of Lords? Where is the
count or marquis or duke in Europe who wields such power as is wielded
by such simple citizens as our Stanfords, Goulds, and Vanderbilts? What
does legal equality amount to, when the fortunes of some citizens can
be estimated only in hundreds of millions, and other citizens have
nothing? What does the suffrage amount to when, under threat of
discharge from employment, citizens can be forced to vote as their
employers dictate? when votes can be bought on election day for a few
dollars apiece? If there are citizens so dependent that they must vote
as their employers wish, so poor that a few dollars on election day
seem to them more than any higher consideration, then giving them votes
simply adds to the political power of wealth, and universal suffrage
becomes the surest basis for the establishment of tyranny. "Tyranny!"
There is a lesson in the very word. What are our American bosses but
the exact antitypes of the Greek tyrants, from whom the word comes?
They who gave the word tyrant its meaning did not claim to rule by
right divine. They were simply the Grand Sachems of Greek Tammanys, the
organizers of Hellenic "stalwart machines."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even if universal history did not teach the lesson, it is in the
United States already becoming very evident that political equality can
continue to exist only upon a basis of social equality; that where the
disparity in the distribution of wealth increases, political democracy
only makes easier the concentration of power, and must inevitably lead
to tyranny and anarchy. And it is already evident that there is nothing
in political democracy, nothing in popular education, nothing in any of
our American institutions, to prevent the most enormous disparity in
the distribution of wealth. Nowhere in the world are such great
fortunes growing up as in the United States. Considering that the
average income of the working masses of our people is only a few
hundred dollars a year, a fortune of a million dollars is a monstrous
thing &#8212; a more monstrous and dangerous thing under a democratic
government than anywhere else. Yet fortunes of ten and twelve million
dollars are with us ceasing to be noticeable. We already have citizens
whose wealth can be estimated only in hundreds of millions, and before
the end of the century, if present tendencies continue, we are likely
to have fortunes estimated in thousands of millions &#8211; such monstrous
fortunes as the world has never seen since the growth of similar
fortunes ate out the heart of Rome. And the necessary correlative of
the growth of such fortunes is the impoverishment and loss of
independence on the part of the masses. These great aggregations of
wealth are like great trees, which strike deep roots and spread wide
branches, and which, by sucking up the moisture from the soil and
intercepting the sunshine, stunt and kill the vegetation around them.
When a capital of a million dollars comes into competition with
capitals of thousands of dollars, the smaller capitalists must be
driven out of the business or destroyed. With great capital nothing can
compete save great capital. Hence, every aggregation of wealth
increases the tendency to the aggregation of wealth, and decreases the
possibility of the employee ever becoming more than an employee,
compelling him to compete with his fellows as to who will work cheapest
for the great capitalist&#8211;a competition that can have but one result,
that of forcing wages to the minimum at which the supply of labor can
be kept up. Where we are is not so important as in what direction we
are going, and in the United States all tendencies are clearly in this
direction. A while ago, and any journeyman shoemaker could set up in
business for himself with the savings of a few months. But now the
operative shoemaker could not in a lifetime save enough from his wages
to go into business for himself. And, now that great capital has
entered agriculture, it must be with the same results. The large
farmer, who can buy the latest machinery at the lowest cash prices and
use it to the best advantage, who can run a straight furrow for miles,
who can make special rates with railroad companies, take advantage of
the market, and sell in large lots for the least commission, must drive
out the small farmer of the early American type just as the shoe
factory has driven out the journeyman shoemaker. And this is going on
today.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is nothing unnatural in
this. On the contrary, it is in the highest degree natural. Social
development is in accordance with certain immutable laws. And the law
of development, whether it be the development of a solar system, of the
tiniest organism, or of a human society, is the law of integration. It
is in obedience to this law &#8211; a law evidently as all &#8211; compelling as
the law of gravitation &#8211; that these new agencies, which so powerfully
stimulate social growth, tend to the specialization and interdependence
of industry. </span>It is in obedience to this law that the factory is
superseding the independent mechanic, the large farm is swallowing up
the little one, the big store shutting up the small one, that
corporations are arising that dwarf the State, and that population
tends more and more to concentrate in cities. Men must work together in
larger and in more closely related groups. Production must be on a
greater scale. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The only question is,
whether the relation in which men are thus drawn together and compelled
to act together shall be the natural relation of interdependence in
equality, or the unnatural relation of dependence upon a master.</span>
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>If the one, then may civilization advance in what is
evidently the natural order, each step leading to a higher step. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If the other, then what Nature has intended as a blessing
becomes a curse, and a condition of inequality is produced which will
inevitably destroy civilization. Every new invention but hastens the
catastrophe.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, all this we may deduce from
natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of gravitation. And all
this we may see going on today. This is the reason why modern progress,
great as it has been, fails to relieve poverty; this is the secret of
the increasing discontent which pervades every civilized country. Under
present conditions, with land treated as private property, material
progress is developing two diverse tendencies, two opposing currents. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>On the one side, the tendency of increasing population and
of all improvement in the arts of production is to build up enormous
fortunes, to wipe out the intermediate classes, and to crowd down the
masses to a level of lower wages and greater dependence. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>On the other hand, by bringing men closer together, by
stimulating thought, by creating new wants, by arousing new ambitions,
the tendency of modern progress is to make the masses discontented with
their condition, to feel bitterly its injustice. The result can be
predicted just as certainly as the result can be predicted when two
trains are rushing toward each other on the same track.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This thing is absolutely certain:<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Private property in land blocks the way of
advancing civilization.</span>&nbsp; </small>The two cannot long coexist. Either
private property in land must be abolished, or, as has happened again and again
in the history of
mankind, civilization must again turn back in anarchy and bloodshed.
Let the remaining years of the nineteenth century bear me witness. Even
now, I believe, the inevitable struggle has begun. It is not
conservatism which would ignore such a tremendous fact. It is the
blindness that invites destruction. He that is truly conservative let
him look the facts in the face; let him speak frankly and
dispassionately. This is the duty of the hour. For, when a great social
question presses for settlement, it is only for a little while that the
voice of Reason can be heard. The masses of men hardly think at any
time. It is difficult even in sober moments to get them to reason
calmly. But when passion is roused, then they are like a herd of
stampeded bulls. I do not fear that present social adjustments can
continue. That is impossible. What I fear is that the dams may hold
till the flood rises to fury. What I fear is that dogged resistance on
the one side may kindle a passionate sense of wrong on the other. What
I fear are the demagogues and the accidents.<small>... <a style="font-weight: bold;"
