      Share of Urban Real Estate Value</span>  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Urban land is far more valuable than
  rural land, a fact most of us don't realize and whose huge significance we
    may tend to gloss over. It has the power to either solve our social problems
    or create them, depending on who benefits from it.</p>
  <p>Very
    briefly, an acre of decent agricultural land in Vermont might sell for $2,500.
    (In the
    midwest,
    agricultural
    land values
    are
    somewhat lower.)&nbsp; An
    acre
    in
    midtown
    Manhattan
    can
    sell for over $250,000,000 &#8212; on those rare occasions when a landholder
    puts it on the market &#8212; with or without a building on it.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
    difference is a ratio of 1:100,000!</span>&nbsp; And as population
    increases and social and technological progress continues, that ratio
    will rise.</p>
  <p>A May, 2006, Federal Reserve Board study found that in the top 46 metro
    markets, land accounted for, on average, 50.9% of the value of single-family
    housing stock, in 2004. The study reported that in the remainder of the country,
    the corresponding value, for 2000, was about 27%. The 50.9% figure ranged
    from a low of 23.3% in Oklahoma City to a high of 88.5% in the San Francisco
    metro. <font size="-1">(source:</font> <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200625/index.html">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200625/index.html</a><font size="-1">)</font><br>
      <br>
      What makes a New York City condominium valuable is not primarily the
      amenities the unit itself provides, or the building offers, but its
      location.&nbsp; Locational values may exceed 95% of the total selling
      price.&nbsp; What makes a floor in a New York City office building
      valuable is not its amenities or furnishings, but its location.&nbsp;
      Those same amenities would rent for a tiny fraction of their Manhattan
      value even 10 miles away (and sometimes as little as a few blocks away).&nbsp; It
      is the population, the transportation system, the active marketplace and
      other <em>publicly
      created</em> factors that give the site its value. </p>
  <p>A 40-story condominium or office building is an effective way of sharing
    a scarce resource: urban land.&nbsp; But even a new  40-story building with
    a lot of amenities may not be worth as much as the land on which it sits,
    if the central business district is healthy.&nbsp; An
    older building may be worth a tiny fraction of what the land is worth, and
    may even have a negative worth: it costs money to tear it down and remove
  the rubble, restoring the site to readiness for a new structure.</p>
  <p>What are the implications of this? When a tenant pays a landlord for occupancy,
    a significant fraction of what he is paying for is not the structure or the
    services the landlord provides, but the location itself.&nbsp; The services
    the city provides (subways, buses, paved streets, water, sewer, emergency
    services, commuter trains, airports, etc) and the population that can reach
    that site are what give the site value.&nbsp; And yet it is the landlord
    who gets to collect the tenants' money month by month, and, when he/it is
    ready to sell, it is the landholder who profits from the appreciation of
    the site.&nbsp; What kind of sense does this make?&nbsp; What does it mean
    to our distribution of wealth and income in this country?&nbsp; What sort
    of leverage does this give the owners of those sites, and our other valuable
    resources (e.g., taxi medallions, radio and tv channels, wireless spectrum,
    water and reservoir lands, etc.)?&nbsp; Each of these is part of the natural
    or societal creation, and yet we permit the privatization of what should
    be common resources.&nbsp; The &quot;ownership society&quot; concept encourages
    each of us to believe that the nibbles we can afford at the edges are our
    fair share of the economy.&nbsp; But to achieve fairness, a far better way
    would be to collect the land rent -- the value of all the sites and spectrum
    and other things we all rely on -- from those who seek to use them, based
    on predictably scheduled auctions -- and use that as the basis of our common
    spending, which helps to provide the subways, buses, paved streets, water,
    sewer, emergency services, railroads, airports, etc), rather than taxing
    our buildings (1%), our sales (6-11%), our wages and other income (15% to
    39% of some portion of it, subject to shelters and evasion).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leona
    Helmsley, the Manhattan real estate magnate, said it clearly, though most
    of us misunderstood the significance of what she said: <em>We</em> don't
    pay taxes.&nbsp; The
    little people pay taxes.  </p>
  <p>Lest we think that urban land values have only recently become significantly
    higher than rural land values, consider that over 125 years ago, Henry George
    noted the huge difference, and ultimately made the connection
    between poverty and urban land values, which led to his first book, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress
    &amp; Poverty.</em></a>&nbsp; Even in his day, he noted that there were properties
    whose  value was over $1,000,000 per acre (see, for example, <a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The
    Single Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a>).  And $1,000,000 then &#8212;    the
    1880s &#8212; was worth a lot more than $1,000,000 is today!</p>
  <p><strong>The return that goes to the landholder is not available for labor
      or capital, and by definition depresses economic activity.</strong> The alternative, collecting
    for the commons much or all of the return that goes to land, and using it
    as the basis for public spending &#8212; instead of sales taxes or wage taxes &#8212; would
    lower the <em>price </em>of land, and permit labor and capital to get their
    just return in the form of wages and interest. This would promote equity,
    justice and saving, instead of promoting speculation in land.</p>

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The owner of city land takes, in
the rents he receives for his
land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does the owner of
farming land. And whether he be working in a garret ten stories above
the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet below the earth's
surface, it is the competition for the use of land that ultimately
determines what proportion of the produce of his labor the laborer will
get for himself. This is the reason why modern progress does not tend
to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why, with all the inventions
and improvements and economies which so enormously increase productive
power, wages everywhere tend to the minimum of a bare living. The cause
that in Ireland produces poverty and distress &#8211; the ownership by some
of the people of the land on which and from which the whole people must
live &#8211; everywhere else produces the same results. It is this that
produces the hideous squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this
that makes want jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that
forces little children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts
mills, and that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps.</small><small>... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/the_crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty&nbsp;</a> (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am talking too long; but let
me in a few words point out the way of
getting rid of land monopoly, securing the right of all to the elements
which are necessary for life. We could not divide the land. In a rude
state of society, as among the ancient Hebrews, giving each family its
lot and making it inalienable we might secure something like equality.
But in a complex civilisation that will not suffice. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is not, however, necessary to divide up
the land. All that is necessary is to divide up the income that comes
from the land.</span> In that way we can secure absolute equality; nor
could the adoption of this principle involve any rude shock or violent
change. It can be brought about gradually and easily by abolishing
taxes that now rest upon capital, labour and improvements, and raising
all our public revenues by the taxation of land values; and the longer
you think of it the clearer you will see that in every possible way
will it be a benefit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, supposing we should abolish all other taxes direct and
indirect, substituting for them a tax upon land values, what would be
the effect? </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In the first place it would be to kill speculative values.
It would be to remove from the newer parts of the country the bulk of
the taxation and put it on the richer parts. It would be to exempt the
pioneer from taxation and make the larger cities pay more of it. It
would be to relieve energy and enterprise, capital and labour, from all
those burdens that now bear upon them. What a start that would give to
production! <br>
    </small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>In the second place we could,
from the value of the land, not merely pay all the present expenses of
the government, but we could do infinitely more. In the city of San
Francisco James Lick left a few blocks of ground to be used for public
purposes there, and the rent amounts to so much, that out of it will be
built the largest telescope in the world, large public baths and other
public buildings, and various costly works. If, instead of these few
blocks, the whole value of the land upon which the city is built had
accrued to San Francisco what could she not do?&nbsp; ... <a

</ul>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in
this world, and in our civilization. There is a provision made by the
laws of the Creator which would secure to the helpless all that they
require, which would give enough and more than enough for all social
purposes. These little children that are dying in our crowded districts
for want of room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a
great estate.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Did you ever consider the full
meaning of the significant fact that as progress goes on, as population
increases and civilization develops, the one thing that ever increases
in value is land?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">there
the speculator jumps in, land rises in value, and a great boom takes
place, and people find themselves enormously rich without ever having
done a single thing to produce wealth.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that land steadily
increases in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to
it; that the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s
goodness in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use
adds to the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This
natural fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law
of the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is the intent of this natural law of increasing land
values? Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land
values grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to society as a whole, with which we
may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with which we may meet
public expenses, and do all the things that an advancing civilization
makes more and more necessary for society to do on behalf of its
members?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today the value of land in New
York city is over a hundred million annually.</span> Who has created
that value? Is it because a few landowners are here that that land is
worth a hundred million a year? Is it not because the whole population
of New York is here? Is it not because this great city is the center of
exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every child
that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some
portion of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being
used for that purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to
appropriate the fund of land values?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production. ...&nbsp;<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/George_TSNS.html"> <span

</a>Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever there
is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a great
city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the bounty

well, or a gas deposit, </div>
<p>Mason Gaffney: <a

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature of
        land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic base
        of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder
        than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
        land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any city,
        so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold. They like
        the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
        surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land is what
        yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
        by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,
        the absentee owners consist of former residents, or their heirs, who
        grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.</b></small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your balance
      of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees, money that used
      to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury
      to pay your local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders
      and building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
      the value of its own base.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The size of rent is not
reported
in capitalist nations,
except to trivialize it. Their national accountants, dominated by
landowners, neglect or conceal it artfully, to protect it from being
taxed. Local governments do, however, measure and tax property by
value. More than half the value of property is land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In Vancouver,
B.C., 73% of the value of all property assessed for taxation is land,
even though much land there is exempt from tax, and not assessed at
all. In California's major cities it would be just as high if only we
assessed land here as accurately as they do there. </span><a

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What Affordable
Housing Problem?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like all creatures --
goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Why do those statistics not seem to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The
answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
In contrast to those 11- to 14-percent annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three
decades.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A close friend in
Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed
here will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
subsidies. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In Conclusion, I have tried to show that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values. </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have here data ... I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling
a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When
the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State
Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location? ...<b>
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"How about corporate
stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt corporate wealth from the property
tax?" Actually, almost all jurisdictions already exempt stock and all
other "intangible" property. Not to worry, however, you tax corporate
assets. When you rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten
on most tax rolls are all corporations. None of their multi-national
profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and creative
transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your assessor's
maps. This makes sense anyway. Why should you think you can tax a
corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you is its
property in your town. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In other cases, industries occupy land of high value that is
wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it has
not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias of
assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to improved
"lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of wholesale
discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis, Wisconsin, the southwest
corner of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
100% location, the most valuable commercial site in town. That land,
with the same retail potential as the other three corners, is assessed
as raw industrial acreage, as though it were in the boonies, with no
recognition of its high location value for retail/office use. To make a
land tax work, the assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at
its highest and best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting
buildings would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very
problem that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this point.
You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are public
records, and you know your own town. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;"Hold on once more," I hear, "not so fast, how about the
mansions of rich people?" Another fair question: how, indeed, can you
justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish you. Here
are some data from British Columbia that speak to the point. They are
from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland") and the southern
part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where over half the people
in the province live. B.C. practices high quality professional
assessment; data from its rolls are quite reliable, as such things go.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;Cities and districts around Vancouver and Victoria are
ranked, in Table 1, according to the land value per property
(single-family residences). These range from nearly $700,000 each in
the "University Endowment Lands" district (very posh), to around
$40,000 each in the "Victoria Rural" district (more modest). The last
column, LSREV (Land Share of Real Estate Value), shows the land value
(L) as a share of the total value (B+L). </small><br>
<br>
<small>These shares range from a high of 80% on the<b> University
Endowment Lands (UEL)</b> down to 38% in Colwood (the lowest), and
39% in Victoria Rural (next to lowest). In between, the numbers
follow the trend closely. The dearer the land parcels, the higher is
the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">average house (ex
land)</span> in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.8 times </span>the
average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9). 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">average land parcel
(ex building)</span> in the UEL is
worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">17.5 times</span> the average
in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. Seldom will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;What do those data tell us?
The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable.</b> The rich put a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive. ...&nbsp; </b><a

Lindy Davies: <a href="../docs/Davies_Cat_NYC.html">The Cat in New York</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When I taught at the <a
 href="http://www.henrygeorgeschool.org/">Henry George School in New
York</a>, our
Director, George Collins, used to give a stirring graduation speech
to students. He told them they would find that the gift of insight
they'd been given, in studying Georgist political economy, was also a
kind of curse: they would never look upon their city with the same
eyes. The land question and its ramifications, the malignant
absurdities of today's economic systems and the sheer obviousness of
the remedy, would shout at them in every day's news.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I was reminded of that when I
recently visited New York. We stayed
with cousins in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which is by all accounts one of
the sanest and most pleasant neighborhoods in the city. Things were
still running there: the coffee shops, the restaurants, Prospect
Park, the Library, the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Well, now, in the
Park, actually, the zoo was about to close because of budget cuts;
the Mayor had suggested that devotees of the zoo should perhaps
secure sources of private funding to keep it open. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists note in this budget
crunch, as in others the city has
faced, a curious disconnect between the fiscal crisis and the overall
economy. Tax receipts are way down and the budget outlook is indeed
scary, even while the underlying economy actually lurches toward
recovery. If it weren't for the large declines in the (admittedly,
very important) financial and tourism sectors, the city's economy
would not be performing badly at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How
unfortunate, then, that New
York will see no other alternative than to choke off economic
recovery by raising income and sales taxes while cutting back on
public services. But what can they do? The tax base is declining.</span></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or is it? It
turns out that land values in New York, while
modestly down in some areas, have not taken anywhere near the beating
that the Stock Market has, or the small business community, or public
services. No, the real estate market in New York City remains, all in
all, quite bullish. There are few bargains to be had. Residential
rents, of course, having been held artificially low by rent
stabilization, provide no relief even in a weak market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, no -- despite the dire
warnings, New York City need not endure
a fiscal crisis. Its tax base -- properly defined -- is robustly
capable of providing for public needs, while actually bringing
business into the city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They have
just been taxing the wrong things,
all along. Tourists, bulls and bears come and go, but New York City's
land values -- like its citizens -- are quite resilient.&nbsp; <a

Nic Tideman:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html">The Case
for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>David Ricardo defined land, memorably, as &#8216;the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.&#8217;&nbsp; This definition is overly
narrow.&nbsp; It would exclude from land such valuable and
destruc&shy;tible things as minerals and topsoil. Ricardo&#8217;s definition
even suggests that the value of land arising from urban locations might
not be included in &#8216;land,&#8217; since it would not necessarily qualify as a
&#8216;power of the soil.&#8217;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The definition of land that is most useful in economic theory is
that
land is all scarce factors of production other than people and the
products of human effort. Land is the gifts of nature.&nbsp; Thus land
includes both rural and urban territory, mineral resources, water, fish
in oceans and rivers, virgin forests, geosynchronous orbits and the
frequency spectrum.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>With urban land there is a different type of interdependency
between
use at one time and the potential flow of services at another.&nbsp; To
be used most productively, urban land must be combined with durable,
immobile capital.&nbsp; Therefore an increase in the intensity of urban
land use often requires the destruction of previous capital
investments.&nbsp; This intertemporal dependence means that, in
principle, a forecast of all future economic conditions is needed to
know what use of land is best today.&nbsp; Since people make different
forecasts, they reach different conclusions about what use of land is
best today.&nbsp; Only with the passage of time, if at all, is it
possi&shy;ble to know what use of land would have been best.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means
that care
must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp;
There is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount of
money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp;
How&shy;ever, this formulation is not always useful for defining the
rent of land over a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor
spends a year and &pound;20 million erecting a building that is
expected to last for 30 years, what was the rent of the land under the
building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It is not sensible to
say that, if the best possible use of the land produces a negative cash
flow over a given interval of time, then land has no rental value over
that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the decision to
construct the structure was optimal, the finished building would have a
value that was greater than its cost of construction by the rent of the
land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction costs and
land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision is made,
that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does not depend on
when
construction hap&shy;pens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the rent of
land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask,
&#8216;Suppose that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp;
Perhaps by that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21
million building rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one
developed the most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to
the constraint that the land be left vacant for the first year, how
much lower would the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer
to this question, the loss of the present value of net returns from
postponing use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for
the year.&nbsp; This is the amount of money that one would need to get
in net returns from some pre-existing use to justify postponing
redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus the rent of land for any developed
site, for any year, is defined to be the answer to the question, &#8216;If
this site were undevel&shy;oped, what would be the cost of leaving
undeveloped and unused for a year?&#8217;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land also differs from labor and capital in the origin of claims
to own
it.&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Labor can be defined as the factors of production that own
themselves.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of capital is derived originally from
organizing its production and paying the various factors that are
employed to produce it.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of land, by contrast, derives
from rights of exclusive use and access that are granted by governments.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ownership of land is thus a form
of privilege.&nbsp; The word
&#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it, that is,
a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted to
do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be
&#8216;owned&#8217;, but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;, subject to a payment that
reflected the value given up by others in allowing one person to have
exclusive use of a site. ...<a href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html"> Read

Nic Tideman:<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"> Using
Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<small>... Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.

</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Might the PTS fall heavily on low-income land
holders and elderly homeowners? The land-rich, money-poor old widow
could suffer if society were to levy sites. Eventho' the vast majority
of poor people would come out ahead, there probably will be the rare
exception. To deal with "the widow on a valuable lot", the new policy
could include deferments<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as some poor could pay more, some
rich could pay less, such as the
owners of a skyscraper that'd be the highest (literally) and best use
of a site. While a PTS could be a tax break for a few, the intent of
the shift is not so much to whittle away fortunes as it is to promote
prosperity, equity, and sustainability.</span> Were society to attain
such
goals, letting some fortunes escape unscathed is a small price to pay.
Also, putting a site to best use, while profitable, also benefits the
community by providing convenient employment, bringing money into the
local economy, and by precluding less efficient development, such as
sprawl. </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Since the shift is progressive, then the rich are
footing the bill for
everyone else. To answer this charge that one group will pay more
(those who can afford it), proponents could note that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the amount one
pays is scaled according to the value of what one takes -- a parcel of
nature. The payment is for exclusive use to our common heritage. Those
who exclude the rest from the best must expect to pay the most. </span>...
</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span

our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and

<p>Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The steep increase in the level of
rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79
or by
160%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>During the same period median urban family income rose
from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions....</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage.</small><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be
desired.
Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
tax bill will be.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small><br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. <br>
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The reform of our property tax system must be regarded as one of
the
most urgent and important task we face today.&nbsp; ...<small><small><big><big><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Society pays a price for not
adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings, the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations, they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</small></div>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>The
railway. . . was capable of accepting and disgorging
its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This
being the case, it tended to gather together, and to concentrate around
its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that was in any way
related to movements of freight or passengers into or out of the city.
It was in this quality that it had made major and in some ways decisive
contributions to the development not only of the great railway
metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such inland cities as
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of the great
maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The automobile, on the other hand,
had precisely the opposite
qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>II. What is
waste, and what should we do about it?</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are all against wasting
resources: wonderful - but what is
waste? In answering, I will deal with two cognate questions.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We agree, we should combat waste with a family of green
taxes,
but what green taxes? When, and where, and why?</small></li>
  <li><small>We agree on containing sprawl, but should we stress
repelling
people from designated green areas, or attracting them to designated
human habitats?</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. What is waste?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question has been faced
before. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gifford
Pinchot</span> was a leader
with a magic name in the U.S.A. during the early conservation era. He
answered well for his times and, I submit, for ours too.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"... natural resources must be developed and
preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country which belongs to us all."</small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He did not say just "preserved;"
he said "developed and
preserved." Today I suspect he would say "REdevelop," to get away
from the negative baggage carried by "develop;" I certainly will.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pinchot went on:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"The first principle of conservation is
development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes (he mentions water for power and
transportation) for all the exhaustible natural resources, ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
    <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the
prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
    <small> </small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, like
everyone, but he gives it a new
turn (or, rather, an old turn that many have forgotten). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To him,
WASTE MEANS FAILING TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES</span>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Urban land makes
a
good example. Urban land, economically speaking, is a lot like
falling water, strange as it seems. Economists (who are not all bad)
classify urban land as a "flow resource." </span>They liken it to
flowing
water because its services perish with time, whether used or not -
and we are trapped in the one-way flow of time. It is an even better
example of a "flow resource" than water itself, because unused water
may have other uses downstream. Even in wasting out through
California's Golden Gate, fresh water repels salinity. The unreaped
harvests of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the
Golden Gate of time like lost loves, and magic moments that passed us
by. The waste of NOT using flow resources is just as real as the
waste of misusing exhaustible resources. Indeed, when we tote up the
transportation costs of disintegrated urban settlement patterns, it
is clear that failure to use good urban land is a major cause of
wasting energy.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html"><span

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">Economics in
Support of Environmentalism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>Pinchot
on "Development"</b></small></small></small>
</small><br>
<small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The first principle of
conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in

for the use of substitutes for all the exhaustible natural resources,
... (water power and water transportation are his examples). ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
  <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention
of
waste. ... "</small></p>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, using good central land saves all the costs of
settling
on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of

by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it. To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George is largely remembered for
the single tax. But the single
tax came at the end of a long trail as a means &#8212; <i>the</i> means,
he said &#8212; by which to remedy ills previously identified and
diagnosed. Behind the single tax lay a closely knit system of
thought. To understand George, it is necessary to go behind the
single tax and explore that system for its major characteristics.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notable in George's work is the
emphasis he laid on the relation
of man to the earth. "The most important of all the material
relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George might well be called a land
economist, indeed, the foremost
land economist. For George, the basic fact of man's physical
existence is that he is a land animal, "who can live only on and from
land, and can use other elements, such as air, sunshine and water,
only by the use of land."&nbsp; "Without either of
the three elements, land, air and water, man could not exist; but he
is peculiarly a land animal, living on its surface, and drawing from
it his supplies."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So man not only lives off land,
levying on it for its materials
and forces, but he also lives on land. His very life depends on land.
". ..land is the habitation of man, the store-house upon which he
must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be
applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products of
the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the
forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again -
children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower
of the field. Take away from man all that belongs to land, and he is
but a disembodied spirit."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land and man, in that order! These
two things are the
fundamentals. They are, for instance, the fundamentals of production.
It is said that without labor, certainly, there can be no production.
Similarly, without land, clearly there can be no agricultural
production or mining production. It was just as clear to George that
there could be no production of any kind without land. There could be
no factory production, no trade, no services rendered, and none of
the multitudinous operations of town and city. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All these processes require land:
a place, a spot, a site, a
location, so many acres or square feet of the earth's surface on
which to be performed. "In every form ...the exertion of human labor
in the production of wealth requires space; not merely standing or
resting space, but moving space -- space for the movements of the
human body and its organs, space for the storage and changing in
place of materials and tools and products. This is as true of the
tailor, the carpenter, the machinist, the merchant or the clerk, as
of the farmer or stock-grower, or of the fisherman or miner."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The office building, the store,
the bank, as well as the factory,
need land just as do the farm and mine. Land is needed as sites on
which to build structures. Likewise, businesses need land as the
locations on which to perform their subsequent operations. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George adds: "But it may be said,
as I have often heard it said,
'We do not all want land! We cannot all become farmers!' To this I
reply that we do all want land, though it may be in different ways
and in varying degrees. Without land no human being can live; without
land no human occupation can be carried on. Agriculture is not the
only use of land. It is only one of many. And just as the uppermost
story of the tallest building rests upon land as truly as the lowest,
so is the operative as truly a user of land as is the farmer. As all
wealth is in the last analysis the resultant of land and labor, so is
all production in the last analysis the expenditure of labor upon
land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad needs land, not just
for its terminals and depots but
for its very roadbeds; whoever uses the railroad uses the land that
the railroad occupies, as well as the improvements the railroad
affords. The State needs land not only for parks and reservoirs but
for schools and courts, for hospitals and prisons, and for roads and
highways with which to link its residents together. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our homes require land, whether
the home is a country estate, a
city apartment, or a room in hotel or tenement. Our diversions
require land, whether for a ride in the country, a round on the golf
course, a seat at the theatre, or a chair in the library or before
the television set. "Physically we are air-breathing, light-requiring
land animals, who for our existence and all our production require
place on the dry surface of our globe. And the fundamental perception
of the concept land -- whether in the wider use of the word as that
term of political economy signifying all that external nature offers
to the use of man, or in the narrower sense which the word usually
bears in common speech, where it signifies the solid surface of the
earth -- is that of extension; that of affording standing-place or
room." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In George's view, man's dependence
on land is universal and
endless, "...for land is the indispensible prerequisite to life."&nbsp;
"What is inexplicable, if we lose sight of
man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we
recognize it."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here then is the main element,
the distinctive characteristic, of
George's work. In George's view, man's relation to the earth is his
primary material relation. All other influences, therefore, must be
appraised as to how they affect, or are affected by, this basic
relation. It is perhaps this to which Soule refers when he says, of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, "This book expounded a theory
developed with superb logic." </small><small>...<a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">read

<p><small></small>Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">George's
Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical
resolutions and synergies
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...
It unlocks urban land markets
that are frozen up by the tendency of firms to buy and hold land for
possible future expansion. </span>This is a form of vertical
integration which, like all withholding actions, is self-reinforcing
and self-validating, hence cumulative in its impact. That is, if A and
B are tying up surplus land for their possible future needs, that
forces C, D, and E to do the same because they cannot rely on the open
market to supply the land when and if needed. <i>A fortiori</i>,
speculative preemptors who hold key parcels to profit from others
attempts to assemble buildable parcels, or to compete in key markets,
force others to do likewise in self-defense. The pooling function of
the free market is impaired. Conversely, the gains from correcting such
market failures are also self-reinforcing and cumulative, providing us
with many "free lunches." ...</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>... Adding people
and capital w/o diluting resource base</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist policy lets a region,
nation, or the world add population
and/or capital without diluting its resource base. It is as though
rescuers pulled drowning people into a lifeboat, and their presence
made the boat expand instead of sink! Call it <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"The Accommodating
Lifeboat Theorem."</span> It sounds like the Miracle of the Loaves and
Fishes, but it is a different kind of miracle: synergy. It comes
from the power of enlarging the market, as described by George in his
chapter on the effects of increased population, and Adam Smith in his
aphorism, "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the
market." An indication of it is that bigger cities around the world
have more land value per head than small ones, as documented by
William Alonso. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;We must temper this claim.
Bigger cities are often located on
better land, so size isn't all that accounts for Alonso's finding.
However, more than sheer size, and more than good natural location,
is the internal circulation of a city. Georgist policies are
essential to financing good circulation, containing sprawl, and
inducing private land development complementary to the circulatory
system. <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ideal
public policy would be to reduce taxes on production and commerce and
raise public revenue from non-distorting revenue sources.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That non-distorting revenue source
is land and natural resources.
The central problem which limits the operational success of the
economy is the failure to procure the public value which is created
by the community. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This value ought to be reserved
for the community to pay for
public improvements. However, this value is to a large extent
diverted into private pockets by speculation in land and natural
resource values. The correct approach is to create a system in which
no-one, except the citizenry as a whole, is rewarded by the
collection of publicly created values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists can agree that the
economically efficient public
finance system is one in which revenue is drawn from the rent that
people pay for the use of land and natural resources. These payments
do not distort economic activity. Land rent, because it is pure
surplus, could be taken and used for any purpose and there would be
no negative consequences for the allocation of labor and capital, or
in the use of land and natural resources. If this surplus is invested
in needed infrastructure and other public services, it will in turn
increase land values for future public investment.&nbsp; ... <a
