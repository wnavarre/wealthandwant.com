<blockquote>
  <p>The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
      shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of
    the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent,
    must,
      like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances
    through half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before
    he reaches
      the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead entry or
    pre-emption. He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is forced so much
    farther than
      he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation which is holding these
    unused lands in expectation of increased value in the future. And when he
    settles,
      he will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can use, in
    the belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow him
    are again
      forced farther on than the necessities of production require, carrying
    the margin of cultivation to still less productive, because still more remote
    points. <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">... read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial depression
      are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully solved, and the social
      phenomena which all over the civilized world appall the philanthropist and
      perplex the statesman, which hang with clouds the future of the most advanced
      races, and suggest doubts of the reality and ultimate goal of what we have
      fondly called progress, are now explained.</p>
  <p>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
      tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with increase
      in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
      constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.</p>
  <p>Land being necessary to labor, and being reduced to private ownership, every
      increase in the productive power of labor but increases rent &#8212; the
      price that labor must pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and

    <p><strong><font size="-1">4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</font></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
      <br />
  Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing
  the processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
  do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
  tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the
  payer works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes
  it, of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 25 or in lesser
  degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
  tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
  taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. I.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">25. It is common, besides taxing improvements, as fast
        as they are made, to levy higher taxes upon land when put to its best
        use than when put to partial use or to no use at all. This is upon the
        theory that when his land is used the owner gets full income from it
        and can afford to pay high taxes; but that he gets little or no income
        when the land is out of use, and so cannot afford to pay much. It is
        an absurd but perfectly legitimate illustration of the pretentious doctrine
        of taxation according to ability to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Examples are numerous. Improved building lots, and even
        those that are only plotted for improvement, are usually taxed more than
        contiguous unused and unplotted land which is equally in demand for building
        purposes and equally valuable. So coal land, iron land, oil land, and
        sugar land are as a rule taxed less as land when opened up for appropriate
        use than when lying idle or put to inferior uses, though the land value
        be the same. Any serious proposal to put land to its appropriate use
        is commonly regarded as a signal for increasing the tax upon it.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this test.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book vii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The reader who has been deceived into believing that Mr.
        George's proposition is in any respect unjust, will find profit in a
        perusal of the entire chapter from which the foregoing extract is taken.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>

  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

      Do: Share the Surplus</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs,&#8221; a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To deliver a bigger pie, the
Right
touts efficiency and growth; to better distribute the pie, the Left
urges equity and jobs. Yet jobs are less for distributing, more for
producing &#8211; if that. As automation and globalisation expand the pie,
they contract the workforce. Even </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when, or especially when, people take time
off to go to war, output increases, proving we&#8217;re well over
over-capacity. </span><span

productivity does not bless us with leisure but curses us with
unemployment.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>However, even when employment is high, jobs still do a lousy job
of
distribution. They capture less than a fair return to labor while
swallowing up our free time. Full employment with a liveable wage may
mean jobs with justice for some, but not for those unable to work, and
it reduces humans to workers, not players or creators. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding jobs rather than a

that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. There is a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing. And since

Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This means that taxing away land
rent more relieves it from circulating
through labor and capital, allowing those factors in turn to be more
productive. Significantly, perhaps most importantly, the collection of
land rent, on account of its inelasticity, incurs no deadweight loss
like tax levies on labor and capital. The economy thus functions more
efficiently -- i.e. with less drag and friction.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Lest one believe that this excess burden, or so-called
deadweight loss,
is a negligible drag on the economy, studies show just the opposite.
One study calculates that it was equal to about 20 percent of the total
US economy in the mid-1990s, annually at least one trillion dollars in
lost output.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(23)</span></small>
Put another way, a well designed efficient revenue structure would
allow productivity to rise by that amount and effectively make our
income that much higher. For Great Britain, the comparable figure was
shown to be &pound;400 billion annually.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Deadweight loss is a concept understood by economists but not by
the
general public. But this is likely to change as discussion about the
merit of various taxation approaches is presented to the public.
Nations in the European Community are now required to publish their
calculations about the deadweight loss of the various tax schemes being
reviewed, precisely because of the recognition of its importance as a
factor of production.<small><span
