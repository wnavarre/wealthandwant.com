<small>An additional ethical reason for recognizing equal rights to
natural
opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;
Nations have arisen through violence.&nbsp; While the world condemns
violence among nations, it has persistently acquiesced to regimes
established by violence.&nbsp; The greater the natural resources of a
nation, the greater is the attraction to potential tyrants of the
possibility of taking over the nation.&nbsp; If the world is able to
establish an understanding, backed up by the threat of economic
boycotts, that nations have an obligation to share the value of natural
opportunities in proportion to population, and that people are free to
leave nations that they find unacceptable, then the return to violent
appropriation of power will be removed.&nbsp; As long as we accept the
continued exercise of disproportionate power over natural opportunities
by those who acquired that power through violence, we will have
difficulty persuading potential usurpers of power that we will not
accept their conquests. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

  Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications of Land
  Value Taxation to Problems of Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient
  Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>John Locke did not advocate land value taxation. Writing in about 1690, he
    said that there was so much unclaimed land in America that no one could properly
    complain about the private appropriation of
  land in Europe.<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font> Writing nearly 200 year
  later, when it was becoming impossible for people to appropriate good unclaimed
  land in America, Henry George said: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator, we are
      all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty -- with an equal
      right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
      which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human
      being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance in the world
      can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
      thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
      make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
      to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
      who follow them.<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>George preceded this argument with a psychological and linguistic one. He
    said that our conception of property, of a right of exclusive possession, is
    based on the idea that each person has a right to his or her productive powers,
    and therefore to what he or she produces. Since no one produced land, no one
    can properly claim to own it.<font size="-1"><b><i>5</i></b></font></p>
  <p>This psychological and linguistic argument is not entirely convincing. It
    seems clear that humans, like other species, have an impulse toward the appropriation
    and defense of territory. Natural selection has worked in favor of those who
    are skilled in appropriating natural opportunities and deterring others from
    encroaching on them. It seems possible that, as a way of limiting violence,
    humans have merged an idea of ownership based on production with an idea of
    ownership based on the ability to appropriate territory and deter encroachment.</p>
  <p>If this is the social and biological reality, then there is a different argument
    for treating natural opportunities as everyone's common heritage. Realizing
    that we are participants in a game of territorial appropriation and its extension
    into the politics of special interest legislation and other manifestation of
    privilege, we should also realize that substantial gains are possible from
    ending the game of encroachment and appropriation. We might aspire to end the
    waste of effort on all forms of rent-seeking and on defense against rent-seeking.
    But our efforts to end the game have been based primarily on enshrining the
    status quo: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The last successful appropriator gets to keep what
    has been appropriated. This deference to power might be considered simply realistic.
    However, it has a high cost.</span> The practice of legitimating successful
    past appropriations -- as when the world declines to challenge Indonesia's
    1976 annexation of East Timor, or when any number of dictators become recognized
    as the rightful heads of nations -- induces selfish egoists to calculate
    that if they can grab something and hang on to it long enough for the expected
    furor
    to subside, then it will be regarded as just as legitimately theirs as North
    America is regarded as the legitimate property of the descendants of European
    settlers rather than the previously occupying natives. (And of course, in
    many cases those previously occupying natives had forcibly displaced earlier
    occupants.)
    A statement of the form, "No appropriation before year X will be questioned,
    but all aggressive appropriations after year X will be overturned," is not
    credible. Year X keeps getting moved, and successful aggression pays.</p>
  <p>Much more credible is a statement of the form, "<b>We will share equally the
      value of natural opportunities that might be appropriated</b>." This is
      the potential of land value taxation: to provide a framework in which the
      value
      of natural opportunities will be shared equally, both as an expression
      of the idea that all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities,
      and
      as a formula whose potential to remove the motive for future aggression
      is greater than that of enshrining the status quo of any particular year.
      And
      in addition, land value taxation is one way of achieving allocative efficiency
      with respect to a wide variety of public issues.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation is usually thought of as a possible source of revenue
    for local governments. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But the ethical principle
    that supports it is most coherent when the principal is applied on a global
    basis: All persons in the world have equal rights to natural opportunities.
    This does not mean that all persons in the world have equal rights to all
    land rent. To the extent that the rent of land arises as a result of the
    provision
    of infrastructure, that rent is the natural income of the polity that provided
    the infrastructure, and the logical source for financing it. What all persons
    in the world have equal rights to is the "pre-development" rental value of
    land, the rental value that land would have to the potential developer of
    a new community if there were no community and no infrastructure. </span>To
    motivate the application of land value taxation to other areas of economic
    life, I will
    assume that there is a global agreement that, because all persons have equal
    rights to natural opportunities, there will be transfers among nations to
    equalize per capita pre-development rent. The principle behind this agreement
    is then
    extended to other issues. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read the whole article</a></p>
