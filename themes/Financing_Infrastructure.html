Infrastructure</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>When government, on our behalf, invests in infrastructure, amazing things
    happen. Land values rise. If you are in the New York metro area, think of the
    Verrazanno Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island, and of
    the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects Westchester and Rockland Counties. In
    each case, federal dollars produced huge windfalls for local landholders. If
    an infrastructure project is worth doing, it will produce increases in land
    values that exceed its cost.</p>
  <p>So, knowing that, who should pay for infrastructure, and how should the
    cost burden be shared? Does it make sense to pay for such projects through
    taxes
    on income? On sales? On buildings? Or does it make sense to impose a tax
    only on the increase in land values that the infrastructure investment creates?
    I submit
    that such a tax is both the most just option and the most logical option,
    because it doesn't impose on those who work for a living, and doesn't suppress
    job
    creation or demand.</p>
  <p>When a new commuter train line is built, shouldn't those whose land value
    increases as a consequence be the ones to pay for the cost of the construction?
    When a new highway exit increases the value of surrounding land, shouldn't
    the owners of the land be the ones to pay, in proportion to their benefit?
     It makes a lot more sense that taking a portion of people's wages, be they
    at the top or the bottom of the income spectrum, without regard for whether
    or not they own landed property or how much value they receive from the infrastructure
    as landholders.  It makes a lot more sense
    than taxing sales, which tends to burden
    the
    people
    at the
    bottom
    of
    the income
    spectrum disproportionately, especially since many lower income people own
    no land at all and thus would both pay their landlords more and then pay again
    in sales taxes, and lower income people who do own land generally own land
    that is not in the prime locations. </p>
  <p>Think about that bridge in Alaska. The cost is something like $250 million.
    Based on the assessed value of some property held by some of the family
    members of the governor, the land value of that island is something like
    $450 million. So it would only take a 50% increase in land values on the
    island (and this ignores the increase in land values on the mainland) to
    make the bridge a worthwhile investment. So. The question becomes, whose
    $250 million should be spent on this, and how should it be collected? The
    initial proposal is that it, like other pork projects, should be financed
    from income taxes imposed on individuals and corporations and estates all
    over the US. The benefit falls to the lucky folk who own property on the
    island and on the other end of the bridge, in proportion to the size and
    location of their holdings. Please explain to us why others' incomes should
    be taxed to pay for this. </p>
  <p>In your own town, are income taxes, or sales taxes, or building taxes, being
    used to pay for infrastructure investment? Where is the justice, or the logic,
    in this? How much better would your community be if those who benefited were
    those who paid? How much better use would they put the best land to? How
    many jobs would be created? </p>
  <p>How many projects on the geographic fringes would not get done, if it was
    the beneficiaries who were asked to pay for them? How might we be able to
    contain
    sprawl, and
    prevent
    the premature development of land on the fringes?</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
      2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
      particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
      by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
      for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
      3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
      withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    <p><font size="-1">13. Following is an interesting computation of the cost

        as compared with the single tax; The computation was made by James R.

    <p><font size="-1">But to ascertain the total cost to the people of Boston
        of the present system of taxation for the taxable year, beginning May
        1, 1892, there should be added to the taxes assessed upon them what it
        cost them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the use of the
        land, being the net ground rent, which I estimate at four per cent on
        the land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Total tax levy, May 1, 1892 ... ... ... ... .... ....

        found by adding to the net ground rent the taxation on land values for
        that year, being $12.90 per $1000, or 1.29 per cent added to 4 per cent
        = 5.29 per cent.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the
        present system and the single tax, for large amounts of real estate are
        exempt from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth,
        by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by charitable,
        literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount of the value
        of land so held as returned by the assessors for the year 1892 is $60,626,171.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should
        be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of the public
        burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here. There is good
        reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
        to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an indication
        of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
        October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were
        valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report) at $52,712,600.
        I believe that this represents not more than fifty per cent of their
        true market value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property
        and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think $500,000,000

  <p><strong>    <font size="-1">3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</font></strong><br />
    <br />
    To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
    service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and
    now, in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service
    in proportion to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a
    government must use land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from
    where government is poor to where it is good; neither can he carry it from
    where the benefits of good government are few or enjoyed with difficulty
    to where they are many and fully enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where
    the benefits of government are available, or forego them. And unless he buys
    or rents where they are greatest and most available he must forego them in
    degree. Consequently, if he would work or live where the benefits of government
    are available, and does not already own land there, he will be compelled
    to rent or buy at a valuation which, other things being equal, will depend
    upon the value of the government service that the site he selects enables
    him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service of government in proportion
    to its value to him. But he does not pay the public which provides the service;
    he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor government
        than in any country of better government, other things being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government. Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.<strong> But
    landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts, and
    of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and the
    benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with the
    most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their
    property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government which its
    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.</strong>18</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
        respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence and
        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
        exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
        for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
        if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down; they
        have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be 'held up'
        and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out in the spring,
        your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs, and if you walk you
        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.
        Isn't it worth a hundred and fifty dollars a year more for a building
        site here than over in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
        But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,

        it not be something like what follows?</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
        for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire department?
        Are not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world?
        Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks,
        and electric street lights, and a first class water supply? Don't you

  <p>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?<br>
    A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
      of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
      potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
      not is as yet an unimportant question. <strong>If all revenues ought to
      be raised from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other
      sources while any land value remains in private possession.</strong> Until
      land values are exhausted the taxation of labor cannot be excused.</p>
  <p>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value, how
    would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public needs?<br>
    A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
    values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth,
    are not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values
    of the state at large.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">In this particular example, the Canal
      was done by a corporation, not a government entity, but the description
      is instructive:</span><br>
      Winston Churchill: <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">The
    People's Land</a>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Now let the Manchester Ship Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling -- or an average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small>Now what had the landowner done for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for
making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy
bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in vaIue.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The shareholders and the
ratepayers </span></small><small>I have told you what happened to the
landowners. Let us see what
happened to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">shareholders </span>and
the ratepayers who found the money. The ordinary shareholders, who
subscribed eight millions, have had no dividend yet. The Corporation
loan of five millions interest on which is borne on the rates each
year, had, until 1907, no return upon its capital. A return has come at
last, and no doubt the future prospects are good; but there was a long
interval -- even for the corporation. These are the men who did the
work. These are the men who put up the money. I want to ask you a
question. Do you think it would be very unfair if the owners of all
this automatically created land value due to the growth of the city, to
the enterprise of the community, and to the sacrifices made by the
shareholders -- do you think it would have been very unfair, if they
had been made to pay a proportion, at any rate, of the unearned
increment which they secured, back to the city and the community? </small><small>...

Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
  <p>It's been an axiom of urban policy for the past half century to lament the
      plight of American cities &#8212; that they have lost their most productive
      populations, that their infrastructure is deteriorated and obsolete, that they
      contain people most in need, and that their tax base is limited. This essay
      argues that none of this needs to be so, and that municipal leaders need only
      to think &quot;outside the box&quot; as the hackneyed phrase goes, to find
      undreamed of revenue that will not only provide all the support cities
      need but enhance the economic vitality of their being by its collection.</p>
  <p>As conventionally viewed, cities not only have need for more services but
      lack the tax base on which to draw from. The services are greater in cities
      than in suburban and rural communities because that's where streets and other
      general services are the heaviest, where the schools are the greatest challenge,
      where the police and fire departments are most relied upon, where the social
      programs face the greatest pathologies, and where general administration is
      the most complex and requires the greatest control and coordination. It seems
      so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning, and no further discussion is required.</p>
  <p>At the same time, so the argument goes, the revenue bases upon which to
    levy taxes are most lacking: the middle class and the wealthier populations
    have
      largely moved out, and stores have relocated to malls and highway junctions
      taking the sales tax base with them. What's left are deteriorating buildings
      and a complaining citizenry: the footloose commercial and industrial sector
      also threatens to relocate along with a residential population feeling
    strangled by growing municipal and school taxes on real property. A few cities
    have reached
      beyond taxation of property and sales to impose one more &#8212; an income
      tax &#8212; on top of the others. And greater reliance upon user fees and
      on privatized services shifts the burden increasingly to the poor. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Typically rent collection is ignored, however, left instead in the
