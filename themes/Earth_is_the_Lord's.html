(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now imagine, when we men and
women of today go before that awful bar, that there we should behold
the spirits of those who in our time under this accursed social system
were driven into crime; of those who were starved in body and mind; of
those little children who, in this city of New York, are being sent out
of the world by thousands when they have scarcely entered it &#8212; because
they do not get food enough, nor air enough; because they are crowded
together in these tenement districts under conditions in which all
diseases rage and destroy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Supposing we are confronted with those souls, what will it avail
us to say that we individually were not responsible for their earthly
conditions? What, in the spirit of the parable of Matthew, would be the
reply from the Judgment seat? Would it not be: "I provided for them
all. The earth that I made was broad enough to give them room. The
materials that are placed in it were abundant enough for all their
needs. Did you or did you not lift up your voice against the wrong that
robbed them of their fair share in the provision made for all?"</small><small>

rest upon human laws; they have

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But who made the earth that any
man can claim such ownership of

Since the earth was not made by us, but is only a temporary dwelling
place on which one generation of men follow another; since we find
ourselves here, are manifestly here with equal permission of the
Creator, it is manifest that no one can have any exclusive right of
ownership in land, and that the rights of all men to land must be
equal and inalienable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There
must be exclusive right of possession of
land, for the man who uses it must have secure possession of land in
order to reap the products of his labor. But his right of possession
must be limited by the equal right of all, and should therefore be
conditioned upon the payment to the community by the possessor of an
equivalent for any special valuable privilege thus accorded him.&nbsp; </span>...&nbsp;

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Promised Land, like Eden, is
a place of unhindered scope in which to glorify God and manifest his
will. But it is not the Kingdom of God. It represents liberation from
external bondage -- from oppression and restricted access to material
opportunity. It is the temporal matrix within which the Kingdom may
find full expression. But it is not itself the Kingdom. Although it is
a heresy that locates this Kingdom exclusively in the afterlife or an
ethereal paradise, Jesus declared it to be "not of this world" (John
18:36) but "within" (Luke 17:21). It is no reproach to Henry George
that he lost sight of this distinction between the Promised Land and
the Kingdom of God, enraptured by his vision of a just society:</small><br style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">With
want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of jealousy and
fear that now array men against each other; with mental power loosed by
conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure; and who shall
measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? Words fail the
thought! It is the Golden Age.... It is the culmination of Christianity
-- the City of God on earth, with walls of jasper and gates of pearl!
It is the reign of the Prince of Peace!</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><br>
      <small><strong>By equalizing opportunity, political and economic liberation
  tend to draw both poor and rich into the middle class.</strong> As an expression
  of social justice, this constitutes a genuine advance, ethical as well
  as material. But it is no easy guarantee of spiritual gain.
  Middle-class traits include virtues such as industry, thrift,
  restraint, commercial and professional rectitude, but, on the other
  hand, low prudentialism, self-satisfaction, and an inclination to
  regard material well-being as a sign of righteousness. Hence, even in
  the Promised Land, what Paulo Freire calls "conscientization" (roughly,
  consciousness-raising through social commitment), emphasized and
  refined by liberation theology, must continue although in a different
  vein. The Kingdom of God will flourish only when outward liberation
  gives rise to inward liberation, a victory over the limitations of the
  bourgeois ethos.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"The Earth Is the Lord's" (Psalm 24:1). This statement tells us
  something about God. He is attached to the land and loves it. He is not
  a spiritual abstraction oblivious to the Wasteland in which we live.
  God is the maker of the world of eating and sleeping, working and
  begetting. It also tells us something of our place in this world. With
  God as the true owner of the earth, every person has a right to the
  produce which equitable usufruct yields to his or her efforts.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
  same God who established communities has also in his providence
  ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
  Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
  the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
  extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
  were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
  taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
  individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
  produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
  the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
  the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
  justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
  Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
  have a corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a
  well-nigh universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more
  sinful than are people at large, except to the degree that they
  knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation.
  Many abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system,
  it is better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
  does. The profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially
  desirable as well as in ways that are socially destructive. Let us give
  testimony to our faith that the earth is the Lord's by building a
  social order in which there are no victims. <a

    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? <strong>When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated
    in the preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident
    truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? </strong>Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>I want to tell you the story of Charles Avilla. A while back I came across
    a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the Phillipines.
One of his professors had a great concern about poverty conditions in the Phillipines,
and was taking students out to prisons where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries
in the Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were reading
the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it belong
to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't in the Bible that
so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span> In the theological
world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put this together about poverty
and what the biblical teachings were. He had a thesis to write and he was thinking
he would do something about economic justice. One of his professors thought there
would be a wealth of information from the church's early history, the first 300
years after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic railings
of the people in that early time on the rights of the land.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a few quotes from that early period.</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Nehemiah 5:11, "Restore, I pray you, to them
    this day their lands, their vineyards, their olive yards, and their houses."<br>
  <br>
  Ezekiel 33:24, "The land is given us as an inheritance."<br>
  <br>
  Ecclesiastes 5:9, "The profit of the earth is for all."<br>
  <br>
  And Isaiah 5:8, "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
  field til there be no place ..." Leviticus 25:23, "The land is mine, for you
  are strangers and sojourners with me." ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Ethical_LT.html">read the whole article</a></div>
