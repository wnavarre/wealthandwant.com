      <p>Bill Buckley (1925-2008) is among the prominent politically conservative thinkers who enthusiastically endorsed Henry George's ideas. Here are a couple of examples.</p>
      
      <div align="left"><b>William F. Buckley, Jr.: Henry George and the Single-Tax</b>
        (an interview with Brian Lamb, CSpan
          Book Notes, April 2-3,
      2000) </div>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>CALLER: Mr. Buckley, it's a pleasure to talk to you.</p>
        <p>William F. Buckley, Jr.(WFB): Thank You.</p>
        <p>CALLER: I've heard you describe yourself as a Georgist, a follower
          of Henry George, but I haven't heard much in having you promote land
          value taxation and his theories, and I'm wondering why that is the
          case.</p>
        <p>WFB: It's mostly because I'm beaten down by my right-wing
          theorists and intellectual friends. They always find something wrong
          with the Single-Tax idea. <strong>What I'm talking about Mr. Lamb is Henry
          George who said there is infinite capacity to increase capital and to
          increase labor, but none to increase land, and since wealth is a
          function of how they play against each other, land should be thought
          of as common property. The effect of this would be that if you have a
          parking lot and the Empire State Building next to it, the tax on the
          parking lot should be the same as the tax on the Empire State
          Building, because you shouldn't encourage land speculation.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Anyway I've run into tons of situations where I think the
          Single-Tax theory would be applicable. We should remember also this
          about Henry George, he was sort of co-opted by the socialists in the
          20s and the 30s, but he was not one at all. Alfred J. Nock's book on
          him makes that plain. Plus, also, he believes in only that tax. He
          believes in zero income tax.</strong></p>
        <p>You look bored (addressing Brian Lamb)!</p>
        <p>BL: No, no. As a matter of fact I was going to ask you about
          this little book ("<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Lexicon,
            A Cornucopia of Wonderful Words for the
            Inquisitive Word Lover</span>"). I'm fascinated by it. I'm going to see
          if
          you can pronounce the word,
          the-fear-of-having-peanut-butter-stuck-to-your-roof-of-your-mouth,
          This little book starts off and the fellow's name, is it Jesse
          Sheidlower?...</p>
        <p>WFB: I think so.</p>
        <p>BL: S-H-E-I-D-L-O-W-E-R? You've never read it (the Introduction
          to "The Lexicon").</p>
        <p>WFB: No. I never have.</p>
        <p>BL: (Quoting the book) "The first time I met William F. Buckley,
          we were both members of a televised panel discussing word. The
          moderator introduced me with a pop-quiz to test my credentials asked
          me to define the word..." Is it USUFRUCT?</p>
        <p>WFB: Usufruct, yeah.</p>
        <p>BL (Quoting the book) "I felt smug as I recite the right to
          enjoy another's property as long as you don't damage it. Then Mr.
          Buckley leaned into his microphone and quoted an entire paragraph on
          usufruct from the political economist, Henry George.</p>
        <p>WFB: Oh for heaven's sake!</p>
        <p>BL: And this little book has..</p>
        <p>WFB: The land belongs to those in usufruct.<br>

 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/the_land_for_the_people.html">The Land for the People</a>".<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">We start out with these two
                principles, which I think are clear and self-evident:
                <ul>
              <li>that which a man makes belongs to him and can by him be
                given or sold to anyone that he pleases. </li>
                  <li>But that which existed before man came upon the earth, that
                    which was not produced by man, but which was created by God-that
                    belongs equally to all men. </li>
                </ul>
                As no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in
                the land. As God made the land, and as we know both from natural
                perception and from revealed religion, that God the Creator is no
                respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal, so also do we
                know that He made this earth equally for all the human creatures that
                He has called to dwell upon it. We start out with this clear principle
                that as all men are here by the equal permission of the Creator, as
                they are all here under His laws equally requiring the use of land, as
                they are all here with equal right to live, so they are all here with
                equal right to the enjoyment of His bounty.<br>
                <br>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We claim that the land
                  of Ireland, like the land of every country, cannot justly belong to any
                  class, whether that class be large or small; but that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the land of Ireland, like the land of every
                    other country, justly belongs in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">usufruct </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">to the whole people of that country equally,</span> and that no man and no class of men can have any just right in the land
                  that is not equally shared by all others.</span> ...<br>
                <br>
                THESE are the plain, simple principles for which we contend, and our
                practical measure for restoring to all men of any country their equal
                rights in the land of that country is <span style="font-weight: bold;">simply
                  to abolish other taxes, to put a tax upon the value of land,
                  irrespective of the improvements, to carry that tax up as fast as we
                  can, until we absorb the full value of the land, and we say that that
                  would utterly destroy the monopoly of land and create a fund for the
                  benefit of the entire community. </span>How easy a way that is to go
                from an unjust situation like the present to an ideally just situation
                may be seen among other things in this. Where you propose to take land
                for the benefit of the whole people you are at once met by the demands
                of the landlords for compensation. Now, if you tax them, no one ever
                heard of such an idea as to compensate a people for imposing tax.<br>
                <br style="text-decoration: underline;">
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In that easy way the
                  land can again be made the property in <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">usufruct </span>of the
                  whole people, by a gentle and gradual process.</span><br>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The real estate boom is a familiar phenomenon. Most people are predicting
          that it will, if not burst, at least wilt. But the basic components aren't
          going to change, not unless we have a catastrophe of sorts, something economists
          don't feel obliged to integrate into their speculations.</p>
        <p>The components are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> a relatively wealthy community;</li>
          <li> the hard desire to own one's own house, along with the ambition to make
            it more and more comfortable and pleasing;</li>
          <li> the dependence of building sites on immediate amenities (sewage,
            power); and</li>
          <li> strategic sources of nourishment (jobs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The convenience of infinitely available land faded as urbanization brought
          on heavy dependence on elements that weren't always available to homes on the
          range. Schools and hospitals are not only useful for educating children and
          curing the infirm. They are necessary to attract affluent home buyers.</p>
        <p>Jon Gertner, writing for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, gives a useful account
          of the home-building industry. Here are some basic indices. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We have 34 million
            rented apartments at this point and 74 million owner-occupied homes. </li>
          <li>The
            pool is being fed
            <ul>
              <li>by immigrants seeking houses, </li>
              <li>by children growing and
                seeking their own homes, and </li>
              <li>by the elderly wanting a second
                house in which to vacation
                or retire. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The home-building industry has constructed
            about 13.5 million single-family
            homes since the mid-1990s.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
        <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
          The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my kids
          are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready to buy.</p>
        <p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
          matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
          kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that house
          will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot;</p>
        <p>Such data are dismaying, but perspective helps. &quot;In Britain,&quot; the
          builder explains, &quot;you pay seven times your annual income for a home;
          in the U.S. you pay three and a half.&quot; The Brits get 330 square feet per
          person in their homes; Americans, 750 square feet. But choice parts of the
          United States face &quot;build-out.&quot; Consider New Jersey. It currently
          averages 1,165 people per square mile -- denser than India (914) and Japan
          (835).</p>
        <p>And we confront, finally and inevitably, the question: What is to be done
          about it?</p>
        <p>Almost without exception, housing specialists concur, high home prices are
          owing to zoning. Twenty years ago, in many quarters of the country, one year
          would go by before the political authority would permit a developer to begin
          housing construction. In New Jersey, that interval now approaches eight years.
          Delays of that kind have the effect of shrinking the amount of land on which
          houses can be constructed. We get the inflated costs so familiar. &quot;(Some
          authorities) used sample prices from 25 areas to show that the cost of housing
          in a metropolitan area appears to be in direct correlation to its degree of
          zoning ordinances,&quot; Gertner writes.</p>
        <p>This is a politically remote source of trouble. People who have to wait for
          a zoning agency to change its conventions, regulations, traditions and idiosyncrasies
          will be very old before they acquire a new home.</p>
        <p> Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
          attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
          factor of
          land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, George was the apostle of the single tax. It aimed most directly
          at land speculators. His insights would focus now on the limitations on the
          use of land imposed by zoning. If John Jones wants an acre protecting his house,
          he is laying claim to something that cannot expand in size. Since land, in
          George's analysis, is forever limited, it must be thought of and treated as
          common property. And therefore the rental value of one acre should constitute
          a tax (the single tax) on the person who sequesters it for himself.</p>
        <p>A strong case can be made for the amenities of zoning laws. But they have
          an effect on the availability of housing, and on its cost. One result is that
          housing costs are increasing faster than inflation.</p>
        <p>But is the Henry George factor likely to be espoused in political platforms?
          It cannot happen soon because too many interests are vested in zoning laws.
          But sharp political eyes should be trained on the question, in search of a
          viable formulation designed to fight against homelessness for grandchildren
          who cannot be expected to pay the projected cost of housing.</p>

      <p><strong>William F. Buckley: Firing Line &#8212;   For Central America: A Radical Prescription (1986) &#8212; a conversation with Manuel Ayau </strong>(excerpts from <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/firing_line/BuckleyAyau.html">http://www.schalkenbach.org/firing_line/BuckleyAyau.html</a>).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose Ferdinand and  Isabella liked some bastard son and gave him three quarters of  Guatemala, is it your position that his  great-great-great-great-whatever grandchild should continue to own  three quarters of Guatemala?<br>
          <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if he has legal  title to it, yes. He will lose it. Remember, everybody has got to bid  for his own property every day if there is really a market economy. So  if they have been able to keep it that long because they have done  something about it&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Only under the  principles of Henry George. There isn&rsquo;t much upkeep in owning three  quarters of Guatemala, is there? You just own it.<br>
          <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; No, that&rsquo;s a consequence  of the redistributionist tax system. If we had a land tax, I am sure  people would not be able to hold it without&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; So you are in favor of a land tax.<br>
          <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Aha! <br>
          <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in favor of a land tax. Not a property tax, a land tax.<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Henry George land tax idea one that is taught in your university and are there a lot of disciples of it?<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we don&rsquo;t teach it as  a particular theory, but it&rsquo;s mentioned. I used to make&mdash; In my  examinations I would draw a profile of a city, one low and one high. I  would ask the students, &lsquo;Which one has the land tax and which one has  the property tax?&rsquo; to make them think of the consequences of the land  tax. Now, I don&rsquo;t agree with what I think Henry George said that this  would be the only tax.&nbsp; I also believe in other taxes.<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, he thought that  no other taxes would be necessary if you took 100 percent of the rental  value of land, but that, of course, depends upon how heavy is the  public sector obligation.<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, let me ask you this. All right now, in Taiwan it  is generally accepted, isn&rsquo;t it, that land reform worked, but that land  reform was effectuated by reimbursing the title holders in government  bonds, which were very fastidiously repaid, and then forbidding the  land buyer to own more than I think it was seven hectares or whatever  it is &mdash; i.e., he could sell it to anybody else he wanted to, but not to  somebody who already owned seven hectares. You would not approve of  that, and tell us why.<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; No. Well, first of all, the biggest landholder in Guatemala  is the government. So there is no reason to use taxpayers&rsquo; money to go  around buying land to change the owner. If Joe owns the land it must be  for some good reason that Peter hasn&rsquo;t bought it from him or outbid  him. So the governments own most of the land in Latin America. Or they  are the biggest landowners. They don&rsquo;t own most of the land, I&rsquo;m not  sure about that. But they are the biggest. So there is no reason for  the government to use taxpayers&rsquo; money to go out and buy land to then  give it to somebody else.<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, how is somebody who is bidding for land going to  accumulate the capital to buy it? Let&rsquo;s take a situation in which there  is an idle stretch of land right near you and you are a 22-year-old  trying to look after a wife and a child and the selling price of the  property is beyond your reach. Who is supposed to give you credit to  buy it?<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp;&nbsp; You would probably have to work a few years to get enough  money to become a farmer if you are not a farmer already, if you don&rsquo;t  own anything. My own experience&mdash;<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Is it possible to save in Guatemala?<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp; Of course.<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Even given what you talk about the level of income&mdash; It&rsquo;s what, four or five hundred dollars a year?<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s more than that, but it&rsquo;s very low, I don&rsquo;t question  that. But what I think of land reform, and this is an important point,  is that those people that propose it should give the land to  beneficiaries without any strings and this they will never do. They  always claim to be paternalistic. They know that if they give the  recipients of land clear titles, the pattern will revert to a market  pattern, and this is what they are really against. They&rsquo;re more against  that than anything else. To them, land reform is an end in itself.<br>
  <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Well now, what is it that you have specific reference to?  That once you acquire title to a land and elect to sell your parcel of  land to a larger land owner, the dogmatists object to that transaction.  Why?<br>
  <br>
          MR. AYAU:&nbsp; Because what they want is a  different pattern of ownership. What they want is more equal  distribution of land &mdash; not a better distribution, not a more productive  distribution, but a more equal distribution. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re after.  They think that&rsquo;s better.<br>

      <p><strong>William F. Buckley: Firing Line &#8212;   Has New York Let Us Down?(1985) &#8212; a conversation with Roger Starr and Mark Green  </strong>(excerpts from <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/firing_line/BuckleyAyau.html"> http://www.schalkenbach.org/firing_line/BuckleyStarr.html </a>).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> I should like to begin by asking Mr. Starr to talk about housing for awhile. What does a couple need to pay in order to rent in midtown Manhattan a two-bedroom apartment?<br>
          <br>
MR. STARR:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as of yesterday afternoon, I would guess that it&rsquo;s around $2,500 minimum.<br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; How can they afford it?<br>
<br>
MR. STARR:&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t afford it unless some business is paying it on  their behalf, or unless they happen recently to have broken the bank at  Monte Carlo or come into some other source of money. It&rsquo;s a terrible  situation that we have here.<br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Well, now, don&rsquo;t terrible situations of that kind have to  come to a head? That is to say, by laws that govern all economic  activity, either people stop coming to New York or&nbsp; else more  apartments become available.<br>
<br>
MR. STARR:&nbsp; Well, my great fear is one, that this will discourage  precisely the people we need to come to New York to entrepreneurial  roles or leadership roles in the headquarters activities which now  constitute our main economic activity here. If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, we  may suddenly have a decline in demand due to the fact that people will  move out, that people who are living here just will be unable to afford  my more and will move somewhere else. And of course we an artificial  restraint on the market due to rent control, which means that nobody is  likely to build a rental apartment house anywhere in New York City  because of the fear that government is going to place an arbitrary  limit on the extent to which rents can be raised to cover costs and so  on.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; I think in one of your  other books I read that the average American allots approximately 18-20  percent of his income for housing. Is that correct?<br>
<br>
MR STARR: Well, it&rsquo;s probably a little more today. Probably up around 20-22 percent.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY: Well, roughly speaking, though, I&rsquo;d figure you&rsquo;d have to  make about $130,000 to&nbsp; maintain that ratio if you were paying $2500 a  month.<br>
<br>
MR STARR: And don&rsquo;t forget the taxes come off the top and you get no tax benefits.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; And no deductibility.<br>
<br>
MR STARR: Oh, well, deductibility is going to be a very serious problem&mdash;a very serious problem.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, let&rsquo;s explore this  problem profoundly, which you do in your book. <strong>But you disappoint me by  having one reference to Henry George, and rather tendential,  actually &mdash; about how Henry George, well a priest who advocated Henry  George was excommunicated for doing&nbsp; so. Why don't you first of all  tell us who Henry George was and what his great thesis was, because I  belong to that small band that continue to think that it is enduringly  useful.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
MR STARR:&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I agree with you very  much. In fact, I won an award from the Henry George Institute last year.  Henry George was an American of a rather patrician family, as I  remember.<br>
<br>
<strong>He developed the theory that the  ultimate form of wealth was land, and primarily the locational value of  land rather than ability to produce crops or its mineral resources.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Excuse me. I don&rsquo;t think  he said the ultimate of wealth, did he? As I remember, what he said was  the ultimate form of extortionate wealth, because tools are also a form  of wealth and labor was also a form of wealth, but you could always  have more tools and always have more labor, but couldn&rsquo;t have more land.<br>
</strong><br>
MR STARR:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true. When I say  ultimate, what I mean is nothing can take place economically without  being based on land. And you could, depending on the kind of enterprise  you&rsquo;re in, you could dispense with sewing with a sewing machine or a  shovel or whatnot, but land you absolutely must have. And that  therefore, <strong>if one taxed adequately &mdash; if government taxed adequately &mdash; the  locational value of land, it was his theory that it would need no other  taxes, and that by taxing the locational value of land, you would  encourage people to develop the land, to improve the land, to build  housing on the land, because this would not increase their taxes, but  it would increase their return, and therefore, development would be  encouraged very strongly.</strong><br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Okay, now if Georgist principles applied in New York, what would happen&nbsp; to existing relations of economic value?<br>
<br>
MR. STARR:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it would seem to  me that the central section of the city would be built up under much  greater density even than it is today, and that the exterior sections  of the city would also be built up, because building on cheap land  would not be punished the way it is today. If you buy a piece of land  for $15,000 and put up an $85,000 house, you now have to pay taxes on  $100,000 in valuation, whereas under the George theory, if all  improvements were exempt from tax, you would still pay tax on the  $15,000, so you would be encouraged to improve land of very low value,  or relatively low value. I think it would be a tremendous help.<br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY: As I remember, a glaring  example of this took place when the Seagram building decided as an act  of public courtesy to leave a certain amount of blank space in front of  their building so that people could stroll through a mini-park there  and sit down, for which they had to pay a most terrible penalty, as I  remember, because the assessor said that in effect they were really  improving their own land. <br>
<br>
MR STARR:&nbsp; The assessor said that  they were economic creatures and that they wouldn&rsquo;t have left this land  fallow, if you will, economically fallow, if it didn&rsquo;t increase the  value to them of this beautiful building.<br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<br>
MR. STARR:&nbsp; And therefore, its advertising value became part of its  constructional value and it was assessed. But I think that they finally  won in the court of appeals. I don&rsquo;t remember what the final verdict&mdash;&mdash;<br>
<br>
MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Yes, it got lost in one of those judicial mists, I think.  <strong>But in any event, if Henry George&rsquo;s principles were introduced here,  two things would happen, as I understood you. Number one, there would  be a greater density of building in midtown Manhattan; number two,  investors would be prepared to reclaim land because it would become  economically viable to build on it knowing that they wouldn&rsquo;t instantly  be taxed out of existence, right?<br>
</strong><br>
MR STARR: Right.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br>
<br>
MR STARR: Now, we developed some laws to sort of make up for our  stupidity in not adopting the Georgean theory. We have laws with  cabalistic names like J-51 and 421-A, which in effect exempt new  construction or rehabilitation from taxes, and they've caused a great  deal of conflict because one always argues over whether construction  would have taken place without this form of assistance.<br>
<br>
MR BUCKLEY:&nbsp; Enterprise zones and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
MR STARR:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, and Henry George  would have eliminated all of that and it would have been natural to  exempt improvements from taxation and the whole system of penalizing  someone for improving his property would have come to an end. <span class="style1">...</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MR. GREEN:&nbsp;&nbsp; ...  Let me ask Mr. Buckley a question about &mdash; do we have time?&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; We have two and a half minutes.<br>
          <br>
          MR. GREEN:&nbsp;&nbsp; You criticized so-called progressives &mdash; that&rsquo;s your phrase  &mdash; who are upset that there are giveaways to developers, arguing that  the developers would have done it anyway, and your point, a well-taken  one, is "Who knows?"&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you think there are sometimes  giveaways? A waste of scarce tax revenues to people who would otherwise  develop. Let me put it to Mr. Buckley and then ask you to comment.  There is a thing called bidding for business. You and I would agree  that product competition is terrific &mdash; lower price, higher quality.  What do you think? You are a free market-oriented person. What do you  think about location competition? Corporations are mobile, they can go  around the country; cities are static, and when corporations play those  cities and demand what could be called pejoratively tribute to move  into your city, I think with the result that cities have to pay more  tribute with taxpayer subsidies to get businesses to come in. There is  a net loss to the economy. There are no more jobs created, because they  have to locate somewhere. Do you think this city has been occasionally  guilty of giveaways to companies to locate here and that this doesn&rsquo;t  help the economy?<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this city has been occasionally guilty of everything, Just to begin with. In  the second place, <strong>the locational problem is, of course, easily solved  by any Georgist, and I am one. It would simply go to the highest  bidder. I, 40 years ago, came out in favor of auctioning radio and  television channels rather than simply lending yourself into a  situation in which favoritism has to play a part. If you and I both  contend for the right to build in a particular corner, the market  solution is whoever pays for it most ought to prevail. But by  the same token, we have to recognize that there are political entities  with which we have to deal. I know an otherwise utterly honorable  person who bribed a labor union here. Otherwise he simply would nor  have been able to get his building up in time to&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. GREEN:&nbsp; But your answer is off the  point. The radio and television spectrum is scarce. You can&rsquo;t have too  many. So I agree with you that we should put them up for auction&mdash;&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp; So are locational advantages in New York City.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; So is&mdash;&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. GREEN:&nbsp; No, the Saturn plant can locate in 20 states, and the issue  is, what state gives them the most tax revenues to bribe them to come  in. It&rsquo;s not a productive competition. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t  produce any wealth. It just shakes down cities like ours for our tax  dollars. Are you worried about that at all, Mr. Starr, because, again,  you didn&rsquo;t mention it?<br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the enterprise zone idea, sure.<br>
          <br>
          MR. STARR:&nbsp; I would much rather have  businesses compete on the basis of what location is not only cheapest  originally, but nearest to the raw materials and nearest to the market&mdash;<br>
          <br>
          MR. GREEN:&nbsp; Exactly.<br>
          <br>
          MR. STARR:&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;and nearest to the  transportation. But I would question your statement that developers  have been given unnecessary benefits. Let me point out that when Donald  Trump was given the benefits that he used in order to turn the defunct  Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt, no one else moved forward. No one  else wanted it. No one else would touch it. <strong>The development of this,  which with temporary tax concessions, which Henry George would have  made automatic, made the resuscitation of that area possible.</strong><br>
          <br>
          MR. BUCKLEY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. Roger Starr, author of The Rise  and Fall of New York City; thank you, Mr. Mark Green; and thank you,  gentlemen of Regis.<br>
