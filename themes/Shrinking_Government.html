  <p>What purposes should government serve? It seems to me that, among other things,
      it should do those things which it is more efficient to do on a shared basis.  </p>
  <p>If a society has victims, it should minister to their needs, but, better,
      it should be reformed to the point where society doesn't have victims. One
      of
        its key roles is to establish justice, and prevent the victimization of some
        by others, both at the individual level and at the systematic, structural
      level.</p>
  <p>When we've established justice, we may not need some of the functions we ask
      our government to supply.</p>

  Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What Affordable
Housing Problem?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like all creatures --
goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Why do those statistics not seem to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The
answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
In contrast to those 11- to 14-percent annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three
decades.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A close friend in
Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed
here will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
subsidies. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In Conclusion, I have tried to show that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values. </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
