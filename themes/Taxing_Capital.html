<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p>        Why would we want to tax capital? What do we have to gain by doing
      that, before we've taxed land value fully? If we tax it, we send it offshore,
      along with all the jobs that go with it. </p>
    <p>If, <em>after we've taxed land value
        fully</em>, we still need additional revenue, then perhaps it could be
        argued at we
        should
        tax capital &#8212; but there is no good reason to tax capital before
        we tax land value! We can tax land value without losing even a square
        foot of land.</p>
    <p>When we tax capital, we get less of things we say we want more of. When
      we tax land, we get more of the things we say we want more of. (Seems like
      a no-brainer to me!)</p>

  <div align="left">Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/justice_the_object_taxation_the_means.html">Justice the Object --
      Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We certainly want more
      houses. There are a few people who have bigger houses than any one reasonable
      family can occupy; but the great mass of the American people are underhoused.
      There, in the city of New York, the plight to which all American cities
      are tending, you will find that 65 % of the population are living two families
      or more to the single floor. Yet let a man put a house in any part of the
      United States, and down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a fine for having
      put up a house. </small></div>
  <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that industry is
      a good thing, and that thrift is a good thing; and there are some people
      who say that if a man be industrious, and if a man he thrifty, he can easily
      accumulate wealth. Whether that be true or not, industry is certainly a
      good thing, and thrift is certainly a good thing. But what do we do if
      a man be industrious? If he produces wealth enough, and by thrift accumulates
      wealth at all, down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a part of it. </small></p>
  <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that that is stupid;
      that we ought not by our taxes to repress the production of wealth; that
      when a farmer reclaims a strip of the desert and turns it into an orchard
      and a vineyard, or on the prairie produces crops and feeds fine cattle,
      that, so far from being taxed and fined for having done these things, we
      ought to be glad that he has done it; that we ought to welcome all energy;
      that no man can Produce wealth for himself without augmenting the general
      stock, without making the whole country richer. We impose some taxes for
      the purpose of getting rid of things, for the purpose of having fewer of
      the things that we tax. In most of our counties and States when dogs become
      too numerous, there is imposed a dog tax to get rid of dogs. Well, we impose
      a dog tax to get rid of dogs, and why should we impose a house tax unless
      we want to get rid of houses? Why should we impose a farm tax unless we
      want fewer farms? Why should we tax any man for having exerted industry
      or energy in the production of wealth? </small></p>
  <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Tax houses and there
        will certainly be fewer houses.</strong> If you go east to the city of
        Brooklyn, you may see that demonstrated to the eye. What first surprised
        me in the city of churches was to see long rows of buildings, of brown-stone
        houses, two stories in front and three stories behind; or three stories
        in front and four stories behind; and I thought for a moment what foolish
        idea ever entered the brains of those men, to have left out half an upper
        story in that way? I found out by inquiring that it was all on account
        of tax. In the city of Brooklyn, the assessor is only supposed to look
        in front, and so by making the house in that way, you can get a three-story
        building behind with only a two-story front and a two-story tax. </small></p>
  <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So in England, in the old
      houses, there you may see the result of the window tax. The window tax
      is in force in France today, and in France there are two hundred thousand
      houses, according to the census, that have no window at all &#8212; in
      order to escape the tax. </small></p>
  <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So if you tax ships there
      will be fewer ships. What old San Franciscan cannot remember the day when
      in this harbour might be seen the graceful forms and lofty spars of so
      many American ships, the fleetest and best in the world? I well remember
      the day that no American who crossed to Europe thought of crossing on any
      other than an American ship. Today, if you wish to cross the Atlantic,
      you must cross on a British steamer, unless you choose to cross on a German
      or French steamer. On the high seas of the world the American ship is becoming
      almost as rare as a Chinese junk. Why? Simply because we have taxed our
      ships out of existence. There is the proof. </small></p>
  <div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <p><small> Tax buildings, and you will have fewer or poorer buildings; tax
        farms, and you will have fewer farms and more wilderness; tax ships,
        there will be fewer and poorer ships; and tax capital, and there will
        be less capital; but you may tax land values all you please and there
        will not he a square inch the less land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tax land values all you please up to the point of
        taking the full annual value &#8212; up to the point of making mere ownership
        in land utterly unprofitable, so that no one will want merely to own
        land &#8212; what will be the result? Simply that land will be the easier
        had by the user. </span>Simply that the land will become valueless to
        the mere speculator &#8212; to the dog in the manger, who wants merely
        to hold and not to use; to the forestaller, who wants merely to reap
        where others have sown, to gather to himself the products of labour,
        without doing labour. Tax land values, and you leave to production its
    full rewards, and you open to producers natural opportunities.&nbsp; <a

home in on it. <br>
B. Taxable surplus is also what you can tax without
driving land into the

C. To tax rent we must be sure there is rent to tax, and
we must adopt public
policies to husband and maximize it, and avoid policies
that lower and dissipate it.

</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. Taxing the Net Product of
Land Permits Untaxing Capital</b> </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The IMF, World Bank,
and various U.S. advisors tell you and the world that you must make a
hard choice: you must cut spending on social welfare, even on needed
pensions and back wages, in order to attract and retain capital. The
supposed hard choice is false, and the advice is bad. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">When
you tax Net Land Revenue, as advised here, you are not taxing at all
the investor who uses his capital to improve land, or equip it with
machinery and stock it with goods. </span>The landowner or manager
gets to deduct the User Cost of Capital from the tax base (as shown in
Section 2). The improver gets to keep, free of tax, the entire <b><i>increment</i></b>
in production that his capital generates. Taxes are limited to the Net
Product of land, which you may even evaluate and tax prior to the
owner's using the land at all. In the acronyms of finance, the investor
who applies real capital to Russian land will get to keep the entire
"Marginal Return" (MR) from the capital. This MR after-tax (MRAT) will
become the same as the MR before-tax (MRBT). Few other nations can
offer such an attraction. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>This change will reverse the capital flight you now suffer from,
and help recall over $100 billions of expatriate capital now stashed
abroad. More, it will attract foreign capital, whose supply is highly
elastic, into private ventures. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Russia
will become like a "tax haven" for mobile capital (and all capital is
mobile within a few years).</span> This will not be done clandestinely
in the sometimes sinister manner we associate with Cyprus, Switzerland,
or Bermuda, but quite openly and honestly. Russia will not, like the
present tax havens of the world, serve merely as a broker or transit
station for capital headed elsewhere; Russia will be the final
destination, to your great advantage. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>Foreign capital will not come here primarily to buy Russian land
and collect Russian rents, for you will be taxing that land heavily. It
will come primarily to improve, stock and equip Russian land with new
capital that you will NOT be taxing. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>Will the IMF object and make trouble for you? They should be
happy to see their loans used to create capital in Russia, and
restructure your industries to earn income to repay the loans. That is
what they <b><i>say</i></b> they want, at any rate, and this will be a
good way to test their sincerity. If they do make trouble, you need not
care, for you will no longer need them: world capital will be beating a
path to your door. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>The OECD will surely object, for they are waging a campaign to
force all nations to adopt the same kind of oppressive, biased,
counterproductive tax systems they use themselves. So far, however,
they cannot even compel several small island nations to bend to them,
so I think giant Russia, with its proud sovereign traditions, can
resist. If you do exempt capital from taxation, as recommended here,
and begin to suck in significant amounts of capital from the whole
world's pool, your competition will alarm and embarrass many OECD and
other nations, who may be forced to follow suit. That, however, is a
problem, if it is one, for a somewhat speculative future. Your
immediate problem and crisis calls for recalling $100 billions of your
own expatriate capital, and few could object to, or feel threatened by
that. </small><small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html"><span
