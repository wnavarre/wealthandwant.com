</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this Irish famine which
provoked the land agitation, there is
nothing that is peculiar. Such famines on a smaller or a larger scale
are constantly occurring. Nay, more! the fact is, that famine, just
such famine as this Irish famine, constantly exists in the richest and
most highly civilized lands. It persists even in "good times" 'when
trade is "booming;" it spreads and rages whenever from any cause
industrial depression comes. It is kept under, or at least kept from
showing its worst phases, by poor-rates and almshouses, by private
benevolence and by vast organized charities, but it still exists,
gnawing in secret when it does not openly rage. In the very centers of
civilization, where the machinery of production and exchange is at the
highest point of efficiency, where bankvaults hold millions, and
show-windows flash with more than a prince's ransom, where elevators
and warehouses are gorged with grain, and markets are piled with all
things succulent and toothsome, where the dinners of Lucullus are eaten
every day, and, if it be but cool, the very greyhounds wear dainty
blankets&#8211;in these centers in wealth and power and refinement, there are
always hungry men and women and little children. Never the sun goes
down but on human beings prowling like wolves far food, or huddling
together like vermin for shelter and warmth. "Always with You" is the
significant heading under which a New York paper, in these most
prosperous times, publishes daily the tales of chronic famine; and in
the greatest and richest city in the world&#8211;in that very London where
the plenty of meat in the butchers' shops seemed to some savages the
most wondrous of all its wonderful sights&#8211;in that very London, the
mortuary reports have a standing column for deaths by starvation. ... <span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Crowded! Is it any wonder that
people are crowded together as they are in this city, when we see other
people taking up far more land than they can by any possibility use,
and holding it for enormous prices? Why, what would have happened if,
when these doors were opened, the first people who came in had claimed
all the seats around them, and demanded a price of others who
afterwards came in by the same equal right? Yet that is precisely the
way we are treating this continent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is the reason why people are huddled together in tenement
houses; that is the reason why work is difficult to get; the reason
that there seems, even in good times, a surplus of labor, and that in
those times that we call bad, the times of industrial depression, there
are all over the country thousands and hundreds of thousands of men
tramping from place to place, unable to find employment. ...&nbsp;<a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The very robbery that the
masses of
men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
For the value that with the increase of population and social advance
attaches to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured
ownership of the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation
in land wherever there is any prospect of advancing population or of
coming improvement, thus producing <span style="font-weight: bold;">an
artificial scarcity of the
natural element of life and labor, and a strangulation of production
that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial depression as
disastrous to the world as destructive wars. ...&nbsp;</span><a

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, George differentiated
sharply between land itself and
the products -- or wealth, as he termed them -- which labor made from
the land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural
forces, but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter,
and, to produce wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter
and to these forces -- that is to say, to land. The land is the
source of all wealth. It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore
that labor fashions. It is the substance to which labor gives the
form."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> George saw, as between land and
products, certain elementary
differences. "In every essential, land differs from those things
which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the
creation of God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity;
they may be increased illimitably. It exists, though generations come
and go; they in a little while decay and pass again into the
elements." </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having noted these differences,
George proceeded to use them as
the basis for his examination of related areas of economics, such as
speculation. When asked how speculation worked, George responded that
a distinction must be made between speculation in land and
speculation in products. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Writing of industrial depressions,
he said, "When, with the desire
to consume more, there coexist the ability and willingness to produce
more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot be charged either to
overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly, the trouble is that
production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy each other . </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"How does this inability arise? It
is evidently and by common
consent the result of speculation. But of speculation in what? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Certainly not of speculation in
things which are the products of
labor ...for the effect of speculation in such things, as is well
shown in current treatises that spare me the necessity of
illustration, is simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady
the interplay of production and consumption by an action analogous to
that of a fly-wheel in a machine."&nbsp; In other
words, the tendency of speculation in products is to increase the
demand for products and therefore to increase the price of products.
This increased price will induce more production, which, increasing
the supply, will tend to lower the price. Throughout this cycle,
there has been a stimulating effect on production in general. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He continued, "Therefore, if
speculation be the cause of these
industrial depressions, it must be speculation in things not the
production of labor, but yet necessary to the exertion of labor in
the production of wealth -- of things of fixed quantity; that is to
say, it must be speculation in land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How can this be? How can
speculation in land cause industrial
depression? George explains, "...that there is a connection between
the rapid construction of railroads and industrial depression, anyone
who understands what increased land values mean, and who has noticed
the effect which the construction of railroads has upon land
speculation, can easily see. Wherever a railroad was built or
projected, lands sprang up in value under the influence of
speculation, and thousands of millions of dollars were added to the
nominal values which capital and labor were asked to pay outright, or
to pay in installments, as the price of being allowed to go to work
and produce wealth. The inevitable result was to check production.
.."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tendency of speculation in
land is similar to that of
speculation in products; it increases the demand for land and thereby
increases the price of land. However, here the similarity ends. The
supply of land is fixed; as successive units of land become priced
beyond the level at which labor and capital can profitably engage in
production, an increasing (though artificial) scarcity of land
develops. "The inevitable result was to check production."&nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, according to George, another
difference between land and
products is that speculation in products tends to stimulate
production, whereas speculation in land tends to check production.&nbsp;
