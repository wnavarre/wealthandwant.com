  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p align="center"><em>land appreciates &#8212; capital rusts!</em></p>
      <p align="left">Few media stories about the real estate
          market or the "housing bubble" &#8212; and probably few economists&#8212;        recognize the reality that while land appreciates, buildings
          depreciate.&nbsp; Commercial investors claim depreciation on their
          income tax filings &#8212; in fact, the same building may be depreciated
          over and over again by a series of owners, each time probably from a
          higher starting point!&nbsp; But few will acknowledge that what has
          actually occurred is a decline in the value of the building.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roof, windows and other systems deteriorate
          even when well maintained.&nbsp; Equally important, features once
          considered state-of-the-art become obsolete as technology moves
          forward.&nbsp; Finally, a building that was highly suitable for a
          Central Business District site at midcentury is likely to be an
          underuse of the same site at the turn of the century, if the local
          area is healthy.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          And in the same period of time, the Central Business District is likely
          to have expanded, changing the definition of "highest and best use" of
          sites in the newer zone from residential to commercial, or
          single-family residential to multi-family. Even a well-maintained and
          updated mansion in the business district may no longer be a good use
          of that site.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that when a new house is built, the cost of the land
          represents 20% to 25% of the selling price.&nbsp; In the first years,
          the house's depreciation may be slow, because systems are new and the
          owners may be adding amenities that the builder didn't provide (a deck,
          closet and other fittings, landscaping, etc).&nbsp; But within a few
          years, all the improvements other than perhaps well-maintained
          landscaping start to depreciate a bit.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if the location
          is good, the site will appreciate.&nbsp; If it is close to established
          amenities of the central business district, that will tend to be fairly
          steady.&nbsp; If it is in a fringe area, with new schools, new
          firehouse, slowly developing shopping and services, as those services
          start to be developed, the site value will begin to rise.&nbsp;
          Depending on the site's proximity to secure and high-paying jobs,
          appreciation may be rapid.&nbsp; Within a few years, land's share of
          the total property value will pass 50% and then 75%.&nbsp; When it
          gets as high as 85%, there may begin to be a trend toward teardowns.
          (Think
          of the northern suburbs of Chicago.) In some areas, sites get recycled
          rather frequently.&nbsp; (Think
          of Hollywood.)</p>
      <p align="left">A May, 2006, Federal Reserve Board study confirmed that
        single family houses depreciate at 1.5% per year. Can commercial buildings
        be much different? Certainly machinery will tend to depreciate, no matter
        how well it is maintained. That same study said that, in the top 46 metro
        markets, land averaged about
        51% of the total value of single family housing in 2004, with a range
        from about 20% in Oklahoma City to over 88% in San Francisco. (Interestingly,
        the average value of the housing stock varied far less than the land
        values per house!)</p>

    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter
        with altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that
        hold when men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations
        and complex industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores
        of millions, in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so
        far that large numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users,
        it still remains true that we are all land animals and can live only
        on land, and that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one
        can be deprived without being murdered, and for which no one can be compelled
        to pay another without being robbed. But even in a state of society where
        the elaboration of industry and the increase of permanent improvements
        have made the need for private possession of land wide-spread, there
        is no difficulty in conforming individual possession with the equal right
        to land. For as soon as any piece of land will yield to the possessor
        a larger return than is had by similar labor on other land a value attaches
        to it which is shown when it is sold or rented. Thus, <strong>the value of the
        land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements in or on it,
        always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all are entitled
        in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer or successor
        of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</strong></p>
      <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of
        common ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses
        what value attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on
        it. The principle is the same as in the case referred to, where a human
        father leaves equally to his children things not susceptible of specific
        division or common use. In that case such things would be sold or rented
        and the value equally applied.</p>
      <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
        men, would have the community act.</p>
      <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
        letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the
        task, impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in
        equal shares; still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so
        divided.</p>
      <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
        with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
        to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value
        of the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements
        on it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues,
        we would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes
        now levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes,
        since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements
        of the right of property.</p>
      <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as
        a conforming of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
      <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that
        clash.</p>
      <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
        is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each
        one has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
      <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has
        intended all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
      <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there
        must be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry
        may be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
      <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those
        socialists referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation
        of men in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right
        of private property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical
        seem to argue, that to secure the right of private property we must ignore
        the equality of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say
        the one thing or the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s
        laws.</p>
      <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
        of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
        both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
        and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
      <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right
        to the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products
        of labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For
        we are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he
        has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
        is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
        life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
        you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed
        order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw
        and provided that with the increase of population and the development
        of industry the organization of human society into states or governments
        would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
      <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
        This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
        industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
        growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
        state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
      <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
        civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
        become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
        foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
        for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
        social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a right
        way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is the way
        intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising public revenues
        must accord with the moral law.</p>
      <p>Hence:</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs
                    to the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over
                    the scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase
                    the price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt
                    government; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine
                    industry and thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and
                    enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
                    <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
                    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
                    <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
                    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of
                    life, that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But
                    out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and
                    out of its effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell
                    and others must buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which
                    denies this gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy
                    and proclaims laws of national well-being utterly at variance with his
                    teaching. This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal
                    war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies
                    in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do
                    not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
                    of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more
                    clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not
                    the way God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
                    <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues
                    by a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
                    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
                    <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to
                    tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
                    any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
                    values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
                    exempt. <strong>The value of land irrespective of improvement
                    is the value that attaches to land by reason of increasing
                    population and social progress.</strong>                    This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and never does
                    and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different person from
                    the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money;
                    while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that
                    he receives it, and by selling or renting the land he can, as owner,
                    continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
                    <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
                    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
                    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
                    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to
                    the community as a whole.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all
                        economists are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement
                        or use &#8212; or what in the terminology of political economy is
                        styled rent, a term distinguished from the ordinary use of the word
                        rent by being applied solely to payments for the use of land itself &#8212; must
                        be paid by the owner and cannot be shifted by him on the user. To
                        explain in another way the reason given in the text: Price is not
                        determined by the will of the seller or the will of the buyer, but
                        by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to things
                        constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
                        by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the
                        cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
                        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce
                        such cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat
                        or tobacco or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay,
                        and thus the cheapening in the cost of producing steel which improved
                        processes have made in recent years has greatly reduced the price
                        of steel. But land has no cost of production, since it is created
                      by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>

                        never be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in
                        no wise increase the demand for land or enable landowners to check
                        supply by withholding land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization,
                        a case I mention because rent may in this way be demanded for the
                        use of land even before economic or natural rent arises, the taking
                        by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort from labor
                        could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not
                        left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent
                        proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they receive, would
                        in no way increase the superiority of their land and the demand for
                        it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent, to compel
                        the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they were
                        getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult for
                        them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not

                    <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
                    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
                    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
                    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on
                    thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
                    of wealth, by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please,
                    without any artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public
                    purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that
                    of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply
                    collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense
                    with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish
                    man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
                    <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
                    it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and
                    degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother
                    for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
                    <p>See how close is the analogy. <strong>In that primitive
                        condition ere the need for the state arises there are
                        no land values.</strong> The products of labor
                    have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches
                    to land itself. <strong>But as increasing density of population
                    and increasing elaboration of industry necessitate the organization
                    of the state, with
                    its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land. As
                    population still increases and industry grows more elaborate,
                    so the needs for public
                    revenues increase. And at the same time and from the same
                    causes land values increase. <em>The connection is invariable.</em></strong> The value of things produced
                    by labor tends to <em><strong>decline</strong></em> with social development, since the larger scale
                    of production and the improvement of processes tend steadily to reduce
                    their cost. <strong>But the value of land on which population
                    centers goes up and up. </strong>Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne. Consider
                    the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
                    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
                    due? <em><strong>Is it not due to the density and activity
                    of the populations of those cities &#8212; to the very causes
                    that require great public expenditure for streets, drains,
                    public buildings, and all the many things needed
                    for the health, convenience and safety of such great cities?</strong></em> See how
                    with the growth of such cities the one thing that steadily increases
                    in value is land; how the opening of roads, the building of railways,
                    the making of any public improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it
                    not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to say a tendency
                    willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He who ordained
                    the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land provided
                    the means to meet those needs?</p>
                    <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper
                    still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose
                    of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land
                    values increase with the growth of society not only such a perfectly
                    adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual
                    perceptions by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with
                    regard to the individual that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening
                    to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
                    <p>Consider: <strong>Here is a natural law by which as society
                        advances the one thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a
                        natural law by virtue of which all growth of population,
                        all advance of the arts, all general
                    improvements of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the
                        commands of justice and the dictates of expediency prompt
                        us to take for the common
                    uses of society.</strong> Now, since increase in the fund
                    available for the common uses of society is increase in the
                    gain that goes equally to each member
                    of society, is it not clear that the law by which land values
                    increase with social advance while the value of the products
                    of labor does not
                    increase, tends with the advance of civilization to make
                    the share that goes equally to each member of society more
                    and more important as compared
                    with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and thus
                    to make the advance of civilization lessen relatively the
                    differences that in
                    a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the
                    weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
                    the purpose of the Creator
                    to be that the advance of man in civilization should be an
                    advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and
                    greater equality, instead
                    of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
                    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

A. No. <strong>Houses are never worth any more than it costs to reproduce them.
Good government tends to diminish the cost of house building; how, then, can
good
government increase the value of houses?</strong> You are confused by the fact
that houses, being attached to land, seem to increase in value, when it is the
land and not the house that really increases. It is the same mistake that a somewhat
noted economic teacher, who advocates protection as his specialty, made when
he tried
to show that there is an &quot;unearned increment&quot; to houses as well as
to lands. He did so by instancing a lot of vacant land which had risen in value
from $5000 to $10,000, and comparing it with a house on a neighboring lot which,
as he said, had also increased in value from $5000 to $10,000. At the moment
when he wrote, the house to which he referred could have been reproduced for
$5000; and had he been capable of thinking out a proposition he must have discovered
that it was the lot on which the house stood, and not the house itself, which
had increased in value. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

      <br>
      <small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
        stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting

        it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
      understate land values for methodological reasons. Starting with
        estimates for overall real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
        subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
        capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
        replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
        construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
        steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
    is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.</small>    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">37 Balance Sheets for the

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small>However, the value of any building tends
        eventually to decline,
        until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
        which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
        with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
      Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
        because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
        uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
        costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
        on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
        particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
        land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
        This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
        tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
        improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
        not its current net income but its opportunity cost -- the minimum
        yield
        required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
        instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
        rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
      land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.</small>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
        of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
        premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
        because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
      taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
        depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
        of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
        constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
      <br>
      This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the rising
        trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
        the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
        procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
        favor obsolete real property. ... <br>
      <br>
      Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap large
        profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
        because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
        depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
        of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
        payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
        out of the market.<strong> ... </strong><br>
      <br>
      The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be desired.
        Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
        arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
        market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
        indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
        tax bill will be.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
        administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
        enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
        9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
        5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
        19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
        governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
      aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span><br>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and
              upon the comfort of its population which would result from the change of
              fiscal policy which this article proposes. At present, a tempting premium
              is placed upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while
              a heavy penalty is imposed upon improvement. Most land appreciates constantly.
              All buildings depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building
              is taxed equally with the land.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to put
              up a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin
              which now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more, and
              while paying a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is
              thereby enabled to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground,
              which the community is continually rendering more valuable. The new building
              would absorb a large amount of capital, would begin to run down even before
              it could be occupied, and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not
              the landlord justified in letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing
              economic rent, and waiting till he can get a fancy price for the right
              to collect it?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
              making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it
              from the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its possibilities.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better

              for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
              an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a public
              revenue adequate to all real public needs.</p>

      <p>        Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment
          on Parts of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who
          Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
          the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a
          remarkable oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at
          the rate of 0.5 to 1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9
          And in view of the fact that assessments in New York localities have
          historically been very infrequent, one can understand how the land
          values are in reality a far higher proportion of parcel value than
          assessments would suggest.10 This means that in a period of seven years,
          for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price by 50
          percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to be illustrative.
          Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their rates of change
          during this time span; upstate New York was largely stable, but downstate
          localities experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
        <p> Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
          view&#8221; of property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the
          burden of the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital
          in the form of a lower net return instead of being shifted to users
          of property in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11 Proponents
          point out that &#8220;the tax on improvements is essentially a nationwide
          tax on capital . . . [and therefore] its incidence will depend on the
          characteristics of supply and demand for capital nationally rather
          than on a single market.&#8221;12 The effect of this is to make the
          tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;13 Nonetheless, in a small footnote,
          Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old view&#8221; in
          stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that the new
          view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific
          state (underlining in original). Thus, the old or traditional view
          was adhered to in the analysis. . ; that is, the excise effect of the
          tax was considered dominant.&#8221;14 The ubiquity of New York's property
          tax, and that it has over 1,300 local assessment and tax districts,
          may well have escaped their notice. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read
