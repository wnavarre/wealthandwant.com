and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span

the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values

allow them to poison the air or to pollute the rivers." (1995 March)<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That&#8217;s how great fortunes are
made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). Land titles, corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;
means &#8220;private law&#8221;) funnel multi-trillions of dollars each year from
the many to the few. </small><br>

<p><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Conspiracy.html">Is There a Conspiracy in the Teaching
    of Economics and History
within the American Education System?</a> an interview with Mason Gaffney</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> MG: Generically, it goes back thousands
    of years: <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">every
    system that divides mankind into rentiers and proles
    requires a rationale.</span> Those with leisure have time and resources to
    provide it: sometimes directly, but usually through hired guns.</p>
  <p>The need became more acute in the USA during and after the Progressive Era,
    with its development of the secret ballot and direct democracy. Voters could
    no longer be bought or intimidated directly; they had to be brainwashed.
    The device used was to replace the older Classical Political Economy (Quesnay,
    Adam Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and Henry George) with "Neo-classical Economics," which
    blurred all distinctions between producers and rentiers.</p>
  <p>Henry George was the clear and present danger that triggered off the work
      of early neo-classicals, especially in America, but also around the world.
      He was not just an economic writer but a political force. He was nearly
    elected mayor of New York, a key position in US national politics. He communicated
      well with masses of people: a few who understood his reasoning, and a mass
      who got the general idea and resonated with his personality. He had an
    ethnic
      constituency, the Irish-Americans of New York, who carried his ideas into
    the Irish-English conflict, a springboard for a worldwide anti-colonial movement.
      He and they carried his ideas into Vatican politics, triggering off the
    1891
      Encyclical, "<i>Rerum Novarum</i>," a defining turning point in the social
      action views of the Catholic Church. His followers grew strong in the Radical
      wing of the Liberal Party in England, had a deep influence on Edwardian
      politics, culminating in the disempowerment of the House of Lords in 1911.</p>
  <p><b>TPR </b>- So, it goes back farther than Henry George's detractors. Who
    would you say was the first "professional" economist? </p>
  <p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Thomas Malthus was perhaps the first person to teach a
    subject of that name, although earlier writers, including church writers, said
    a lot about it. Thomas Aquinas had been highly influential; so had Aristotle.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - They were paid to keep quiet about
    the land question?</p>
  <p><b><i>MG</i></b> - No more than anyone else. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">They lived in a society dominated by landowners.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">  </span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adam Smith spent his life on
          the payroll of the Duke of Buccleuch, as tutor for His Grace's son.</span> Landowners
          were so very secure, some of them could let their house intellectuals tweak
          their noses with radical ideas - probably found it entertaining. It was
          later, after universal manhood suffrage, that the landowners got nasty
          and conspiratorial and defensive, and went about brainwashing the electorate. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Ricardo and Von Thuenen were independently wealthy, and could afford to
        indulge their passion for ideas, objectively. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Mill was a prodigy who built an enormous reputation, and had civil service
        tenure, before he ventured radical ideas about land ownership. <br>
    </li>
    <li>A.R. Wallace, too, had a towering rep. as a biologist before venturing
        into public policy. Had he not done so, he would still be as famous as Darwin,
        as originally he was.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">All this time there was a large majority
      of small intellects who
    catered to the landed interest. </span>Nassau Senior was one. The weight
    of their numbers was enough to offset their mediocre attainments, and cast
    Mill as an
    eccentric loner, an impractical ideal ist, as well as a sissy who favored
    women's rights.&nbsp;
