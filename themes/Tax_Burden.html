Burden</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Not all forms of taxes impose a burden. But few Americans realize this;
    as my mother would have expressed it, <em>our education has been neglected!</em></p>
  <p>Income taxes are a burden. Sales taxes are a burden. Building taxes are
    a burden. So what's left? What is there that is fundamentally different from
    wages, sales and buildings? Land value! </p>
  <p>Reassessment is a way of making sure
      that the burden of property taxes is distributed in proportion to the current
      values of all the properties within a tax district, so that the owners
    of faster-appreciating properties bear their fair share of the tax burden,
    and those whose properties
      are not so favored (perhaps because they lack attractive views, or access
    to infrastructure, jobs or services, or are near noxious neighbors) are not
    paying
      more than their current share. Georgists will argue that the tax burden
    should not fall on the manmade additions to one's property, that apportioning
    the
      tax burden in proportion to the value of the land itself is more just and
  provides a more desirable set of incentives. </p>
  <p align="right"><em>&quot;In my opinion the least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved
    value of land, the Henry George argument of many, many years ago.&quot;</em><br>

  <p align="right"><em>&quot;Pure gro</em><em>und rent is in the nature of a <a href="Surplus.html">'surplus</a>,' which can be
      taxed heavily without distorting production incentives or reducing efficiency.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.</p>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
    not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
    Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is
    the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this.</p>
  <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt.</p>
  <p>Now discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to equally
    tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the true rule, that
    taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion of the general prosperity,
    the securing of substantial equality, and the recognition of inalienable
    rights, let us consider upon what species of property it may be best laid.
    <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. We may
    tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. We might take the whole value
    of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p>And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production. </p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
achieve that end, we must stifle sales and payroll and income
taxes. They are the chief alternatives to property taxes. They are
inherently counterproductive because they are contingent on some
"taxable event" which is a constructive act of production or
exchange. </span>Henry George, in one of his striking similes,
observes that
a packhorse can carry a heavy load on its back, but hardly any load
if you bind it to the shins. Economic theorists write of the<span

of "taxable events:" both are saying the same thing in their own
argot. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Sales
and payroll and income taxes are like the load strapped
to the packhorse's shins, dragging on every step. Indeed, they are
more like a load bonded under each hoof: the horse has no burden if
it just stands still.
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What, then, makes these regressive
taxes so attractive to
landowners? Why this constant clamor and pressure to raise them to
provide "property tax relief?" In the short run they do relieve
landowners. They appear to shift taxes off landowners, who are well
organized and vocal, and onto working people who are not. But they
soon shift back onto landowners by repelling mobile capital and
labor. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span
