Robert G. Ingersoll: <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay
Sermon</a> (1886)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
any land that he does not use.
Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
it. And why? Don't you know that if people could bottle the air, they
would? Don't you know that there would be an American Air-bottling
Association? And don't you know that they would allow thousands and
millions to die for want of breath, if they could not pay for air? I am
not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a
few landlords and millions of tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tenement house is the enemy of modesty, the enemy of virtue,
the
enemy of patriotism. Home is where the virtues grow. I would like to
see the law so that every home, to a small amount, should be free not
only from sale for debts, but should be absolutely free from taxation,
so that every man could have a home. Then we will have a nation of
patriots.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, suppose that every man were to have all the land he is able
to
buy. The Vanderbilts could buy today all the land that is in farms in
the State of Ohio -- every foot of it. Would it be for the best
interest of that State to have a few landlords and four or five
millions of serfs? ...<a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html"> <span

  </a>Robert Smilie, quoted by James Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
  Policy</a>&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land and Social Problems</p>
  <p>&quot;Late in life I have realised, what I failed to see in the early days,
      that the root of all our social problems lies in the land question. So long
      as land is withheld from free access to men, anxious and willing to utilise
      Nature's bounty, just so long will you have a crowd of men at the factory gate
      waiting for jobs. The key to the anomalies we are all endeavouring to solve
      is the land problem. &#8230;If the atmosphere could have been parcelled out
      and bottled up so that every child that comes into the world would only be
      allowed to breathe on the payment of air-rent, you can picture a state of affairs
      as deplorable, but no less unjust and ridiculous, as that obtaining at the
      present time with your private ownership and monopoly of the land.&quot; [Mr.
      Robert Smillie, at Newcastle-under-Lyme, October 1921]</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Times have caught up with
Ingersoll. Ronald Coase, prominent
Chicago economist, says polluters (whom he calls emitters, to avoid
bias) have as much right to emit as victims (he says receptors) have
to breathe clean air. It doesn&#8217;t matter, says Coase, how we
assign property rights originally: as long as property is firm, the
market will sort it all out. However, since emitters have invested in
costly facilities, and property is sacred... you see whither this
unbiased science is tending.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Was he laughed to scorn? <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Au contraire</span>, he was raised on the
shoulders of his adulatory peers and anointed a demi-god (which tells
you something about his peers). Having risen on wings of theory the
idea found its way into practice, and today The South Coast Air
Quality Management District awards "offset rights" to those with
worthy track records of emitting. New emitters must buy "property
rights" from old ones. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And those who want to breathe?
Coase says they should pay for the
privilege, as they pay for indulging any personal taste. After all,
they already pay those who supply them with land to live on. Only
welfare bums would expect property owners to dip into their
hard-earned savings and supply them with free air, when the market
has a solution at hand. All they need do is buy offset rights from
Ancient and Honorable Emitters. When they want to breathe, they just
retire the rights upwind of them. This is a marvel of efficiency,
too. They retire only what it takes to clean the air they need: no
waste.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If they can&#8217;t afford to buy
outright, they could rent --
markets have ingenious solutions for all problems, like any good
panacea. Gas masks are another free-market solution: much better than
socialistic policies that would impose uniform clean air on everyone,
whether they want it or not.&nbsp; </small><small>...<a

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I began pondering this dilemma about ten years ago after retiring from Working
    Assets, a business I cofounded in 1982. (Working Assets offers telephone
    and credit card services which automatically donate to nonprofit groups working
    for a better world.) My initial ruminations focused on climate change caused
    by human emissions of heat-trapping gases. Some analysts saw this as a &#8220;tragedy
    of the commons,&#8221; a concept popularized forty years ago by biologist
    Garrett Hardin. According to Hardin, people will always overuse a commons
    because it&#8217;s in their self-interest to do so. I saw the problem instead
    as a pair of tragedies: first a tragedy of the market, which has no way of
    curbing its own excesses, and second a tragedy of government, which fails
    to protect the atmosphere because polluting corporations are powerful and
    future generations don&#8217;t vote.</p>
  <p>This way of viewing the situation led to a hypothesis: if the commons is
    a victim of market and government failures, rather than the cause of its
    own destruction, the remedy might lie in strengthening the commons. But how
    might that be done? According to prevailing wisdom, commons are inherently
    difficult to manage because no one effectively owns them. If Waste Management
    Inc. owned the atmosphere, it would charge dumpers a fee, just as it does
    for terrestrial landfills. But since no one has title to the atmosphere,
    dumping proceeds without limit or cost. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
