  Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix: FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value, how
    would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public needs?</em></p>
  <p>A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
      values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth,
      are not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values
      of the state at large.</p>
  <p><em>Q4. What disposition would you make of the revenues that exceeded the needs
    of government?</em></p>
  <p>A. The people who ask this question ought to settle it with those who want
      to know whether the single tax would yield revenue enough. I do not believe
      that public revenues under the single tax would exceed the just needs of
      economical government; in better highways, better sidewalks, better wharves,
      better schools, better public service of various kinds, we should find sufficient
      demand for all our revenues. But the question of deficiency or surplus is
      one to be met and disposed of when it arises. The present question is the
      wisdom and the justice of applying land values to common use, as far as they
      will go or as much of them as may be needed as the case may prove to be.</p>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em></p>
  <p>A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
      government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
      each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
      there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would be still
      further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
      pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
      be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
      second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
      out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
      values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. And
      this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
      in taxation.</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
        of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
        it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
        sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
        and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right
    to do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
        thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the
    fairest division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
        of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
        octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
        duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
        on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
        the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
        be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
        need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
        deem a right one?</p>
      <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
        the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
        scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
        price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
        they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
        thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
        others.</p>
      <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
      <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
        are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
        that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
        the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
        effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
        buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
        gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
        of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
        sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
        it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
        of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
        instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
        of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
      <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
        show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
        intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
      <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
        a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
        the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
        of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
        in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
        of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
        reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
        always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
        user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
        pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
        the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
        or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
        to be a user.</p>
      <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
        of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
        what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
        to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
        community as a whole.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
            are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
            what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
            from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
            for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
            be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
            in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
            will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
            as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
            determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
            the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
            increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
            cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
            or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
            in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
            recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
            cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
          Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
              by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
              and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
              can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
          2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
          particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
          by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
          for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
          3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
          in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
          social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
          withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
            be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
            the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
            land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
            because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
            economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
            were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
            since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
            of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
            receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
            demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
            to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
            were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
            for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
          merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
        of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
        to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
        impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
        it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
        by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
        artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
        that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
        most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
        enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
        temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
        innocent.</p>
      <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
        needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
        of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
        nourishment of the babe.</p>
      <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
        the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
        but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
        But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
        necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
        begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
        more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
        time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
        The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
        since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
        steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
        centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
        Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
        of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
        due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
        cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
        streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
        health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
        of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
        the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
        improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
        law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
        anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
        values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
      <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
        and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
        If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
        with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
        the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
        us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
        that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
      <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
        that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
        all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
        of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
        dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
        Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
        is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
        not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
        while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
        advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
        of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
        his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
        relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
        the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
        the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
        should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
        equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
        an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may
expect
these
<small><small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It would dispense with a whole army of tax
gatherers and other officials which present taxes require, and place in
the treasury a much larger portion of what is taken from people, while
by making government simpler and cheaper, it would tend to make it
purer.</span></small><br>
<small>2. It would enormously increase the production of wealth--</small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(a) By the removal of the
burdens that now weigh upon industry
and thrift. ...</small><br>
<small>(b) On the contrary, the taxation of land values has the effect
of making land more easily available by industry, since it makes it
more difficult for owners of valuable land which they themselves do not
care to use to hold it idle for a large future price.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>(c) The taxation of the processes and products of labor on one
hand, and the insufficient taxation of land values on the other,
produce an unjust distribution of wealth which is building up in the
hands of a few, fortunes more monstrous than the world has ever before
seen, while the masses of our people are steadily becoming relatively
poorer.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<small>
<br>
</small><small> It would get rid of taxes which necessarily promote
fraud, perjury, bribery, and corruption, which lead men into
temptation, and which tax what the nation can least afford to
spare--honesty and conscience. Since land lies out-of-doors and cannot
be removed, and its value is the most readily ascertained of all
values, the tax to which we would resort can be collected with the
minimum of cost and the least strain on public morals. ...</small> </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This unjust distribution of wealth
develops on the one hand a class idle and wasteful because they are too
rich, and on the other hand a class idle and wasteful because they are
too poor. It deprives men of capital and opportunities which would make
them more efficient producers. It thus greatly diminishes production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(d) The unjust distribution which
is giving us the hundred-fold millionaire on the one side and the tramp
and pauper on the other, generates thieves, gamblers, and social
parasites of all kinds, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">requires
large expenditure of money and energy in watchmen, policemen, courts,
prisons, and other means of defense and repression. It kindles a greed
of gain and a worship of wealth, and produces a bitter struggle for
existence which fosters drunkenness, increases insanity, and causes men
whose energies ought to be devoted to honest production to spend their
time and strength in cheating and grabbing from each other. Besides the
moral loss, all this involves an enormous economic loss which the
Single Tax would save.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> (e) The taxes we would abolish
fall most heavily on the poorer agricultural districts, and tend to
drive population and wealth from them to the great cities.&nbsp; ...

Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AN EPIDEMIC of what passes for charity
    is sweeping over the land. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet there has been no disaster of fire or
    flood, no convulsion of nature, no destruction by public enemies. The seasons
    have kept their order, we have had the former and the latter rain, and the
    earth has not refused her increase. Granaries are filled to overflowing,
    and commodities, even these we have tried to make dear by tariff, were never
    before so cheap.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scarcity that is distressing and frightening
    the whole country is a scarcity of employment. It is the unemployed for whom
    charity is asked: not those who cannot or will not work, but those able to
    work and anxious to work, who, through no fault of their own, cannot find
    work. So clear, indeed, is it that of the great masses who are suffering
    in this country to-day, by far the greater part are honest, sober, and industrious,
    that the pharisees who preach that poverty is due to laziness and thriftlessness,
    and the fanatics who attribute it to drink, are for the moment silent. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet why is it that men able to work and
    willing to work cannot find work? It is not strange that the failure to work
    should bring want, for it is only by work that human wants are satisfied.
    But to say that widespread distress comes from widespread inability to find
    employment no more explains the distress than to say that the man died from
    want of breath explains a sudden death. The pressing question, the real question,
    is, What causes the want of employment? <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What more unnatural than that alms should
    be asked, not for the maimed, the halt and the blind, the helpless widow
    and the tender orphan, but for grown men, strong men, skilful men, men able
    to work and anxious to work! What more unnatural than that labor -- the producer
    of all food, all clothing, all shelter -- should not be exchangeable for
    its full equivalent in food, clothing, and shelter; that while the things
    it produces have value, labor, the giver of all value, should seem valueless!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here are men, having the natural wants of
    man, having the natural powers of man -- powers adapted and intended and
    more than sufficient to supply those wants. To say that they are willing
    to use their powers for the satisfaction of their wants, yet cannot do so,
    is to say that there is a wrong. If it is not their fault, whose fault is
    it? Wrong somewhere there must be.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why should charity be offered the unemployed?
    It is not alms they ask. They are insulted and embittered and degraded by
    being forced to accept as paupers what they would gladly earn as workers.
    What they ask is not charity, but the opportunity to use their own labor
    in satisfying their own wants. Why can they not have that? It is their natural
    right. He who made food and clothing and shelter necessary to man's life
    has also given to man, in the power of labor, the means of maintaining that
    life; and when, without fault of their own, men cannot exert that power,
    there is somewhere a wrong of the same kind as denial of the right of property
    and denial of the right of life -- a wrong equivalent to robbery and murder
    on the grandest scale.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charity can only palliate present suffering
    a little at the risk of fatal disease. For charity cannot right a wrong;
    only justice can do that.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Yet this is to be expected. For the question of the unemployed is but
  a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a question of
  the distribution of wealth.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>What do we mean when we say that it is scarcity of employment from which
  the masses are suffering? Not what we mean when we say of the idle rich that
  they suffer from want of employment. There is no scarcity of the need for work
  when so many are suffering for the want of things that work produces, when
  all of us would like more, and all but a very few of us could advantageously
  use more, of those things. Nor do we mean that there is scarcity of ability
  to work or willingness to work. Nor yet do we mean that there is scarcity of
  the natural materials and forces necessary for work. 'They are as abundant
  as they ever were or ever will be until the energy radiated by the sun upon
  our globe loses its intensity. What we really mean by "scarcity of employment " is
  such scarcity as would be brought about were an ice sheet continued into the
  summer to shut out the farmer from the fertile field he was anxious to cultivate;
  such a scarcity as was brought about in Lancashire when our blockade of the
  Southern ports raised suddenly and enormously the price of the staple that
  English operatives were anxious to turn into cloth. </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>What answers to the ice sheet or the blockade? Need we ask? May it not
  be seen, from our greatest cities to our newest territories, in the speculation
  which has everywhere been driving up the price of land -- that is to say, the
  toll that the active factor in all production must pay for permission to use
  the indispensable passive factor.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>If there are any who do not see the relation of these facts, it is because
  they have become accustomed to think of labor as deriving employment from capital,
  instead of, which is the true and natural relation, capital being the product
  and tool of labor. ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>So that, whether we begin at the right or the wrong end, any analysis
  brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the opportunities of
  finding employment and the rate of all wages depend ultimately upon the freedom
  of access to land; the price that labor must pay for its use.</span> </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"Scarcity of employment" is a comparatively new complaint in the United
  States. In our earlier times it was never heard of or thought of. There was "scarcity
  of employment " in Europe, but on this side of the Atlantic the trouble --
  so it was deemed by a certain class -- was "scarcity of labor." ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of American farmers
  are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form of tenancy;
  and the great majority of our people are landless men, without right to employ
  their own labor and without stake in the land they still foolishly speak of
  as their country. This is the reason why the army of the unemployed has appeared
  among us, why by pauperism has already become chronic, and why in the tramp
  we have in more dangerous type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>These recurring spasms of business stagnation; these long-drawn periods
  of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do not come from our
  treatment of money; are not caused and are not to be cured by changes of tariffs.
  Protection is a robbery of labor, and what is called free trade would give
  some temporary relief, but speculation in land would only set in the stronger,
  and at last labor and capital would again resist, by partial cessation, the
  blackmail demanded for their employment in production, and the same round would
  be run again. There is but one remedy, and that is what is now known as the
  single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and capital, and of all
  taxes upon their processes and products, and the taking of economic rent, the
  unearned increment which now goes to the mere appropriator, for the payment
  of public expenses. Charity can merely demoralize and pauperize, while that
  indirect form of charity, the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing
  public expenses and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
  If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by dynamite
  and kerosene.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>But there is no need for charity; no need for "making work." All that
  is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural demand for
  the products of work from availing itself of the natural supply. Remove them
  today, and every unemployed man in the country could find for himself employment
  tomorrow, and his "effective demand" for the things he desires would infuse
  new life into every subdivision of business and industry, even that of the
  dentist, the preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The country is suffering from "scarcity of employment." But let anyone
  today attempt to employ his own labor or that of others, whether in making
  two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or in erecting a factory, and
  he will at once meet the speculator to demand of him an unnatural price for
  the land he must use, and the tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing
  labor as if he had committed a crime. The common-sense way to cure "scarcity
  of employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of employment
  and to impose in their stead the tax that would end speculation in land.&nbsp; ...</small><small> <a

  <p> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent government and the
    other of inefficient government, but in all other respects alike. Suppose
    you are hunting for a place of residence and find a suitable site in the
    town of good government. For simplicity of illustration let us suppose that
    the land there is not sold outright but is let upon ground rent. You meet
    the owner of the lot you have selected and ask him his terms. He replies:</p>
  <p>&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;Why,
    I can get just as good a site in that other town for a hundred dollars a
    year.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But if you build a house
    there and it catches fire it will burn down; they have no fire department.
    If you go out after dark you will be 'held up' and robbed; they have no police
    force. If you ride out in the spring, your carriage will stick in the mud
    up to the hubs, and if you walk you may break your legs and will be lucky
    if you don t break your neck; they have no street pavements and their sidewalks
    are dangerously out of repair. When the moon doesn't shine the streets are
    in darkness, for they have no street lights. The water you need for your
    house you must get from a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our
    town it is different. We have a splendid fire department, and the best police
    force in the world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity;
    our sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
    equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this town

    worth a hundred and fifty dollars a year more for a building site here than
    over in that poorly governed town?&quot;</p>

    is built and the assessor visits you officially, what would be the conversation
    if your sense of the fitness of things were not warped by familiarity with
    false systems of taxation? Would it not be something like what follows?</p>
  <p>&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks the assessor.</p>
  <p>&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</p>
  <p>&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise your property for
    taxation.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What for? Is
    not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire department? Are
    not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world? Do
    not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks, and electric
    street lights, and a first class water supply? Don't you suppose these things
    cost something? And don't you think you ought to pay your share?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or less calmness; &quot;I do have
    the benefit of these things, and I do think that I ought to pay my share
    toward supporting them. But I have already paid my share for this year. I
    have paid it to the owner of this lot. He charges me two hundred and fifty
    dollars a year -- one hundred and fifty dollars more than I should pay or
    he could get but for those very benefits. He has collected my share of this
    year's expense of maintaining town improvements; you go and collect from
    him. If you do not, but insist upon collecting from me, I shall be paying
    twice for these things, once to him and once to you; and he won't be paying
    at all, but will be making money out of them, although he derives the same

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even if land value taxation does not yield the revenue that is desired,
    this is no argument against shifting as much public revenue as possible to
    rent-based
      sources. Public revenue from land values is the most complete application
    of &#8220;supply-side&#8221; economic
      policy. Supply-side policy attempts to increase production and the supply
    of goods by decreasing costs, such as by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive
      regulations and barriers to trade. A complete tax shift, away from taxing
    production
      to taxing land values, is the ultimate supply-side policy, since it removes
      the excess economic burden of taxation. The public collection of land rent
      is thus the ultimate in tax reform.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would also result in a substantial reduction in the
    cost of government. The administrative cost of land value taxes would be
    less than
      that of existing property taxes (which require a greater inspection of
    buildings and improvements), and the cost of enforcing income and sales taxes
    would be
      eliminated. By improving economic growth and allowing workers to keep all
    the money they earn, land value taxation would result in higher incomes,
    reducing
      the demand for government welfare programs. Decentralization, privatization,
      and the elimination of wasteful government programs would further reduce
    the amount needed to fund government. ... </p>
  <p>The United States is a federation of states (and Indian-nation reservations),
    with many government functions such as criminal law, education, and local
    services provided by the states. Since the federal income tax was enacted
    in 1913, taxation and authority have shifted increasingly to the federal
    government.</p>
  <p>In 1902, federal taxes represented 37 percent of total revenue to governments
    at all levels.45 By 2002, federal taxes represented 67 percent of the government
    revenue pie.46 The share taken by state governments rose from 11.4 percent
    in 1902 to 21.5 percent in 1986. Local governments&#8217; share fell from
    51.3 percent in 1902 to 13.7 percent in 1986.</p>
  <p>The change in the share of tax revenues taken by each level of government
    has occurred in large part because of the relative ease of increasing income
    taxes at the federal level, and the relative difficulty of increasing local
    and state taxes. Taxpayers find it much easier to respond to changes in state
    and local taxes, by moving to lower-tax communities. It is far more difficult
    to avoid taxes imposed by the federal government &#8212; especially since
    U.S. citizens are taxed even if they are abroad.</p>
  <p>Revenue-sharing from the federal government to the states is, in effect,
    a tax cartel among the states, collusion to tax the population and then divide
    the funds among the states. Taxation at the federal level also encourages
    spending by the federal government instead of the states, so now we have
    federal departments and agencies for education, housing, health and welfare,
    energy, and other fields that once were local, state, or private-sector matters.</p>
  <p>Local and state governments, once willing to go along with the federal government&#8217;s
    tax-and-revenue-sharing scheme, are beginning to realize centralized taxing
    brings with it centralized authority, dramatically reducing local control.
    Revenue-sharing comes with strings attached: Local and state governments
    must abide by federal government mandates in order to obtain the funds, taken
    from their residents in the first place. Revenue-sharing allows the federal
    government to sidestep the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides
    that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved
    to the people and the states.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
    Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
    and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of
    local public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
    don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
    to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not taxed
    if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation reduces
    the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
    funds in an enterprise.</p>
  <p>When public finance is based on land value taxation, government revenues
    flow up, instead of trickling down from the federal government to the states
    and then to local governments. Real estate taxes today are assessed and collected
    primarily by county governments; under a system of land value taxation, funds
    raised would flow up from the counties to the states, and only then to the
    federal government.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>      Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city, state
        or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing with
        the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
        expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. <strong>Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. </strong>The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied
      by any political unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually
      more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.

        neighborhoods. In places that do have the land tax, i.e., Australia and

  Land Values</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economic market rental value
of land should be sufficient to
finance public services and to obviate the need for raising revenue
from taxes, such as income or wage taxes; sales, commodity or
value-added taxes; and taxes on buildings, machinery and industry.
Public revenue should not be supplied by taxes on people and
enterprise until after all of the available revenue has been first
collected from the natural and community created value of land. Only
if land rent were insufficient would it be necessary to collect any
taxes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent, by
the public for supplying public
needs, returns the advantage an individual receives from the
exclusive use of a land site to the balance of the community, who
along with nature, contributed to its value and allow its exclusive
use. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What are the factors that cause
land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>the growth of communities and peoples'
competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
people and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the
responsibility of
the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. The community added to the market value of land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that we face is that
cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Efficient land use appeals to all
people because it surpasses the
political constraints of most people. Everybody understands that the
earth belongs equally to all people. They want a clean environment on
earth and to leave a healthy inheritance to the future generations,
regardless of their political viewpoints.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The major function of a competent
city government is to provide
good community services by collecting the land rent created within
the community to ensure the efficient use of land and equal
opportunities for all of its citizens. Transportation is an important
function of government which would facilitate the creation of a
compact city, where people can easily find the facilities they desire
for education, commerce, religion and recreation. Good
land use, with the freedom of individuals to achieve the highest and
best use of land, would ensure a desirable community. A compact city
would reduce the need to invade the wilderness and devastate the
environment. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC
REVENUE</b>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Adam Smith, in The Wealth of
Nations, suggested that any "tax"
should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
efficiently performed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
meet:</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Light on the
production of wealth, and does not impede
or reduce production; <br>
2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
understand; <br>
3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for corruption,
and provides adequate revenue; <br>
4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received, impartial,
and just. </small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
land rent is the only revenue
source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new inventions and more
efficient ways of producing goods are
discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the rent of land is taken for
public purposes production and
distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25%. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)</span></small>&nbsp;</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to preserve the
environment, it is necessary and possible
to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
all of the market rent of land.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Studies have been produced that
demonstrate that communities
prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
the community should collect
let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
values.</b></small></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>People
will come to a well run community because they will be
better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
services.</small></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This
revenue can best be procured when the community recaptures
the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
of, and provided by, the local city government</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
land rent as their primary source
of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals who work to create wealth
should be allowed to keep what
they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
consumption occurs.</span> Investment capital is formed which is used
to
produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
results.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
what he or she produces, but no
one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
users are willing to pay.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the value of
land rent exceeds the
community's needs for public
services a method of dispensing of the revenue can easily be
found. To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has special
benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
emergencies.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">An
ethical proposal might be to
then divide the excess revenue
that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
the remaining revenue.</span> This is similar to the method used in
Alaska
and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
an important source of public
revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of land can be estimated
with an acceptable accuracy, at
a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
responsibility of good government. <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Anti-governmentalists often

extravagance. Georgist tax policies, on the contrary, help save
public funds in at least two general ways.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span

many public costs, like welfare, obviously, crime-fighting, and,
ultimately, putting down civil disturbances and insurrections.</span> </small>  </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">b.
Putting the unemployed
to work also raises demand and, by so doing, helps make plain to all
the desirability of unleashing supply.</span> Now, supply in some
industries is deliberately held down to support prices. U.S.
agriculture is a good example: supply restraints are transparent
because they are matters of public law. The U.S.D.A. pays landowners to
fallow some 60 million acres each year, to raise food and clothing
prices. Under Georgist policy those acres would go to work producing
food and paying taxes, both.</small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small> </small> </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">c.
Georgist policies
obviate subeconomic extensions of public works, which now are pushed by
the powerful combination of land speculators seeking increments, the
jobless seeking work, and the homeless seeking shelter.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Georgist policies open up the
naturally better land to settlement, thus relieving the pressure to
invade flood plains, steep erosive slopes, flammable brushlands,
wetlands, and other places that soak up heavy public funds to reach,
develop, service, and protect.</span></small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same time, these policies
deflate the "rent-seeking"
motivations of land speculators to sue for state and federal aid. Under
George's scheme, the unearned increments secured by
"rent-seeking" lobbying for public works would be taxed away.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the longer run it seems
reasonable to expect that more genuine

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>

Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Who has the
authority to collect land rent?</b>
</small><br>
<small>Many libertarians struggle with the legitimate question of how
any
governing body achieves rightful jurisdiction in a community, and we
join them in opposing collection by such super-statist organizations
as the United Nations, which is substantially a federation of
tyrannies. However, royal libertarians raise the question selectively
and rhetorically in regard to community collection of land rents.
They acknowledge that there must be courts to settle, among other
things, property disputes. It seems rather obvious that whatever
entity has authority to rule on who gets the land also has authority
to rule on who gets the land rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Fear of a funded
government</b></small><br>
<small>There is also a well founded libertarian concern that land rent
could provide funds enough to support a corrupt and oppressive
government. Most libertarian supporters of the governmental
collection of land rent therefore fall into two camps. One would give
the people power to limit how much money the government can take, but
would stipulate that all such money come entirely from ground rents
and natural resource severance royalties. The other would take the
full rent, but would stipulate that the government can still only
spend what the citizens authorize it to spend. The rest would be
distributed on a per-capita basis.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Ending excuses
for big government</b></small><br>
<small>Much of the government spending to which libertarians
strenuously
object is made necessary by its taxing productivity instead of land
values.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The property tax falls mostly on
improvements, so less housing is
built, giving the government an excuse to build public housing.
Profits are taxed, leading to less employment and giving government
an excuse to spend money on economic stimulus projects. Family income
is taxed to the point that they have difficulty buying a house or
sending their children to college, so government institutes
subsidized mortgages and student loans.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the indirect effects are
substantial. Land speculations gone
sour chew up inner cities, so poor people turn to crime (if drug
selling and prostitution be crimes) and the government gets an excuse
to beef up the police state.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Politically connected real estate
interests see that they can buy
up land in the boondocks for a pittance and then get other taxpayers
to build them a superhighway, increasing the value of their holdings
by orders of magnitude. With land value tax they would have
ultimately paid for their own highway or more likely would not have
had it built in the first place.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even welfare increases do not stay
in the hands of welfare
recipients, but are quickly greeted by higher rent demands from
ghetto landlords. (The War on Poverty did little to end poverty, but
it did a lot to enrich absentee owners of poor communities.)</small></p>

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
    One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to use
    it. Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability
    to control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from
    the increase in its price. <strong>With most of the geo-rent tapped for public
    revenue, the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the
    economy, since with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land
    would instead go to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide
    better training.</strong></p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If
    a landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to
    pass on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would
    be invisible to renters, the link between using public services and paying
    for them would be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent,
    so that link is there. If government revenue is wasted, then indeed this
    does not generate rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits
    would reduce land value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue
    would come from the landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no
    different than the situation today; poor folks pay little or no income tax
    and no property tax, and typically they get government assistance. This is
    an argument not against the use of rent, but in favor of privatizing government
    programs. In the private sector, the link between ownership and control is
    stronger. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

 style="font-weight: bold;">THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS</span>:
OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Apart from Free Trade, the great
economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes
now not as a document of historic interest but as a challenge to
politicians, indeed to the entire electorate, to consider again the
causes of poverty and the basic issues of social and economic justice.
Perhaps current disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that
if justice in the community can only be achieved at the expense of
individual liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing
taxation and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of
the individual are complementary and that taxes may be raised without
undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major contribution
to current political and economic thought. Indeed it deserves a place
in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and yearning for a society
in which the genius of every person would be nurtured and the liberty
of every person respected. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>...

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>It strengthened public revenues
and at the same time promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Jessica Matthews, now with the
Council on Foreign Relations,
recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a now familiar
sequence, developers reach for the
cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in
behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage systems and
schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are
left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily
outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because residential development
can't meet the public bills, local
governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
providing an incentive for new development.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Years of such leap-frogging
construction devours land at an
astonishing pace. Now if the full social opportunity cost of land
occupancy were charged to landholders, the reward of (and incentive
for) speculation would be obliterated, and land now locked up by
speculators would be transferred to users. Users would employ more
labor and engender more capital development instead of seeing it
locked up in wasted space.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Absent adequate taxation the
regions at the periphery are the
first developed, just as Ms. Matthews observes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economics profession is only
now coming to recognize its
responsibility for what it has wrought. Economists are coming to
recognize the costs of sprawl, and studies show how astonishingly
inefficient the suburban lifestyle is. One review of the literature
on the subject of comparative development costs published by the
Urban Land Institute revealed that <span style="font-weight: bold;">"houses
built in sprawling
developments may cost 40 to 400 percent more to serve than if they
were located close to major facilities, were clustered in contiguous
areas, and incorporated a variety of housing types."&nbsp; </span></small><small>...

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Georgists today are also
frequently very divided on the role of
government in society. Many are vehemently anti-government and are
subscribers to libertarian views;<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small>
others are rather conventional progressives in their belief and
confidence in the role of government to provide the full array of
public services which are typically found in modern democratic
societies. The axis of Georgist thought cuts completely across
conventional political party lines as a consequence: one finds hardline
conservatives and progressive &#8220;liberals&#8221; united only in the view that
economic land rent should not be left in the hands of titleholders.
Most would use such revenues to finance the support of government
services, abolishing completely the wide array of income, sales,
corporate franchise and other taxes that are currently used, keeping
only environmental fees and user fees.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Adherents of minimalist government believe that any extra rent
revenue
collected from holders of land should be returned to people
individually in the form of a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s dividend.&#8221; Given the choice of
using the full amount of surplus rent to support government services or
collecting only a portion, many libertarian Georgists would collect it
all; leaving it otherwise in the hands of property holders, they
believe, has more negative consequences than not collecting it. Not
collecting the economic rent, so they argue, is worse than throwing it
&#8220;into the sea&#8221; for all its distorting and destructive consequences.
Others advocates would prefer to collect it not for financing the
services of government but rather to distribute it as a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s
dividend.&#8221; There is widespread recognition of the destructive
consequences of the failure to collect land rent. Some Georgists would
allow a token amount of rent to be retained by landholders so as to
facilitate real estate markets above and beyond what might otherwise be
realized.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because a tax on land is
essentially a flat rate percent levied on a
base of assessed full market value, it is simple and easy for people to
understand. On account of that attribute, a tax on land value is easily
visible and is perceived by the public to be fair. Finally, now that
applied computer technology can be used to accurately assess the value
of land whether or not it is improved, one of the last traditional
objections to the administrative feasibility to land value taxation has
been allayed. All this enhances the legitimacy of government. The tax
is therefore not simply efficient from the narrow measure of tax
efficiency as described above. It is efficient also in the broader
sense, by its ability to foster sounder government performance, better
community relations, more livable community configurations, and
enhanced social productivity.&nbsp; It is not just from the standpoint
of tax theory alone that a tax on land should be evaluated.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I<small>n the Georgist view, this
economic rent is the public&#8217;s birthright,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>and
the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises <span style="font-weight: bold;">approximately a third of
the economy as it is currently
calculated.</span><small><span

in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,
for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96)&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Rents are a taxable surplus.
I estimate that this taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the
national income in most nations with market economies, and more in
resource-rich nations. ...</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;2. The value of rent is huge. Every economy produces a
large
excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some of it
goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not part of
the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return of
capital. ... </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;3. Rent will become huger yet when you abate taxes
presently
levied on production and exchange, because these now depress the rent
of land. That is, in a tax-free market economy, the benefit of abating
present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The taxable surplus
simply shifts from one form to another. </small><br>
<small>This is more than a simple shift of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You gain
more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production.</span>
Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Monetarists" warn you that
"there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods.</span></small><br>
<small>4. Some of the benefit of abating
existing taxes will
lodge in <span style="font-weight: bold;">higher after-tax wage rates,
rather than higher rents. ... </span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;5. Many varieties of natural resources generate rents.
City
land is the greatest single source. For example, one city, Vancouver,
contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a province of
934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France. ...</small> <small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What happens when a state
radically
slashes its property tax?
Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no need
for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To read
your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened since
California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Our school support fell from #5,
nationally, to #40 in 1985 when last seen, still falling. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>County road
maintenance is down to where my county (Riverside) is repaving its
roads at an annual rate of once every 130 years. Once in 20 years is
recommended here, and up north you generally need higher frequency.
You can't just build infrastructure and then stop paying for it, it's
a perpetual commitment. Thanks to urban sprawl, a high fraction of
our population now depends on these county roads.</small></li>
  <li><small>In 1978 we had a surplus in Sacramento. Since then we have
raised
business taxes, income taxes, sales taxes and gas taxes, but go broke
every June. Now our State bond rating is last among the states. One
of our richest counties (Orange) has gone bankrupt; Los Angeles is on
the brink of it, saving itself by closing emergency rooms and
hospitals that serve as a last resort for the uninsured poor.</small></li>
  <li><small>The private sector is doing badly, too. Raising income
taxes,
business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an economy;
they are all a drag on work and enterprise. 
    </small></li>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Our income per capita was down
from #7 to #12 among the states by 1992, then fell some more. From
1992-94, California was one of three states where median household
income fell.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Our unemployment rate is 9%, 50% higher than the
national mean of 6%. 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>Our poverty rate is 18%, compared to 14.5%
nationally. 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>Not surprisingly, therefore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
only government function
that grows now is building and operating prisons.</span>      </small></li>
    <li><small>One of our few
rebounding industries is cinema, the art of escaping from reality: we
excel at that. Another thriving activity is that of auctioning off
used machinery for export to the east.</small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><small>In 1993 there was net outmigration (including
international
migration) from this state that has symbolized American growth since
time immemorial. It is unheard of. 426,000 people were lost, nearly
2% of the population. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a
watershed change: imagine of all
states California, America's trend-setter, our El Dorado, The Golden
State, our Horn of Plenty, the safety-valve for job-seekers and
retirees and entrepreneurs from everywhere, the end of the rainbow,
losing population! It's almost enough to make a person click off the
TV and think!</span></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our fall of income per capita is
greater than appears from a
purely monetary measure. Real pay (in contrast $) has fallen more
because of the drastic rise in shelter prices. In San Francisco,
shelter takes 50 percent of the median income, with many other
cities, especially coastal ones, not far behind. It is unusual to
find livable quarters for less than $600 per month. The median home
price rose 163 percent during the 1980s to $258,000 (that is just the
median - the mean is higher). These prices are part of the C.O.L. of
all renters and new buyers, a part not fully incorporated in standard
CPI measures.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some cities are in desperate
straits. In 1976 San Bernardino was
chosen an "AllAmerican City, A City on the Go." Go it did: today 40
percent of its people are on welfare!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California is earthquake country.
But it has always renewed
itself. It was different after the Northridge quake in the San
Fernando Valley, January 1994. This is the uppermiddle neighborhood
of Los Angeles, but now large pockets of ruined buildings remain,
unreconstructed, inhabited by vagrants and criminals: an instant
Bronx West. These ominous blighted sections portend the spread of
more blight.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
should give one pause. It is the
expectable consequence of what
the voters did. They rejected the concept of taxing inert wealth in
favor of the alternative: taxing liquidity, cash flow, work,
production and commerce. </span>The predictable result has been to
inhibit
economic activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.
They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California had a construction boom
in the late 1980s, but it was
not healthy. It was marked by extreme scatter and instability.
Downtown L.A. was to become a great new financial capital. But it now
has nearly the highest office vacancy rate in the U.S., with of
course a high rate of builder bankruptcies. Speculative builders were
led on to over-build, in part by anticipated higher land rents and
prices. This Lorelei effect was magnified by national income-tax
provisions luring on speculative builders. But we have to ask why
California fell harder than other states, even with the
object-lessons of the oil states in clear view.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>David Shulaman tersely summarized <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
distributive effects of
Prop. 13 </span>as he left us to become Chief Equity Strategist for
Salamon
Brothers in Manhattan: <span style="font-weight: bold;">"it breached
the social compact." </span>Alienation
is the result, and the results of alienation are the Rodney King
riots, arson and looting. (The consistent leader in death rate from
violent causes is New Mexico, with the lowest property tax in the
nation.) The Watts riots, you may object, preceded Prop. 13, and you
are right. However, the Watts riots were part of a national epidemic.
By 1967 there were riots with arson and looting in 70 or more
American cities. The Rodney King riots were endemic to California,
and they spread over a much wider area of Los Angeles than the Watts
riots did. The looters and arsonists were not all black, and the
targets were not all white, but mainly Korean-Americans who just
happened to be there minding their stores.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conventional wisdom now blames our
California bust on the end of
the Cold War. Surely that is a factor, but as a casual explanation,
it is too pat, too easy and too convenient. It shifts the load onto
impersonal historical forces - the Marxist world view. Let us see if
it can survive analysis.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare
today with 1945. Los
Angeles' economy depended much more
on The Hot War, 1940-1945, than it every did on The Cold War.</span>
Los
Angeles' wartime boom had swelled its population as no other great
city, 1940-45. After 1945 the U.S. pulled the plug on defense
spending, more than today. Jane Jacobs, in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Economy of Cities</span>,
tells us what happened to military spending in Los Angeles after
1945. It lost 3/4 of its aircraft workers, and 80 percent of its
shipbuilders. It lost its military and naval overseas supply and
replacement businesses. Troops stopped funneling through. It got
worse: petroleum and cinema and citrus, its traditional exports, all
declined.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pundits
then forecast a regional
collapse, but Los Angeles boomed
instead. </span>The wartime immigrants stayed. They formed creative,
innovative small businesses in large numbers, giving L.A. its
deserved reputation for having the most dynamic, flexible, adaptable
industrial base in the nation. Besides exporting goods, L.A. also
became more self-contained, providing itself with more of the goods
it previously imported. How could this be? Angelenos had access to
land, the basis of all supply and demand in any economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Between 1945-50, one-eighth of all
new businesses started in the
U.S. were established in L.A. They were small, creative, flexible,
miscellaneous, and too varied and dynamic to classify. No Linnaeus
could sort them in static conventional boxes; they were the despair
traditional economic geographers and base theorists who were at a
loss to explain the region's thriving economy. The new Angelenos
stayed and started producing everything for themselves, some things
previously imported, and others never seen before.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Eastern firms established branch
plants. Top eastern students came
to California's great university system and stayed behind to take
jobs and make careers here, then sent their children through
California's excellent public schools. California became famous for
supporting outstanding higher education, highways, water supplies,
public health, public safety, and other public services, all without
repelling business by taxation. There was a regional "El Dorado
Effect" as demand and supply grew together. Growing local demand
allowed for economies of scale serving local markets. Food and
shelter were cheap and abundant. Land for business was accessible,
providing a basis for the California self-contained phenomenon. A
"continental tilt" developed in both interest rates and wage rates,
drawing in eastern capital and labor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why is that not
continuing
today?</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The invisible, pervasive change is
due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using Gwartney's Rule of Thumb (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners are only taxed now if
they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. A handful of
oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out. This helps us segue from being at the cutting edge
of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model
to the AL model - with little relief in sight.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was different then? We had
high property tax rates, but they
were more focused on land than now, less on new buildings. Another
obvious difference was the lower burdens of sales tax, business tax,
and income tax. California was more hospitable to Georgist thinking
than perhaps any other state, shown by its long run of Georgist
political action in the prior thirty years. Most people today are
totally ignnorant of this subject. It has been deleted from our
history books. Here is a brief review.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Several states had "single-tax"
movements and initiatives,
1910-14, but most of them petered out. In California they continued
through 1924, and then popped up again in 1934-38. In 1934 the "EPIC"
campaign of Upton Sinclair included a strong Georgist element - he
proposed the establishment of new factories and farms on idle land.
At the same time, Jackson Ralston was pursuing a pure land tax
initiative, 1934-38.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sinclair and Ralston lost. But the
very existence of such
political action in California, when the movement was torpid
elsewhere, tells us a lot. It reveals a large matrix of supportive
voters and workers, with effective leaders, to whom politicians
(including elected County Assessors) would naturally respond by
focusing on land assessments. Politicians survive by accommodating
and absorbing dissident movements. Even while "losing," such
campaigns raise consciousness of the issue. Thus,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> in California,
1917, land value constituted 72 percent of the assessment roll for
property taxation.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This remained the California norm
for years. California was
different. Even into the 1960s, Sacramento County elected an avowed
single-tax Assessor, Irene Hickman; San Diego County harbored an
active movement for raising land assessments. The Henry George
Schools of San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento were
the most active such schools in the country: four in one state, when
most had none. State Senator Al Rodd, Chair of the Senate Finance
Committee, held hearings and tried to push land tax legislation
through his Committee in the 1960s and early 1970s. He assigned a
staffer, Jack Massen, to spend a year working out the detailed
effects on intergovernmentai relations. Assemblyman Dr. William
Filante, from a base of Georgist support in Marin County, picked up
the torch too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing
prosperity and growth up to 1978. It
had the resilience to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945
and still grow "explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we
suffered a string of reverses. The timing, along with a priori
causative analysis, plus direct observations too numerous to review
support an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.

welfare, but they never cure the economic disease.</span> Others see

Maurie Fabrikant: <a
 href="../docs/Fabrikant_Letter_Swan.html">An
Open Letter to Wayne Swan</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage,
"Idle lands cause idle hands" is clearly demonstrated in Australia ...
and elsewhere.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The only possible "winners" in
this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is
now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum
is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays." How big is this periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented - would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded! ... <a

    <small> But their projects did not at all tally.</small><br>
