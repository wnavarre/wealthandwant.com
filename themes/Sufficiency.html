    <p>Real estate is a much larger share of the American economic picture than
      most of us realize.&nbsp; Further, land values are a much higher share
      of real estate value than most of us
    realize.
    Local
    assessments
    tend
    to underweight
    land and
    overweight
    improvements
    (see
  the page on <a href="Assessment.html">assessment</a> for why and how).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Were we to move to land value taxation, there is good reason to believe
      that our economies, local and national, would benefit, and there would
      be widespread prosperity.&nbsp; This would reduce the need for much of
      the spending necessitated by the large population of struggling people
      within our society. </p>
    <p>Henry George called land value taxation the Single Tax.&nbsp; Today, most
      Georgists believe that while a tax on land rent rent should be our primary
      tax, it will probably no longer be sufficient to meet all revenue needs.&nbsp; But
      that doesn't reduce the moral imperative to make it the primary tax &#8212;      the
      first tax, the underlying tax.&nbsp;It is probably sufficient to
      meet about 2/3 of our revenue needs.&nbsp; If
      it alone isn't sufficient to meet the spending needs of government, then
      it
      can
      be <em>supplemented</em>      by
      some of the taxes we rely on today whose perversity and injustice this
      website documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; But let's tax first things first.</p>

    <p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
      have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought about
      under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth. It
      is the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes
      a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth. Let
      us work by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against it,
      it is hard pulling and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take some
rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.*</p>

      <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar
          with economic terminology may assume, the whole amount paid for the
          use of real estate. It is only that part of such amount which is paid
          for the use of the bare land or site employed, exclusive of the payment
          for the use of any buildings or other improvements on it. H. G. B.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
      need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount
      of land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes,
      land, no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held,
      would be really common property, and every member of the community would
      participate in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
    <p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily
      be increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition
      into practical form by proposing --</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land
          values.</em></strong></p>
    <p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
      but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of
      the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country, even
      the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear
      the entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries it
      is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place
      all taxes upon the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds
      the present governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount
      demanded in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses
      and rent advances. But this is so natural and easy a matter, that it may
      be considered as involved, or at least understood, in the proposition to
      put all taxes on the value of land. That is the first step upon which the
      practical struggle must be made. When the hare is once caught and killed,
      cooking him will follow as a matter of course. When the common right to
      land is so far appreciated that all taxes are abolished save those which
      fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more than is necessary to induce
      them to collect the public revenues being left to individual landholders.</p>
    <p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds
      lodgment sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but
      there are few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first,
      or even for a long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is a
        real antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over
        the idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly to
        tax them.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
        capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
        poorer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
      there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature,
      education, and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong
      which in every civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty
      and want, will not die without a bitter struggle. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/07_Simplicity_Introducing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    or that he has got from the man who did produce it; but when you pay a man
    for land, what are you paying him for? You are paying for something that
    no man has produced; you pay him for something that was here before man was,

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p><strong>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</strong></p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <div align="left"><font size="-1">But to ascertain the total cost to the people

      May 1, 1892, there should be added to the taxes assessed upon them what
      it cost them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the use of the
      land, being the net ground rent, which I estimate at four per cent on the
      land value.</font></div>

      4 per cent = 5.29 per cent.</font></div>

      by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by charitable,
      literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount of the value of
      land so held as returned by the assessors for the year 1892 is $60,626,171.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within
      the city should be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution
      of the public burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here.
      There is good reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are
      assessed to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value.
      As an indication of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
      October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></div>

      per cent of their true market value.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved
      property and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think
      $500,000,000 to be a fair estimate of the land values of Boston. Making

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>

        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></strong></p>

  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>

  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>

        land. When I described the matter in that way, the story attracted no

        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>

        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>

        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>

  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?</em></p>
  <p>A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
        of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
        potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
        not is as yet an unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised
        from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while
        any land value remains in private possession. Until land values are exhausted
        the taxation of labor cannot be excused.</p>
  <p><em>Q4. What disposition would you make of the revenues that exceeded the needs
    of government?</em></p>
  <p>A. The people who ask this question ought to settle it with those who want
      to know whether the single tax would yield revenue enough. I do not believe
      that public revenues under the single tax would exceed the just needs of
      economical government; in better highways, better sidewalks, better wharves,
      better schools, better public service of various kinds, we should find sufficient
      demand for all our revenues. But the question of deficiency or surplus is
      one to be met and disposed of when it arises. The present question is the
      wisdom and the justice of applying land values to common use, as far as they
      will go or as much of them as may be needed as the case may prove to be.</p>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em></p>
  <p>A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
      government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
      each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the
    nation, there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would
    be still
      further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
      pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
      be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to
    the second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be
    wiped
      out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
      values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation.
    And this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
      in taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

  <p><em>Q36. How much does this particular form of privilege amount to?</em><br>
    A. It amounted for 1914 to approximately $40 million for Boston and more
      than $200 million for Greater New York.</p>
  <p><em>Q57. Would the single tax yield sufficient revenue for all government purposes,
    local, state, and national?</em><br>
    A. Careful estimates by Mr. Thomas G. Shearman indicate that all present
    taxes amount to not much more than one half of the annual site value of the
    land. But he said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The honest needs of public government grow faster than population and fully
        as fast as wealth itself. Local taxation will increase rapidly; and it ought
        to do so..... This does not imply that ground rent will not be sufficient
        to supply many, possibly all, of those additions to human happiness which
        Henry George has pictured in such glowing words. But such extensions of the

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;If taxation is unnecessary, what is to take its place? Government and
      its functions are increasingly expensive. They require a lot of money. Where
      is it to come from?&quot; The answer may be placed in the form of a second
      proposition:</p>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village, city,
      state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing income,
      growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
      governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.<font size="+1"><strong>  ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>An authority on municipal taxation estimates the present economic rent of
      the land embraced in the City of New York at from $350,000,000 to $400,000,000.
      Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding the receipts from licenses,
      fees and fines, New York City should receive, of her own income, enough to
      pay all her own legitimate bills, to make her proper contributions to county
      and state and build a new subway or its equivalent every year.</p>
  <p>And this with nobody paying a dollar of taxes, or, if we except the fines,
      a dollar that he was not ready and glad to pay for his own advantage.</p>
  <p>We repeat, this is not taxation; but for the sake of those who cannot grasp
      the idea of public revenue without taxation, let us state the matter in their
      own language.</p>
  <p>Think of a tax which both assesses itself and collects itself, which burdens
      no one, which is paid voluntarily, and only by those who do so for their
    own profit or other advantage. Compare this with our present system of taxes,
    which
      everyone despises, which can be collected in full only from the very scrupulous
      and from the helpless, from trust funds of widows and orphans, or from
    estates which lie naked before the tax gatherer on the records of court;
    a system which
      drives men of property from state to state and town to town in flight from
      the assessor, and well-nigh forces many worthy citizens to practices of
    evasion which must make it hard for them to look into their own mirrors during
    the
      season for &quot;Correction of Assessments;&quot; there can be but one
      verdict upon such comparison. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Replacing Existing
Taxes</b>
</small><br>
<small>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the public
treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing
sources of public revenue.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those who contribute labor to productive processes should
be allowed to keep the wages that result from their labor.</small></li>
  <li><small>Those whose saving makes the creation of capital possible
should be allowed to keep the interest that accrues from the use of
capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>But there is no one who has a corresponding claim to the
return to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and
other opportunities assigned by government ought to be the primary
source of government revenue.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While one might call such fees
"taxes," we consider that
designation inappropriate, because the word "tax" connotes an
exaction from someone of something to which he or she has a just
claim, and we deny that there are such just claims with respect to
land. We expect that the collection of fees for the full value of
opportunities assigned by governments would provide adequate revenue
for all necessary government expenditures.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b>
</small><br>
<small>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their
embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for
the use of government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in which our ideas
promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WOULD THERE be enough revenue
for the public sector? To address
this question, one should consider different types of public
activities separately. The type of public activity that can most
readily be financed by charges for exclusive access to natural
opportunities is local public services. When these are desired by
voters and provided efficiently, they tend to raise the rental value
of land by enough to pay for themselves, since a local public service
provides a benefit in a limited region, and people will bid up the
rental value of that land by the value of access to the
service.<font size="-2"><small><i>2 </i></small></font> Thus local
services can be
financed without even beginning to draw on the value of opportunities
provided by nature.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another broad area of public
spending is national defense. While
defense increases the value of land in a dangerous world, one might
reasonably hope that the need for defense spending would be greatly
reduced in a world that had adopted a general norm of acknowledging
the equal rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To the extent that defense costs
are raised when a nation becomes
a more attractive target-- because of increases in its stock of
capital or in the productivity of its citizens--it would be efficient
and not unreasonable to have an annual charge on capital and on
talent (an asset protection fee) to defray these costs. Such a fee
could be collected by a self-assessed tax. For capital, the tax
could be enforced by an obligation to sell the capital at the
self-assessed price. For talent, the tax could be enforced by a rule
that if a person was injured in an accident and wished to sue for
loss of earning power, the self-assessed value of the person's talent
would be the upper limit on the damages that could be claimed. It is
likely that a tax rate of two or three tenths of one percent per year
would suffice to fund the current level of U.S. defense spending. But I
would hope and expect that defense spending would fall
substantially. Between the reduced need for defense spending and an
efficient asset protection fee for the extra defense costs generated
by increases in capital and talent, it should be possible to finance
defense without exhausting the rental value of exclusive access to
natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The next major area of government
spending to consider is social
welfare programs-welfare, social security, unemployment compensation,
health insurance, etc. These would tend to raise the rental value of
land to some extent, but they would generally not raise land rents by
enough to pay for themselves, because their perceived value to
individuals tends to be highly disparate, so that those who value
access to such programs generally do not need to offer the full value
of such programs in rent premiums in order to get access to them. Thus
one cannot count on financing such programs by increases in
rent. The disparate value of public education to families makes this
public service subject to the same analysis.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Social welfare programs often have
an insurance component,
requiring payments by potential beneficiaries. If a program is so
close to a true insurance program that virtually everyone receives an
expected benefit that is as great as his or her assigned
contribution, then it can be financed by the assigned contributions,
and few will find the program objectionable. But social welfare
programs rarely approximate true insurance programs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The difficulty with financing
social welfare programs with rent
arises because those who design such programs usually seek to require
some people to pay more than the expected value of their benefits. In a
world that recognizes the equal rights of all persons to natural
opportunities and the right of any person to emigrate, social welfare
programs of this sort will be possible only to the extent that they
reflect shared community values. If such a program draws on shared
feelings of community responsibility, then people will be happy to
contribute part of their shares of the value of natural
opportunities, or even part of their earnings to such programs. If
an attempt is made to implement social insurance that exceeds what
people are prepared to pay for out of a sense of community, people
will tend to emigrate or secede. Thus in a world that operates on
principles of global economic justice, people will not be required to
pay for social insurance that they object to. If people have
potential needs that exceed what their fellow citizens are willing to
provide, they will have to buy their own insurance before the need
arises or rely on friends and family. If those who are never able to
provide for themselves are to be provided for in a just world of
limited generosity, parents will need to buy insurance against having
children with special needs before they conceive those children. But
I believe that feelings of community are sufficiently extensive that
those who need help would receive it. Unlike the present situation,
in a just world every person would have a share of the value of
exclusive access to natural opportunities, which would provide a
guaranteed income that would provide for many contingencies.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed? <strong>...
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair?&nbsp; </small><small><a

Ted Gwartney:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Gwartney_Estimating_LV.html">Estimating
Land Values</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economic market rental value
of land should be sufficient to
finance public services and to obviate the need for raising revenue
from taxes, such as income or wage taxes; sales, commodity or
value-added taxes; and taxes on buildings, machinery and industry.
Public revenue should not be supplied by taxes on people and
enterprise until after all of the available revenue has been first
collected from the natural and community created value of land. Only
if land rent were insufficient would it be necessary to collect any
taxes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent, by
the public for supplying public
needs, returns the advantage an individual receives from the
exclusive use of a land site to the balance of the community, who
along with nature, contributed to its value and allow its exclusive
use.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new inventions and more
efficient ways of producing goods are
discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the rent of land is taken for
public purposes production and
distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25%. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to preserve the
environment, it is necessary and possible
to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
all of the market rent of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Studies have been produced that
demonstrate that communities
prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
the community should collect
let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
values.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People will come to a well run
community because they will be
better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
services.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This revenue can best be procured
when the community recaptures
the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
of, and provided by, the local city government</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
land rent as their primary source
of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
results.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
what he or she produces, but no
one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
users are willing to pay.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the value of land rent exceeds
the community's needs for public
services a method of dispensing of the revenue can easily be
found. To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has special
benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
emergencies.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An ethical proposal might be to
then divide the excess revenue
that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
the remaining revenue. This is similar to the method used in Alaska
and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
an important source of public
revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of land can be estimated
with an acceptable accuracy, at
a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
responsibility of good government.<a

        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some economists agree taxing rent is efficient, but they claim the amount
      of revenue would be trivial. Salvatore and Diulio (1996), for example,
    have an exercise in their textbook: &#8220;What are the criticisms of the single-tax
      movement?&#8221; This was the movement for a single tax on land value, by the
      followers of Henry George. One criticism offered in that book is the assertion,
      provided with no evidence or citation, that &#8220;rents in the United States
      today amount to just about 1% of GNP,&#8221; ignoring the fact that the
      U.S. housing stock alone amounts to $15 trillion24 and research that indicates
      geo-rent
      is about 20 percent of GDP.</p>
  <p>There will always be critics who concoct a huge cost in getting assessments
      correct down to the last penny, or claim, without any evidence, that real
    estate is a trivial portion of the economy. Such critics date back to the
    days of
      Henry George, when the landed interests felt threatened by his ideas. Those
      opponents have been thoroughly rebutted in the book, Critics of Henry George
      (the latest edition edited in 2004 by Robert Andelson). The reasons for
    such attempts to falsify and trivialize rent-based public finance, and even
    to eliminate
      the land factor from economics, are chronicled and analyzed in The Corruption
      of Economics, especially in the chapter by Mason Gaffney, &#8220;Neo-classical
      Economics as a Stratagem against Henry George.&#8221; This negative viewpoint
      is perpetuated by academics who learn of land value taxation from misleading
      secondary sources, not bothering to dig any further. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    How much revenue?</p>
  <p>Total land values or land rents are not reported in national statistics.
    The U.S. national income accounts have a number only for the &#8220;rental
    income of persons,&#8221; which excludes rent obtained by corporations and
    the rental value of government land. This &#8220;rental income&#8221; is
    after all expenses, including property taxes, and so includes only a tiny
    fraction of the geo-rent.40</p>
  <p>The national rent in the United Kingdom has been estimated at 22 percent
    of national income, which exceeds the amount raised in that country by the
    income tax.41 Steven Cord42 estimated the annual economic rent of land in
    the U.S. in 1986 at $680 billion, 20 percent of national income, while Mike
    Miles (1990) arrived at a similar figure using data from the Bureau of Economic
    Analysis.43 The totals include government lands but do not include the increase
    in geo-rent that would occur with the elimination of market-hampering taxes.</p>
  <p><strong>Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation
      would provide about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local
      government
    revenue, which would be more than adequate for government spending if it
    did not include transfer payments. </strong>The taxable value of the land in the economy
    would increase over time for two reasons.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>      First, a shift from taxing production to taxing land values would eliminate
          the lost output due to taxes &#8212; about $1 trillion per year.44
          One-fifth of that would be rent, thus increasing rent by $300 billion.</li>
  <li>      Secondly, the economy would grow faster, which also would increase rent
        over time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>Tideman et al. (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain (measured
      in real dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land as could
      be financed by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion
      or 14% of NDP in 2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even
      if only a fraction of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes
      we know today to a geo-rent tax, the efficiency gains could be substantial.
      Some critics simply do not believe these results, without bothering to
      read them. I have not seen a rebuttal of Tideman&#8217;s calculation.</p>
    <p>  Even if land value taxation does not yield the revenue that is desired,
        this is no argument against shifting as much public revenue as possible
        to rent-based sources. Public revenue from land values is the most complete
        application of &#8220;supply-side&#8221; economic policy. Supply-side policy
        attempts to increase production and the supply of goods by decreasing costs,
        such as by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive regulations and barriers
        to trade. A complete tax shift, away from taxing production to taxing land
        values, is the ultimate supply-side policy, since it removes the excess
        economic burden of taxation. The public collection of land rent is thus
        the ultimate in tax reform.</p>
    <p>Land value taxation would also result in a substantial reduction in the
      cost of government. The administrative cost of land value taxes would be
      less than that of existing property taxes (which require a greater inspection
      of buildings and improvements), and the cost of enforcing income and sales
      taxes would be eliminated. By improving economic growth and allowing workers
      to keep all the money they earn, land value taxation would result in higher
      incomes, reducing the demand for government welfare programs. Decentralization,
      privatization, and the elimination of wasteful government programs would
      further reduce the amount needed to fund government. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>That public finance can be raised is a way that doesn't
undervalue
natural resources is, of course, a principle of all eco-taxes. But the
amount of revenue that can be raised, while still sending these strong
price signals, is also important to build infrastructure, social
welfare, education, environmental rehabilitation etc. The funds that
can be raised (or have been forgone thus far) from LVT are colossal by
any estimate. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The whole field of eco-taxes cannot be viewed in isolation of
the
fiscal imperatives to raise sufficient public finance, and here we see
another of the virtues of LVT. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If
people were required to pay the rental value of most natural resources
they used (as many, in fact, already do - to private owners) an
adjustment in patterns of consumption would follow. The environmental
goals would be achieved - at the cost of fiscal goals.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>However, under our present fiscal regime, governments are locked
into a
dependency on revenue from socially-harmful sources such as tobacco and
gambling, and cannot raise the taxes on them to levels that would "kill
the golden goose". Would such political realities change with
eco-taxes? Because of the inherent problem with most eco-taxes that
they reduce consumption of natural resources and therefore the tax
base, they give rise to a financial inducement to hold the tax rate at
a low enough rate so that a degree of pollution and wasteful
consumption can continue.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The effects of conventional eco-taxes sharply contrast with LVT
which instead is a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">renewable
and naturally-escalating source of revenue</span>
which arises when people are willing to pay for the use of land the
value of which is enhanced by natural resources which sustain healthy
lives. In other words, the success of a cleaner and more secure
environment would feed through to the land market, which measures the
attraction of the natural environment for living and working. Because
people are willing to pay higher rents for such benefits LVT, instead
of eroding revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">expands the public's
revenue base so that everybody enjoys the benefits of cleaning up and
conserving the natural environment.</span> Under the current system of
land tenure, the financial benefits of a cleaner environment accrue to
landowners.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>HOW LARGE IS THE GEO-RENT
TAX-BASE?<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span></small><small>One
of the pitfalls surrounding the idea of tapping geo-rent is that it is
closely associated with Henry George&#8217;s <span
 style="font-style: italic;">single</span>-tax
ideal society. Authors such as Mankiw (2004, 168) and McConnell and
Brue (2005, 300) point out that geo-rent taxation alone could not cover
the current levels of government spending. But that point works only as
a criticism of eliminating all taxes aside from geo-rent taxation, not
as a criticism of the principle of the idea of tapping geo-rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I have the further impression that many economists think that
geo-rent
is a tiny portion of GDP. That notion seems to lead some economists to
figure that even if geo-rent taxation is efficient, it is empirically
of small import. Dick Netzer (1998, 116) notes that the proposition
that &#8220;the potential revenue from land value taxation&#8221; is insufficient
&#8220;is widely held today.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a chapter entitled &#8220;rent, interest, and profits,&#8221; Salvatore
and
Diulio (1996) have an exercise, &#8220;What are the criticisms of the
single-tax movement?&#8221; One criticism offered is that &#8220;rents in the
United States today amount to just about 1% of GNP, while taxes are 25%
of GNP&#8221; (355).</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the official GDP accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
in the
Department of Commerce, the only category termed &#8220;rent&#8221; is "rental
income of persons," which in 2004 was put at an annualized estimate of
$150 billion, or less than 1.5% of GDP. This "rental income" is net of
expenses such as property taxes and mortgage interest, but the bulk of
such expenses are also returns on real estate which are being paid to
lenders and the government!</small><br>
<br>
<small>The BEA&#8217;s &#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; includes rental payments
for both
the sites and the buildings, adjusted down for the deprecation or
&#8220;capital consumption&#8221; of the improvements. Without capital consumption,
the rental income is $166 billion, and that includes the imputed
rentals of owner-occupied houses and the mortgage interest paid. This
&#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; is personal income, excluding the rental
income from land owned by corporations as well as the implicit
opportunity-cost rental value of land held by governments and nonprofit
agencies. Furthermore, corporate-owned land is severely understated in
corporate reports, because land is valued at the historical purchase
price, not current value.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That economists would believe that the GDP rental income figures
comes
anywhere close to being the total land rent is quite remarkable. Other
official data come closer to the actual geo-rent. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the Department of Labor reported that consumer units
spent an average of $13,283 on housing in 2002, one third of total
spending (BLS, 2004), including the imputed rental of owner-occupied
dwellings. The BLS reports 112,108,000 "consumer units" (households),
so the total spent for housing was $1.5 trillion, ten times the "rental
income" figure of the BEA. That the $150 in BEA rental-income accounts
have little connection with actual geo-rent becomes even clearer when
compared to the 2003 home mortgage debt of $7.2 trillion (Financial
Services Fact Book, 2005), total mortgages of $9.3 trillion in 2003
(Financial Services Fact Book, 2005), and a housing stock of $15
trillion (National Association of Realtors, 2005).</small><br>
<br>
<small>Property taxes in the U.S. are about $300 billion per year
(Youngman
and Malme, 1993), with $228 billion going to local governments (Fisher,
1999). If a landlord collects $20,000 in annual rent and pays a
property tax of $9,000, the &#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; here (not
subtracting depreciation) is only $11,000, because the reported amount
deducts the landlord&#8217;s property-tax expense. Similarly, homeowner and
condominium association dues are deducted out in arriving at &#8220;rental
income of persons.&#8221; This category &#8220;rental income of persons,&#8221; then,
both includes elements other than geo-rent (notably, rental payments
for improvements such as buildings), and excludes much of the geo-rent
of the land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Moreover, as Gaffney (1970, 194) concludes, the untaxing of
buildings,
which is part of the geo-rent taxation proposal, will raise ground rent
by an amount about equal to the loss of building taxes. Narrowing the
property tax to geo-rent only, therefore, would increase the geo-rent
tax-base by about the same amount as the building tax-based removed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Studies of geo-rent have been conducted by Steven Cord, Mason
Gaffney,
Mike Miles, and others. Mason Gaffney (1970, 181) finds that site value
is generally at least half of real estate value, which would imply that
for the housing stock alone the site value would be about $7.5 trillion.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For private lands, much of the revenue from geo-rent is hidden
in
interest payments, corporate profits, and capital gains, implying that
it isn&#8217;t showing up in &#8220;rental income of persons.&#8221; For example, the way
that building-owners may treat &#8220;depreciation&#8221; is unrealistic and even
nonsensical. Suppose Bob buys a building for $275,000 (excluding the
land value) and rents it out for $40,000 per year. On the premise that
a building is used up in 27.5 years, the tax code allows him to deduct
$10,000 each year. And then he deducts his real expense (maintenance,
etc.) of, say, $5,000, so the column shows only $25,000 in rental
income. Suppose that after 27.5 years, Bob sells the building to Sam.
Now Sam starts deducting depreciation all over again. Capital
consumption is to a large degree a legal fiction.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One bids less for land that has
tax liabilities and on which profits are lower.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Untax the economy, and the economy would
produce greater output, which would be capitalized into higher
geo-rent. </span>Even
if the geo-rent today were accurately calculated, it would be far less
than the potential public revenue, because of capitalization effects of
the untaxing side of the scheme. As noted, the scheme would involve
geo-rent payments from government agencies. That, of course, will
brings a corresponding increase in government spending, so the matter
of geo-rent of government lands is not pertinent to the present issue.
However, it is worth noting that for government lands, the geo-rent is
utterly opaque (Foldvary, 1989), and that would have to change.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Using a variety of data, Steven Cord (1985, 1991) puts geo-rent
at
around 20 percent of GDP. Mike Miles (1990) comes up with a similar
figure using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The totals
include government lands, but these estimates do not include the
increase in geo-rent that would occur with the elimination of
market-hampering taxes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The amount of actual and potential site revenues warrants much
more
research, but these findings indicate that the tax base is substantial,
most likely in the range of 50 percent of all-level government tax
revenues. Interestingly, if both punitive taxes and transfer payments
were eliminated, the geo-rent would about equal government spending for
goods and services, in accord with the Henry George Theorem! At any
rate, any allegation that land rent is too small to be of policy
significance would have to be well argued. <a

Tax-free Society</a> - Outline of remarks for use at
Moscow Congress,
5/21/96&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
Rents are a taxable surplus. I estimate that this
taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the national income in
most nations with market economies, and more in resource-rich
nations. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> 2. The value of rent is
huge. Every economy produces a
large excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some
of it goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not
part of the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return
of capital. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The rest of the excess over wages is captured in the rent of
land. It is a true taxable surplus. The amount is already huge, and
will become huger yet when existing taxes are abated.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Rent will become huger yet when you
abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another. ...</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Many varieties of natural
resources generate rents.
City land is the greatest single source.</span> For example, one city,
Vancouver, contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a
province of 934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
However, many other resources
yield rents. </span>Some of them are
also huge in value, even though some are inconspicuous. Here are a
few varieties of them:

Mason Gaffney:<a href="../docs/Gaffney_CG-E.html"> California's
Governor-Elect</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For better or worse, California
has recalled its governor and
elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His choice of advisors, however,
tells us A.S. will repeat Pete
Wilson's performance from the early 1990s. Chief of Staff Patricia
Clarey is a good soldier from Wilson's old staff; Auditor Donna
Arduin is from Jeb Bush's Florida. The gurus who set the doctrinal
tone give the clearest hints: they are neo-classical economists of
deepest dye. These are advisors George Shultz and Michael Boskin
from the Hoover Institution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economics,
to them, is a set of dismal
choices. California's choice is to cut public services, or lose
business and jobs. That is what they told Wilson in 1994. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">All taxes
are the same, always "burdens," always driving away "business."</span></span>&nbsp;
...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Boskin and Shultz, posing their
dismal choice for California,
dismissed by silence that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
can raise needed revenues while also
spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings. </span><strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is also alleged that land
values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turnover of costlier homes is
lower than that of ordinary homes. (For example, turnover of existing
homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2million = $1.5 trillions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are not large buildings:
they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone
is over $1m. They are not new buildings: only 9% are new. It's the
land that makes them worth so much.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax of 1% on that value would
yield $15 billions a year.</span> </b>
That's from only 2.7% of the urban homes in Calif. The data exclude
many sales, country manors, for example. Some well-known lands thus
excluded are </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the Lucas compound and the Pritzker family compound in
Marin; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>San Simeon; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Reagan Ranch and similar holdings in the
northern half of Sta. Barbara Cnty; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>fashionable winery properties in
choice valleys statewide; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the Chandler family's Tejon Ranch; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the
200,000 acres of James Boswell in the Tulare Lake Basin; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is also the other 97.3%
of urban owner-occupied
residential real estate.</b> A lot of it is just under $1 million a
pop. In Marin County, the <span style="font-style: italic;">median </span>sales
price of owner-occupied
single-family homes was $700,000 when last seen, and rising. The
mean is always higher than the median. Some L.A. County cities with
median values just under $1 million include San Marino, Bel Air,
Westwood, Brentwood, La Canada, Calabasas, and others. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is also
all the other land: commercial, industrial, farm, forest, etc., which
is 60% of the assessed property value in California, and a much
higher fraction of the real value because it is so egregiously
underassessed. ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A high fraction of California real estate is absentee owned.
</b> The Sultan of Brunei, for example, owns several houses and sites
in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. California's official Legislative
Analyst, the highly respected William Hamm, estimated <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">in 1978 that
over fifty per cent of the value of taxable property in California
was absentee-owned.</span> <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Some half of any reduction in California property taxes leaks
to out-of-state owners. </b> Nor is this the only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">leakage</span>.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Yet no one has seized on this
obvious case to show that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">local property taxes, substituted
for
absentee rent payments, creates multiple increases in local income.</span>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><small>First, it must be satisfactory as a revenue producer, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>second it must be equitable and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>third its economic effects should not collide with the
public
interest. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For instance if full employment
and economic growth are regarded as
desirable, the question to be examined is what effects will this tax
have on achieving these objectives?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The shortcomings of property
taxes as
revenue producers have been obvious for a long time and are widely known</span>.
The main difficulty is that revenues from property taxation do not keep
pace with the ever-increasing requirements of local governments. Every
county, every city official and every school administrator will
testify, that there are not enough funds available to meet the
requirements of local governments.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The inability of local government to raise enough revenues from
property taxation has forced them to borrow at an ever-increasing rate.
The debts of local governments have increased from about $16 billions
in 1947 to over $61 billions in 1963, an increase of about 382%. During
the same period private debt increased by 279% and federal debt by only
26%. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into
wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city.&nbsp; <small><small><big><big><a

<br>
The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland):<a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"> Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Rent for the Community a
Design of Divine
Providence.</b>
</small><br>
<small>I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of
authority as well as of reason, that the people are and always must
be the real owners of the land of their country.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This great social fact appears to
me to be of incalculable
importance, and it is fortunate indeed that on the strictest
principles of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of
uncertainty or doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar
beauty in the clearness with which it reveals the wisdom and the
benevolence of the designs of Providence in the admirable provision
He has made for the wants and the necessities of that state of social
existence of which He is the author, and in which the very instincts
of nature tell us we are to spend our lives.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A vast public property, a great
national fund, has been placed
under the dominion and at the disposal of the nation to supply itself
abundantly with resources necessary to liquidate the expenses of its
government, the administration of its laws and the education of its
youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable sustentation and
support of its criminal and pauper population. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">One of the most
interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is never
stationary; It is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct
ratio to the growth of the population; and the very causes that
increase and multiply the demands made on it increase proportionately
its ability to meet them.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlordism Takes the
Patrimony of the People.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Let the democracy of England as well as of Ireland, learn the
melancholy fate that has overtaken this splendid inheritance which
God has placed in their hands, and which would have saved them eighty
millions sterling which they now annually pay by direct and indirect
taxation for the government of the country. That patrimony was once
theirs by right, and by right it is theirs still; but, in fact, it is
theirs no longer: a class has wrested the land from the people of the
country and now hold a strict monopoly in it. They sell it out to the
people as if it were an ordinary article of private property and
solely the result of their own capital and labour.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rents which the landlords draw
from their lands is an income
which they derive from the sale of what are avowedly God's gifts,
which "no man made." If they had only claimed the right of selling
the use of the permanent improvements they had made in the soil, by
the capital and labour they had expended on it, no one could dispute
the Justice of their demand; but any element of income that might
possibly be derived from this source is called in the language of
political economy, not Rent, but Profit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Political economists who have
written with scientific precision on
the nature and properties of Rent, confine it exclusively to the
moneys which the landlord receives for allowing the tenant the use of
the original and natural productiveness of the soil. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Values intended by
Providence for Public Purposes.</b></small><br>
<small>I have already observed that the chief peculiarity of the land
of
a country was that its value was never stationary, that it was always
progressive and rising, that in fact it increased in a direct ratio
with the growth of the population and the advancing progress of the
industry of the nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would seem as if Providence had
destined the land to serve as a
large economical reservoir, to catch, to collect and preserve the
overflowing streams of wealth that are constantly escaping from the
great public industrial works that are always going on in communities
that are progressive and prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the permanent improvements
that are made in the land
itself, and which increase its productiveness and value, there are
other industrial works not carried out on the land itself, but on its
surroundings and in its vicinity, and which enhance its value very
considerably. A new road is made for the accommodation of a district;
a new bridge is thrown across a river or a stream to make two
important localities accessible to each other; a new railway passes
close by and connects it with certain large and important centres of
industry; a new factory or a new mill is erected, or a new town is
built in the neighbourhood.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Industrial works like these add
very materially to the value of
all the land in their vicinity. It is a well-known fact that a new
railway has in several instances doubled the value of the land
through which it passed, in consequence of the increased facilities
it had afforded for the sale of its agricultural products.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In every state of society, which
is progressive and improving,
such industrial works are continually going on, and hence the value
of the land is rising also everywhere. But its value rises enormously
with the enlarged growth of the population of a nation, and with the
increased productiveness of its industry.<a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In assessing the value of a tax
it is also important, of course,
to understand its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of
government. This is usually deemed revenue sufficiency. Income, sales
and property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent,
have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. In contrast, if you take the time to
look at a tax on land value alone, it measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!...<a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"> <span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>In the Georgist
view, this economic rent is the public&#8217;s birthright,</big><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">47</span></small> and
the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises approximately a third of the economy as it is currently
calculated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Arrangements such as these are to the followers of Henry
George a far more efficient and moral system of public finance. ... <a
