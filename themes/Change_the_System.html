Robert G. Ingersoll: <a
 href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay
Sermon</a> (1886)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
any land that he does not use.
Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
it. And why? Don't you know that if people could bottle the air, they
would? Don't you know that there would be an American Air-bottling
Association? And don't you know that they would allow thousands and
millions to die for want of breath, if they could not pay for air? I am
not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a
few landlords and millions of tenants. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, suppose that every man were to have all the land he is able
to
buy. The Vanderbilts could buy today all the land that is in farms in
the State of Ohio -- every foot of it. Would it be for the best
interest of that State to have a few landlords and four or five
millions of serfs? ... Understand, I am not blaming these people. There
is a good deal of
human nature in us all. You remember the story of the man who made a
speech at a Socialist meeting, and closed it by saying, "Thank God, I
am no monopolist," but as he sank to his seat said, "But I wish to the
Lord I was!" We must remember that these rich men are naturally
produced. Do not blame them. Blame the system! ...<a

Winston Churchill: <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">The Mother
of All Monopolies</a><br>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>All goes back
to the land, and the
landowner, who, in many cases,
in most cases, is a worthy person utterly unconscious of the
character of the methods by which he is enriched, is enabled with
resistless strength to absorb to himself a share of almost every
public and every private benefit however important or however pitiful
those benefits may be.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">I hope you will understand that,
when I speak of the land
monopolist, I am dealing more with the process than with the
individual landowner. I have no wish to hold any class up to public
disapprobation. I do not think that the man who makes money by
unearned increment in land is morally a worse man than anyone else
who gathers his profit where he finds it in this hard world under the
law and according to common usage. It is not the individual I attack,
it is the system. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not
the man
who is bad, it is the law which
is bad.</span> It is not the man who is blameworthy for doing what the
law
allows and what other men do, it is the State which would be
blameworthy were it not to endeavour to reform the law and correct
the practice. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We do not want to
punish the landlord. We want to alter
the law.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take the case to which I have
already referred, of the man who
keeps a large plot in or near a growing town idle for years, while it
is "ripening" - that is to say, while it is rising in price through
the exertions of the surrounding community and the need of that
community for more room to live. Take that case. I daresay you have
formed your own opinion upon it. Mr. Balfour, Lord Lansdowne, and the
Conservative Party generally, think that that is an admirable
arrangement. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They speak of the
profits of the land monopolist, as if
they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing example
for the poorer classes to imitate.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We
do not take that view of the
process. We think it is a
dog-in-the-manger game. </span>We see the evil, we see the imposture
upon
the public, and we see the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered
commerce, in distorted or restricted development, and in congested
centres of population, and we say here and now to the land monopolist
who is holding up his land -- and the pity is it was not said before --
you shall judge for yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not-we
say to the land monopolist -- "This property of yours might be put to
immediate use with general advantage. It is at this minute saleable
in the market at 10 times the value at which it is rated. If you
choose to keep it idle in the expectation of still further unearned
increment then at least you shall be taxed at the true selling value
in the meanwhile." ...&nbsp; </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"You who shall liberate the
land," said Mr. Cobden, "will do more
for your country than we have done in the the liberation of its
commerce."&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
