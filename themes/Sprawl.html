Henry George:&nbsp;<a
 href="../HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html">Why The Landowner
Cannot Shift The Tax on Land Values</a> (1887)<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"><br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A VERY common objection to the
proposition to concentrate all taxes on Land Values is that the
landowner would add the increased tax on the value of his land to the
rent that must be paid by his tenants. It is this notion that increased
Taxation of Land Values would fall upon the users, not upon the owners
of land, that more perhaps than anything else prevents men from seeing
the far-reaching and beneficent effects of doing away with the taxes
that now fall upon labor or the products of labor, and taking for
public use those values that attach to land by reason of the growth and
progress of society. </small><br>
<br>
<small>That taxes levied upon Land Values, or, to use the
politico-economic term, taxes levied upon rent, do not fall upon the
user of land, and cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant
is conceded by all economists of reputation. However much they may
dispute as to other things, there is no dispute upon this point.
Whatever flimsy reasons any of them may have deemed it expedient to
give why the tax on rent should not be more resorted to, they all admit
that the taxation of rent merely diminishes the profits of the
landowner, cannot be shifted on the user of land, cannot add to prices,
nor check production. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
But while the Taxation of Land Values cannot raise rents, it
would, especially in a country like this, where there is so much
valuable land unused, tend strongly to lower them.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In all our cities,
and through all the country, there is much land which is not used, or
not put to its best use, because it is held at high prices by men who
do not want to, or who cannot, use it themselves, but who are holding
it in expectation of profiting by the increased value which the
growth of population will give to it in the future.</span> Now the
effect of
the Taxation of Land Values would be to compel these men to seek
tenants or purchasers. Land upon which there is no taxation even a
poor man can easily hold for higher prices, for land eats nothing.
But put heavy taxation upon it, and even a rich man will be driven to
seek purchasers or tenants, and to get them he will have to put down
the price he asks, instead of putting it up; for it is by asking
less, not by asking more, that those who have anything they are
forced to dispose of must seek customers. Rather than continue to pay
heavy taxes upon land yielding him nothing, and from the future
increase in value of which he could have no expectation of profit,
since increase in value would mean increased taxes, he would be glad
to give it away or let it revert to the State. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the dogs in the
manger, who all over the country are withholding land that they
cannot use themselves from men who would be glad to use it, would be
forced to let go their grasp. To tax Land Values up to anything like
their full amount would be to utterly destroy speculative values, and
to diminish all rents into which this speculative element enters. </span>And
how groundless it is to think that landlords who have tenants could
shift a tax on Land Values upon their tenants can be readily seen
from the effect upon landlords who have no tenants. It is when
tenants seek for land, not when landlords seek for tenants, that rent
goes up. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> To put the matter in a form in
which it can be easily
understood, let us take two cases. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The one, a country where the
available land is all in use, and the competition of tenants has
carried rents to a point at which the tenant pays the landlord all he
can possibly earn save just enough to barely live. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The other, a
country where all the available land is not in use and the rent that
the landlord can get from the tenant is limited by the terms on which
the tenant can get access to unused land. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How, in either case, if the
tax were imposed upon Land Values (or rent), could the landlord
compel the tenant to pay it? </small><br>
<br>
<small> It may be well to call attention to the fact that a tax on Land
Values is not a tax on land. They are very different things, and the
difference should be noted, because a confusion of thought as to them
may lead to the assumption that a tax on Land Values would fall on
the user. Barring such effect as it might have on speculation, a tax
on land &#8212; that is to say, a tax of so much per acre or so much per
foot on all land &#8212; would fall on the user. For such a tax,
falling equally on all land &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;">on the
poorest and least
advantageously situated as fully as on the richest and best situated
land</span> &#8212; would become a condition imposed on the use of any land,
from which there could be no escape, and thus the owners of rentable
land could add it to their rent. Its operation would be analogous to
that of a tax on a producible commodity, and it would in effect
reduce the supply of land sufficient to pay the tax. But a tax on
economic rent or Land Values would not fall on all land. It would
fall only on valuable land, and on that in proportion to its value.
It would not have to be paid upon the poorest land in use (which
always determines rent), and so would not become a condition of use,
or restrict the amount of land that could be profitably used. Thus
the landowners on whom it fell could not shift it on the users of
land.&nbsp; ...<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">

of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
You may see the same thing all over this country. See how injuriously
in the agricultural districts this thing of private property in land
afflects the roads and the distances between the people. A man does not
take what land he wants, what he can use, but he takes all he can get,
and the consequence is that his next neighbour has to go further along,
people are separated from each other further than they ought to be, to
the increased difficulty of production, to the loss of neighbourhood
and companionship. They have more roads to maintain than they can
decently maintain; they must do more work to get the same result, and
life is in every way harder and drearier. ... <a

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty,
  Chapter 4: Land Speculation Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
      shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of the
      margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent, must,
      like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances through
      half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches
      the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead entry or pre-emption.
      He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is forced so much farther than
      he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation which is holding these unused
      lands in expectation of increased value in the future. And when he settles,
      he will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can use, in the
      belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow him are again
      forced farther on than the necessities of production require, carrying the
      margin of cultivation to still less productive, because still more remote points.</p>
  <p> If the land of superior quality as to location were always fully used before
      land of inferior quality were resorted to, no vacant lots would be left as
      a city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties in the midst of costly
      buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable, are withheld from use,
      or from the full use to which they might be put, because their owners, not
      being able or not wishing to improve them, prefer, in expectation of the advance
      of land values, to hold them for a higher rate than could now be obtained from
      those willing to improve them. And, in consequence of this land being withheld
      from use, or from the full use of which it is capable, the margin of the city
      is pushed away so much farther from the center.</p>
  <p>But when we reach the limits of the growing city the actual margin of building,
      which corresponds to the margin of cultivation in agriculture &#8212;      we
      shall not find the land purchasable at its value for agricultural purposes,
      as
    it would
      be were rent determined simply by present requirements; but we shall find
    that for a long distance beyond the city, land bears a speculative value,
    based
      upon the belief that it will be required in the future for urban purposes,
      and that to reach the point at which land can be purchased at a price not
    based upon urban rent, we must go very far beyond the actual margin of urban
    use. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>A New Tax Ethic </strong>Beyond the greater conformity to sound
    tax principles as noted earlier, the taxation of economic rent that accretes
    as a surplus upon land can offer
    two additional advantages. The first of these is the removal of the distortions
    wrought upon urban land use configurations and the negative environmental
    impacts which are presently apparent. The greatest of these effects is in
    the form of suburban sprawl, a phenomenon viewed with increasing alarm not
    only by its degradation of life quality but in the increased expenditures
    of time and resources (especially energy). Land use patterns, as intractable
    as they tend to be, will have to modify simply on account of the evolving
    limitations of future life. There are likely to be changes also in the way
    by which air, water, and other public goods are exploited. Treatment of these
    resources as &quot;free goods&quot; or as captive property of private parties
    will end if it is realized how generous the rental flow to public treasuries
    can be.... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much of the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">environmental
damage</span> we have witnessed in the 20th century can be laid
directly at the doorstep of faulty government policy, particularly
fiscal policy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suburban
sprawl</span>, to take the instance of greatest
concern to us all now, results from two misapplications of fiscal
policy applied under police powers. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The first is the pricing motor
vehicle transportation service at only about a tenth of what it really
costs to drive. </small><br>
<small> </small><br>
<small>The second is the design of our conventional property
tax which encourages the destructive practice of land speculation and
the centrifugal forces of sprawl. </small><br>
<small> </small><br>
<small>The argument needs to be developed in
two parts. Pricing transportation services properly are equally as
important as location pricing, as the two are, to a large extent,
reciprocals. In this report only the matter of property taxation is
addressed. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>When one looks at the value of land in any broad way, its value
will be
highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the spring of 1998, one land parcel
(the building was to be razed)
of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's Times
Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
million,</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">19</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
more than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands
north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. </span>The
highest
value land is
typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
passed through. In this sense,
land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
egregious patterns of sprawl.&nbsp; ... <a

<p>    Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
    Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The failure to collect site
rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
<small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel.</small><br>
<br>
<small>From the standpoint of an economic geographer, and for some land
economists, land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land
rent is the surplus generated by social activity on or in the vicinity
of locational sites which accrues to titleholders of those parcels.
Whether or not it is recaptured by public policy, rent is a natural
factor deriving from the intensive use of natural capital. More
intensive use of high value landsites leads to site configurations that
are less dependent upon transportation services. People can access them
easily even by walking. One must remember that transportation is not an
end in itself but rather a means. This is something often forgotten
even by urban planners, the distinction between accessibility and
mobility.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Public opinion polls are practically unanimous in their
demonstration
of the kind of environment most Americans say they would like to live
in.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(16)</span></small>
Sociological studies have documented graphically how alienating the
car-dependent environment really is. There is an inverse correlation
between the ability of a street to move and to park cars and trucks,
and the amount of social interaction between neighbors on that street.
One study two decades ago compared three similar residential streets in
San Francisco, with different levels of traffic volumes. Residents on
the different streets were asked to indicate on the base maps of their
streets where friends and acquaintances lived. Those living on streets
with the least traffic volume had three times as many friends and twice
as many acquaintances as those living on the streets with heavy traffic
volumes<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(17)</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(18)</span></small>
More recently Harvard Professor Robert Putnam has made similar findings
in his book Bowling Alone, and concluded that every ten minutes of
additional commuting time means ten percent less time devoted to
communal activity. Driving is no longer regarded as fun, not on today's
typically congested highways. There was a time when most people drove
cars for pleasure; today people resent their having to drive so much
and often see driving as a burden.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(19)</span></small> It
is also no accident also that on measures of livability, those
locations regarded as most attractive are also the ones that are most
bicycle-friendly.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(20)</span></small> A
number of recent books and their popularity reflect resentment over our
forced dependency on motor vehicle transportation Jane Holtz Kay's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Asphalt Nation</span>, Clay McShane's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Down the Asphalt Path</span>, Wolfgang
Zuckerman's <span style="font-style: italic;">End of the Road</span>,
and Katie Alford's <span style="font-style: italic;">Divorce Your Car</span>
are only a few such examples.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(21)</span></small> But
despite their vague discomfort people typically lack the perspicacity
to incorporate these non-pecuniary costs into their decisions about
locational choice.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by
Pricing:
Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
(but higher travel cost) locales. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The conventional property tax, one taxing both land values and
improvement values, is analogous to a train with an engine at each end.
The tax on land value fosters improvement on the parcels with the
highest market and social value, while the tax on structures
discourages that very same thing. No wonder it is that economic
activities is stymied most in the urban centers and manifests itself in
areas where the least imposition of all has taken hold. As scholar
Jessica Matthews once put it,</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>In a now familiar
sequence, developers
reach for the cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is
left to fill in behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage
systems and schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and
schools are left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that
marches steadily outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside
the moving edge. Because residential development can't meet the public
bills, local governments compete for commercial investment with tax
discounts that deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes
then rise, providing an incentive for new development. Years of such
leap-frogging construction devours land at an astonishing pace.<span

Way&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>It constituted no disincentive
to business location or population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a

are, they are among its most esteemed members. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To some people this may be
counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Jessica Matthews, now with the
Council on Foreign Relations,
recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a now familiar
sequence, developers reach for the
cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in
behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage systems and
schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are
left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily
outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because residential development
can't meet the public bills, local
governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
providing an incentive for new development.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Years of such leap-frogging
construction devours land at an
astonishing pace. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Now if the full
social opportunity cost of land
occupancy were charged to landholders, the reward of (and incentive
for) speculation would be obliterated, and land now locked up by
speculators would be transferred to users.</span> Users would employ
more
labor and engender more capital development instead of seeing it
locked up in wasted space.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Absent adequate taxation the
regions at the periphery are the
first developed, just as Ms. Matthews observes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economics profession is only
now coming to recognize its
responsibility for what it has wrought. Economists are coming to
recognize the costs of sprawl, and studies show how astonishingly
inefficient the suburban lifestyle is. One review of the literature
on the subject of comparative development costs published by the
Urban Land Institute revealed that "houses built in sprawling
developments may cost 40 to 400 percent more to serve than if they
were located close to major facilities, were clustered in contiguous
areas, and incorporated a variety of housing types."... <a

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The depletion of natural
resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics" ...
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">II. The problem of sprawl</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While taxes on labour
and
capital act as a deterrent to production and employment, the unique
qualities of land are such that a tax on land values encourages land to
be put to its optimal use. Simply put, land holders cannot afford to
hold land unused or underused, for they are compelled to pay the full
LVT whether they use this scarce resource or not. </span>The resulting
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compact cityscape</span>
would consume far less resources (in terms of land, infrastructure and
ongoing energy costs) and would be more amenable to the provision of
public transport, walking and riding.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Note that advocates of LVT, often nowadays called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Geoists</span>,
call for the full collection of the LVT and not the partial and
misapplied (with all manner of exemptions and thresholds) forms
collected by some local, state and federal governments in Australia and
elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When the land occupier is
repaying his/her full dues (which is only just, as they represent the
value of the amenities of the land), then land will have no market
price. </span>The improvements on the land (buildings etc.) retain
their market value as they are not being taxed, so production is not
penalised or discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The social
justice implications of having land with no market price (i.e. all
humanity having their very birthright) are profound, but are again
outside the domain of this paper. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While, at first sight, the prospect of
sprawling cities with lots of open space and possible greenery might be
appealing from an environmental perspective, a closer examination
should lead to a different conclusion.</span> The inducement to collect
windfall profits (resulting from the failure of society to apply LVT)
encourages some landholders to withhold vacant land from the market and
forces new development to "leapfrog" this land and move further out.
Hence there is an unnecessary outlay in roads, pipelines, power
supplies and other infrastructure which must service a greater area.
Commuting journeys, similarly, must now consume greater resources.
Financially inducing land to be put to its optimal use is not
"flogging" the land, but is rather ensuring land is carefully used and
that we only exploit as much as we properly need.&nbsp; <span

GEO-RENT&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>While this

  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Geo-rent taxation would reduce sprawl</span>.
    </span>Current
tax policies tend to discourage the development of urban land, because
the fruits of those developments are directly taxed. To the extent that
those policies are replaced by policies that tap geo-rent, the
landowner is incented to develop his land. Recall, an underused site
pays the same geo-rent tax as a developed site. The untaxing of
production combined with the tapping of geo-rent will induce infilling
of the city center, making for a more compact city, agreeable to mixed
use and pedestrian activity. Hence, the demand-side push for sprawl is
diminished. Moreover, the supply-side pull toward sprawl would also be
diminished: Today, sprawl landowners are subsidized by extraneous
taxpayers who pay for the roads, sewers, schools, fire-fighting, and
security in the sprawl neighborhoods. If those services depended on the
community&#8217;s geo-rent, the pull toward sprawl would be reduced. <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
CASE OF URBAN SETTLEMENT </span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The central problem
here is
urban sprawl; the
solution is compactness.</span>&nbsp; More land urbanized means more
urban
runoff.&nbsp; But more people on given land may even mean less runoff
per acre, e.g. at the threshold where sewering can economically replace
a collection of septic tanks and leach lines.&nbsp; It certainly means
less runoff per capita.&nbsp; It means better control of any given
runoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>A compact, synergistic city is resource-saving;
sprawl is resource-wasting, using up more land, capital, materials,
fuels, and air/water quality to substitute for direct human contacts
and cooperation.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Here are some
items that sprawl maximizes or
worsens: </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the number of car-miles for any given level of
urban linkage, with smog generated in proportion.&nbsp; (The
unforgettable demonstration of the last came in 1967 when Mayor Henry
Maier closed all Milwaukee gas stations for a week, because of arson
and riot threats.&nbsp; As a by-product Milwaukeeans saw, for the first
and last times, what clean air really looks like &#8212; glorious!) &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>paved areas, with salt and roadside litter both
spread in proportion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>"and sudden death."&nbsp; Auto accidents, the
ultimate "negative externality," kill some 40,000 Americans per year,
maim many times more, and intimidate everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>grading and denuding new lands, generally
upstream and more sloping.&nbsp; Three-quarters of the pollutant
loadings in the Menominee River come from urban non-point
sources.&nbsp; Developing urban areas cover only 2.6% of the watershed,
but contribute 37% of the suspended solids and 48% of the
phosphorous.&nbsp; (Bauman et al. 1980, cited in Falk, 1985, p.
P-II-B-2) </small></li>
  <li><small>number of homes on septic tanks. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>diversion of sewer funds from treating sewage to
collecting it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>larger lots and lawns, longer driveways. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>inhabited areas without good fire protection,
with more grass and brush exposed to humans. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>private wells puncturing aquifer caps. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>settlement and industry beyond gutters and storm
drains. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>withering of mass transit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>longer, wider utility rights&#8209;of&#8209;way, with higher
voltage and pressure and hazard. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>filling wetlands </small></li>
  <li><small>occupying floodplains, so more flood control
reservoirs are needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>automobile dependency creates its own treadmill
effect.&nbsp; The car itself is the major consumer of urban space,
space which must in turn be traversed, using still more
car&#8209;miles.&nbsp; Pedestrians and cyclers are maimed and intimidated
into becoming motorists.&nbsp; Mass transit withers away.&nbsp; The
market does not lead us to optimal outcomes in such a world &#8212; this
world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suburbs
abate their own problems by
pick&#8209;pocketing
central cities, e.g. by getting sewers they could not pay for
themselves.</span>&nbsp; Milwaukee Metropolitan is as good an example
as
any.&nbsp; Systemwide that is a dubious gain, when the central
infrastructure goes to ruins.&nbsp; The titles of some seminal works on
this subject tell the story quite well: America in Ruins (Choate and
Walters, 1981); The Costs of Sprawl (Downs); "Cost&#8209;push of Urban
Sprawl" (Schechter); "The City as a Distorted Price System"
(Thompson).&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Solutions
to urban sprawl will involve at least
these three courses:</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">a)
Marginal-cost pricing of city
services, with a spatial or locational component.</span>&nbsp; Example:
a
water&#8209;rate surcharge rising with pressure zones.&nbsp; Cheap city
services in the center, encouraging infill and centralization.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">b) Renewal&#8209;oriented tax policy,
especially in central cities.&nbsp;</span> (Milwaukee needs this the
worst
way, having lost population and capital for many years now.)&nbsp;
Renewal-oriented property taxation means to impose higher tax rates on
land than buildings (Breckenfeld).&nbsp; Former Mayor Dan Hoan favored
this policy (Hoan, pp. 26-27), and what Hoan favored, Hoan did.&nbsp;<br>
Renewal-oriented property assessment accomplishes
the same end by apportioning a higher share of assessed value to land,
and less to buildings.&nbsp; During Hoan's tenure the City Assessor
accomplished it by using the "building-residual" method of
apportionment.&nbsp; He drew up, reproduced, and publicly distributed
land value maps, on which every parcel was valued at its highest and
best use, as determined by comparable sales in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
This approach approximately triples the assessed value of land, as
compared to current Milwaukee practise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c) Renewal-oriented spending and
service policy</span>.&nbsp; One guide to this is "tiered" zoning and
planning, firm and consistent.&nbsp; Attorney Robert Freilich, the
"father of growth control," has shown how to make this work in Ramapo,
San Diego, and we hope soon in Riverside.&nbsp; When Dan Hoan was Mayor
of Milwaukee, 1916-36, he oriented spending this way reflexively (Hoan,
Chaps. 2,8), to serve the existing city rather than to expand it.&nbsp;
Milwaukee was a city that worked &#8212; then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>One may prefer other measures.&nbsp; More should be
said about constraining the space demands of cars and trucks.&nbsp; But
the point is that whatever measures one wants, they will have to cut
much deeper than taxing pesticides and fertilizers.&nbsp; We are
talking about major, radical readjustments of urban, tax and utility
policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> </small><a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A city that grows in capital and
people generally enjoys a long stage
of increasing returns to the composite urban economy, even though each
atomistic site is improved in the stage of decreasing returns to
capital and people.&nbsp; This antinomy is due to synergy.&nbsp; Cities
exist to bring people and capital together in space.&nbsp; People
attract more people; capital attracts more capital; people and capital
attract each other.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Adding land to a city, on the other hand, often results in
diminishing
and even negative returns to the composite city.&nbsp; Cities are
already full of holes.&nbsp; Adding more land, especially in the
sprawled manner of modern American cities, adds to the cost of tying
the pieces together.&nbsp; There is an enormous literature on the
wastes of sprawl.&nbsp; It may be summarized in two points.&nbsp;
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it foils the very purpose of cities, by keeping
people and
capital apart, and aborting synergies among them.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, it
raises the cost of preserving such synergies as survive.<strong> ...&nbsp; </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
In finding the optimal resultant of these
opposing forces we are
faced with more than a standard example of diminishing returns.&nbsp;
One
could perceive land division as simply a matter of applying more people
and capital to a given area of land.&nbsp; The more intensive
application
to each acre justifies itself up to a point by added yields from each
acre; beyond that the added yields do not compensate for the added
costs.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But there is more here than a simple matter of quantities and
proportions
of inputs.&nbsp; There is also a distance factor.&nbsp; The more
parcels
we add the closer are their nuclei, and the less is the cost of linking
them along the common lines.&nbsp; The cost per acre is, to be sure,
higher: that is inherent in adding more labor and capital to a given
amount of land.&nbsp; But the linkage cost per parcel drops as we add
nuclei by dividing land into more parcels.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is an asymmetry here that has been obscured in the
evolution of
marginal productivity theory, with its effort to show that the
relationships among all the classical factors of production are
"symmetrical," so that diminishing returns is simply variable
proportions.&nbsp; Land is not symmetrical with labor/capital.&nbsp;
When you add nuclei of labor/capital to land, they get packed closer
together.&nbsp; But when you add land to fixed labor and capital, the
units all get farther apart -- the land units as well as the nuclei of
labor/capital.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Such distancing of the active nuclei of economic life requires
more
capital and land devoted to the linkages among them - "urban sprawl" is
the familiar term.&nbsp; Sclerosis is the corresponding medical
condition: an overgrowth and hardening of connective tissues at the
expense of the active tissues they link.&nbsp; It is pathological for
societies, as it is for organisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Las Vegas, not a typical city, is the
largest I know of that indeed
grows in worthless desert.&nbsp; Here another factor stands out
clearly:
new lands are peripheral and only imperfect, partial substitutes for
central land.&nbsp; The city must range farther for water, power, waste
disposal, raw materials and markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The high marginal cost of adding to spreading cities, and the
low true
net value of the additions, are concealed, in our culture, by an
elaborate and pervasive system of subsidies and cross-subsidies built
into our institutions and political power structures.&nbsp; These drain
the old centers to feed the fringes.&nbsp; In a systemwide accounting
we
find the true social cost of urban sprawl as we know it today to exceed
the gains at the margins.&nbsp; We are not so much adding land to
cities
as wasting capital, dissipating central rents to do it.&nbsp; Thus the
private rent gradient and resulting land-value gradient that we observe
in the marketplace is much flatter than the true gradient that is
hidden
under the subsidies.&nbsp; Even so, the visible gradient remains
impressive: values rise to $2,000/psf in San Francisco, Chicago and
Manhattan, and $25,000/psf in Tokyo.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land of rare and limited qualities is often the basis of market
control:
retail sites, rights-of-way, rare ores, water rights, are familiar
examples.&nbsp; Even land of less rare qualities is often used for
market
control.&nbsp; American farm output is controlled by means of acreage
limitations; Texas and now&nbsp;OPEC oil production by oil well
protates; and so
on. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole article</a></small>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Underuse of better lands forces
labor and capital (which is mobile,
like labor) to resort to worse or &#8220;marginal&#8221; lands, thus
scattering and spreading out settlement, raising aggregate demands on
land, and wasting capital (George, 1879). This lowering of the
&#8220;margin of production&#8221; lowers the marginal productivity of
labor and capital, and hence their economic rewards, tilting the
distribution of income in favor of landowners, creating an illusion
of overpopulation (Malthus), and lack of investment outlets (Marx,
Keynes, Hobson et al.). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That pattern was first recognized
in farming, but it is universal.
The underuse of central city lands (large parts of which are
derelict) drives demand outwards to less accessible urban sites. From
there, the same force drives demand outwards to the inner suburbs;
from there, to further suburbs, and so on. &#8220;Urban sprawl&#8221;
is the generic name, but &#8220;scatter&#8221; and
&#8220;disintegration&#8221; express the point better. Farm and
wilderness defenders perceive the problem mainly at the edge of
cities, noting the loss of open land, but that is a lesser social and
economic loss than the destruction of urban values inside the edge.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One way of denying the basic
problem is to call it
&#8220;unbalanced growth,&#8221; as in Orange County, where people
recognize it as too many jobs relative to the housing supply. It is
not the &#8220;unbalance&#8221; that is the problem, though: how can
there be too many jobs? It is too little housing that is the problem,
driving demand eastwards up through Sta. Ana Canyon, with its awful
traffic bottleneck, to central Riverside County, where it meets
demand fleeing north from San Diego. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now weave this pattern of

U.S. motorists is not joy-riding, but the forced consumption of
commutation, forced by scattered urban sprawl, the product of land
speculation.</span> Auto-apologists get this backwards, of course,
making
joy-riding the cause and sprawl the effect. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In forestry, the places to grow
commercial timber are lands that
are &#8220;flat, wet, and warm,&#8221; as John Baden summarizes it. (He
might have added, &#8220;accessible.&#8221;) Failure to restock such
lands economically pushes demand onto lands that are steep, dry and
cold, creating the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">forestry sprawl</span>&#8221;
from which we suffer.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Failure to put indigenous waters
of southern California to full
economical use creates the appearance of scarcity where there is
actually enough water. It drives demand northwards to the Owens
Valley and the Feather River, and eastward to the Colorado River, at
enormous social cost, much of it for energy. Those who issue doomsday
dessication scenarios, and deplore the loss of water to farming, also
seem to have no idea of how a handful of giant landowners waste most
of our water on low-valued uses like pasture, hay, small grains and
rice, using primitive wasteful methods like flooding, or furrow
irrigation. Only 2-3% of our irrigated lands use basic conservation
techniques like drip emitters. Those who waste water in this way are
basically substituting water, a limited natural resource, for the
labor and capital others use to conserve water while growing
higher-valued crops (Gaffney, 1997; Kahrl). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One could go on through a long
list of natural resources, but once
one gets the idea, those with understanding and imagination can fill
in hundreds of details. </small></p>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lemma: the same phenomenon
forces mobile factors to invade
wilderness areas, wetlands, etc., when their demands go unmet on the
lands more suitable for human use. Writing in 1879, George did not
stress this point, but the relationship should be obvious to us today.
... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Cities, if compact and with good circulation, are
resource-conserving (Gaffney, 1978, 1980). Free land markets, absent
institutional biases and land speculation, would work to make cities
compact. Land speculation is the worm in the apple of land markets,
however, resulting in urban sprawl. Taxing land on the basis of its
market value overcomes such speculation and lets the market make
cities compact (Gaffney, 2001). <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<small>IV. The need for user charges&nbsp; <b><br>
</b></small>
<p><small>Likewise, there are at least two kinds of containment
policies for
urban sprawl.</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>One says <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop! Thou
shalt not </span>settle
outside the designated growth boundary, neither shalt thou build, nor
manufacture, nor trade, nor store goods, nor park vehicles, nor disport
thyself in other than traditional country-squire-like amusements. I
shall call this a "negative containment policy."</small></li>
  <li><small>The other policy says Go!, or rather <b>Come! Come into
my city
and rebuild it</b>. This is not "development" in the modern pejorative
sense of territorial expansion. Rather it is REdevelopment in the
manner of the phoenix - the mythical bird, that is, not the city
misnamed Phoenix, which is an awful example of mindless lateral
expansion without renewal.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small><b>Consider Philadelphia, once the City of Brotherly Love
founded
by an idealistic English Quaker. Today, after 3 centuries of
development, Philadelphia has 15,800 vacant lots, but that only
begins the story. It has 27,000 empty houses (i.e. junkers on usable
lots that might as well be vacant); 1500 acres of vacant land and
brownfields; and 700 vacant commercial bldgs.</b> A local journalist
names it BlightTown, U.S.A. If he travelled a bit he'd find it is
only one of many.</small></p>
<p><small>The result of decay without renewal is to threaten the
countryside; settlers spill out, "like ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing." Yet, these are not ghosts, nor autumn leaves in the west
wind; these are live people. Destroy man's habitat here and he moves
it there, and takes habitat from other life forms. The solutions to
urban decay and disintegration are infilling and renewal. Here is
where the Green Light Tax is such a good management tool. It lets
cities rebuild themselves without tax penalties on new building, and
rise like the phoenix from their own ashes.</small></p>
<p><small>There is a reflex against growth and development we must
learn to
overcome. "Growth" should not be an issue to divide us: it depends on
the kind of growth. Resentment of growth and development stems in
large part from associating them with territorial expansion.
Infilling and renewal and rehab, however, UNCOUPLE growth from
sprawl: they let cities grow (or at least stop shrinking) without
sprawling. Ascending to a satellite view, let's look at the whole
system of settlement: focusing people where they should be keeps them
away from where they shouldn't be.</small></p>
<p><small>Here is an aerial view of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a state
dominated by owners of million-acre ranches, and therefore with about
the lowest property tax rate in the U.S. Albuquerque sprawls out
about 30 miles east-west, and another 30 miles north-south, giving a
density of about 300-400 people per square mile for its 330,000
residents. Many of its homes are slums.</small></p>
<p><small>Contrast that with the aerial view of Sydney, Australia, a
city
that raises a lot of its budget from "Green Light" taxes on site
value. Sydney and suburbs have nearly 3 million people, on less land
than Albuquerque, and with no slums.</small></p>
<p><small><b>There is plenty of land to go around.</b> The pleasant
green
villages of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin are upper-income
Milwaukee suburbs that feature detached homes on tree-lined streets,
with detached garages, laws against overnight curb parking, a number
of lakeshore mansions with parklike grounds, ample public parks, good
shopping, and a little industry. Their densities are 10,000 persons
per square mile. At this density, 250 million Americans would fit
nicely into less than half of Wisconsin, an average-sized one of 50
states. (They would occupy 0.7% of the United States.)</small></p>
<p><small>At the 10,000 density, Greater Milwaukee would fit inside
Milwaukee County, yet it now sprawls out over several counties. It
sprawls farther yet if one counts the rural residents who float in
and out of town for seasonal work. Shorewood and Whitefish Bay have
high density because they are the only Milwaukee suburbs with no
vacant land; the others, and the central city itself, are full of
holes. <b>Result: sprawl, invasion of wildlands, loss of farmland,
forced automobilization of former pedestrians, water pollution from
new grading - the whole litany of green laments. High density is not
their cause, but their cure.&nbsp; </b></small><a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of
Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>"The first principle of
    conservation is development, the use of the natural resources now
    existing ... for the benefit of the people who live here now. There may
    be just as much waste in neglecting the development and use of certain
    natural resources as there is in their destruction by waste. ...
    Conservation, then, stands emphatically for the use of substitutes for
    all the exhaustible natural resources, ... (water power and water
    transportation are his examples). ... The development of our natural
    resources and the fullest use of them for the present generation is the
    first duty of this generation. <strong>... </strong></small>
    </p>
    <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention
    of waste.<strong> ... </strong>"</small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, using good central land saves all the costs of
settling on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
Therefore, habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of
conservation our times have forgot. </span>You cannot beat development
by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,
timely renewal of older cities, inner suburbs, and neighborhoods. </span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have met the enemy, and it is
US (Urban Sprawl). Let's analyze
this beast, US. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Urban sprawl, which creates a psychological effect of great
crowding, is not the product of development as such, but of
leapfrogging.<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> Leapfrogging
means chaos, with development in the wrong
places and times. Infilling, on the other hand, is anti-sprawl. It is
the cure for sprawl.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
common belief is that the search of open space is the main force
behind sprawl.</span> You may test that by observing high density,
cookie-cutter subdivisions scattered throughout the land. Within each
such development, you are living at urban densities. It is when you
get onto the freeway to commute, or shop, or take the kids to school
or the dentist, or worship, that you experience open space. You
experience it as a negative resource, an obstacle between where you
are and where you want to go.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
favorite fallacy is that sprawl results from free individual
choice. </span>In fact, sprawl results mainly from subsidies to
sprawl,
enforced through taxation and/or utility rate regulation. Thus it is
imposed, not freely chosen. The classic case, which exemplifies the
whole genus, is postal service. It costs you 29&cent; to send a
letter across the street downtown, or from rural Idaho to rural
Florida. The generic name for such subsidies to sprawl is
"postage-stamp pricing" (a species of spatial cross-subsidy), which
gives you the idea. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those are the carrots. A good
stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there.</span> ... </small><small><small><small><b><a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><small>read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>a. Taxing land
sharpens market incentives via the leverage effect noted earlier.
</b> Thus it makes the land market work better, and follow its
natural infilling, centralizing tendency. Curbing urban sprawl does
not overrule the land market; it is a byproduct of making the market
work better. Richard Hurd, as cited above, noted that land values
are marked by continuity in space. That means the market is telling
owners to develop land contiguously; to anchor new building to
established strength. Sprawl, then, is not market driven, but
market-defying. It is the product of market failure. Georgist
taxation makes the market work better.

<small><b>b. Fosters
resident ownership, civic participation </b></small><small>Riverside,
CA built itself a lovely downtown pedestrian mall, back
when that was in vogue, and has been sorry ever since. Nothing worked
out, retailers deserted, and half the stores are empty. Recently I
asked the developer of Tyler Galleria, a success, why he thought
downtown failed, and got the answer in two words: "absentee
ownership". I should have known, I've preached it for years. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An agricultural adviser in Fresno
once told an impressionable boy
"The best dressing for soil is the owner's shadow, applied daily". In
town they say "Who's keeping the store?" Absentees aren't the
only negligent owners, nor are they all bad. Torpid owners are the
problem and they come in many forms. Basically, to make a city go
you want to be rid of owners who see real estate mainly as a cash cow
for their retirement, and replace them with owners who see it as a
vehicle for their enterprise, who "apply their shadows" daily. Those
shadows will also follow them into local civic clubs, and
enterprising downtown and neighborhood associations for making joint
improvements.</small> <small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">Read

Three Keys to Containing Sprawl</a>

<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The successful solution to sprawl is not some formula. Rather, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">succeeding
against sprawl means having a variety of tools at your disposal, so
that you can shape the best solution for your particular situation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>I baked a birthday cake for my wife a few weeks ago. White cake,
with
pink icing. To serve it, I used a knife to cut the cake, then a sort of
spatula to lift the slice of cake, then a fork to eat the cake. It was
just a simple piece of cake, for crying out loud, but we used three
tools to serve it. Three tools, just to control a piece of cake!</small><br>
<br>
<small>Do you think that sprawl is less complex than a piece of cake? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Do
you think that all sprawl is caused by one simple factor, has one set
of characteristics, and always has the same solution? Of course not.
There are lots of causes of sprawl, and lots of types of sprawl. Sprawl
is more complicated than a piece of cake.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">So how many anti-sprawl tools
do we
need? We need as many as possible. Right now I am going to put three
tools in your anti-sprawl toolkit. </span>They are three general
tools, you can use them in many ways and in many combinations.<a

Walt Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Have We
Forgotten The Foundation?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... misconstrued land
policies led to a sharp decline in the character and quality of life in
our cities and towns. Sprawl ruined the landscape surrounding our
communities. Sprawl promoters and apologists say this is merely an
expansion of the American dream. To me, sprawl is more appropriately
recognized as an American nightmare.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>However, too few have a clue about how to deal with land issues,
or any
notion that archeological digs into our history might provide useful
answers. Instead, consider what's happening:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Habitat volunteers build
houses for the poor, making recipients
and its volunteers feel real good.</span> This is a fine example of
charity
combined with self-help, and it spreads awareness of a great social
ill. But more housing is being abandoned and demolished than Habitat is
able to build.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This same treadmill
effect undermines federal efforts. </span>HUD has
spent billions on public housing, urban renewal and enterprise zones.
Some of these programs have retarded urban decline but their strongest
advocates would not claim they have come close to stopping or reversing
it.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cities offer tax
abatements to revive decaying business
districts. </span>Yet after new buildings are established, the cities
hit
owners with the same tax burden that helped cause decay in the first
place.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some builders turn to
what I call "designer sprawl." </span>They mimic
old towns and are clearly less wasteful of land than unplanned sprawl.
Yet they often invade wheat fields and wood lots far from the job
centers, transit lines and cultural institutions that comprise real
communities -- while large quantities of usable sites that are well
served by infrastructure lie fallow in those real cities and towns.
These stumbling efforts recall an architectural parallel -- when people
first tried rather pathetically to restore old neighborhoods with false
storefronts, tarpaper bricks and Permastone.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public
need to be awakened to the central role
played by taxation. They need to see that loss of our historic land tax
has made speculation our top national sport -- a treacherous one at
that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect
Paul Spreiregen):</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
There is no doubt that the present real property tax...contributes more
to depressing the standard of housing than all government housing
policies combined do to raise it. The current property tax may fairly
be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land values too lightly,
buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use, penalizes good
land use. Consider three identical homes and lots:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec
room, new roof, great landscaping.</span> The
assessor comes by and says, in effect: "As punishment for making a
showplace, and for generating jobs and profits for local businesses,
we're raising your assessment by the amount of your investments. Your
tax bill will go up, not just for a year, but for as long as you keep
the house in good condition."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his
house of the same size run down -- loose
banisters, torn screens, broken gutters, junk-filled yard. </span>The
assessor
tells him, in effect: "Because you created an eyesore for your
neighbors and an unsafe dwelling for your tenants, we're reducing your
assessment and your taxes. If your place is more dilapidated next year,
we'll reduce them even more."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his
building down; the idle lot neither houses
nor employs anybody.</span> The friendly assessor tells him, in effect:
"For
completely wasting your property, and for making no use of the
infrastructure provided for this area, we'll give you the lowest
assessment and tax bill of the three."    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples
condemn not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same
perverse property tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it
any wonder cities are torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only
the half of it. The low land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees
that the annual increase in his or her land value is greater than the
tax bill. This signals the owner to do nothing, to sit back and collect
the values generated by productive neighbors and the community.</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter
the supply of available sites.</span> This raises land prices further,
seducing more speculators into the land game, hastening the flight of
residents and businesses from central cities and even small towns. This
is far from the only cause of sprawl, but one of the most potent. It
cannot be stressed too much because it is one of the least recognized
causes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>If we continue on our present course, overtaxing production and
undertaxing land, the outlook is dismal. It is heading us toward the
very conditions seen in extreme forms in Latin America and other
continents.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Read the

series on sprawl are not from Mars, but many confused the crutches
localities fall back upon as the cause of our region&#8217;s crippling growth
pattern. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Post</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
paints a seemingly hopeless picture because it fails to recognize the
real engines of sprawl &#8212; high land values, land speculation, and
subsidies for development on greenfield sites</span>. Wasteful
scattershot development will outsmart Smart Growth until officials and
voters confront these matters.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">High Land Values.</span> High
land values stem from </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) regional population growth, <br>
2) public works like roads and schools and <br>
3) special natural features like waterfronts. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
For example, a 1980 Congressional study found that Metro, still
unfinished, had already generated $2 billion in new land values, &#8220;the
biggest share of these new values&#8230;going to people lucky enough to own
land within easy access of Metro stations.&#8221; Neither Metro nor the
taxpayers who financed it recoup the values they generated.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speculation</span>. Sprawl
starts at
the center of the metropolis and radiates outward. Smith owns a vacant
downtown site. If he builds offices or housing, he invites risks and
sizeable property tax increases. He keeps his parcel in minimal use
like a parking lot. Brown, seeing its potential, offers to buy it. Yet
Smith who enjoys rising land values without effort asks a price so high
that Brown&#8217;s venture can&#8217;t fly. Brown approaches owners of other
first-class parcels, meets the same hurdle, and finally buys a cheaper
second-class site. More &#8220;Browns&#8221; do the same.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Soon Jones and other enterprisers find owners of second- and
third-class sites boosting their asking prices. Owners get away with
this because land hoarding in the core creates an artificial scarcity
of affordable sites. &#8220;Joneses&#8221; are driven farther into the hinterland.
Developers, denied entry by inflated land prices to close-in sites best
suited for their ventures, invade open space. This race to beat
speculators to cheap land fosters<span style="font-weight: bold;">
leapfrog growth</span>. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidized Sprawl.</span>
Federal and
state spending on misplaced highways, utilities, schools and the like
subsidize premature urbanization of outlying areas. Tax abatements for
malls lay waste to cornfields and forests and sap the vitality of older
communities. ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality Pursues Sprawl.</span>
As
inflated land costs drive middle income families far from choice
central neighborhoods, their new localities duplicate the police, water
systems and schools left behind, plus roads to get them back to work.
High taxes to construct over-extended public facilities spur new home
seekers to go even farther a field.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
real culprits &#8212; upside-down property tax incentives and
inappropriate infrastructure investments &#8212; make it profitable for land
speculators to keep their prime locations in cold storage, to board up
rental housing, and to block the path of normal growth in appropriate
city and town centers.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sprawl Can Be Halted. </span>The
challenge is to take the profit out of sprawl so the massive inventory
of skipped-over prime locations can be put to optimal use.
Jurisdictions can deflate high land and housing costs by altering
current taxes that favor land holding rather than land using. Then the
counties&#8217; crutches, short-term palliatives at best, can be discarded.
Only then can Smart Growth rather than sprawl become the dominant
pattern in our region.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Good for the economy, the PTS is also good
for the eco-system. Were land levied, the owners of the most valuable
sites would feel most pressure to develop; their sites tend to be
closer to the city center. Hence those owners draw any needed
development, infilling cities, sparing suburbs further encroachment.
Other highly valued sites are those rich in natural resources. Again,
using them more intensely frees up sites of lesser natural endowment.
Thus, besides conserving sites, the PTS also conserves resources.<strong> ...</strong><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>The segment of the economy wasting
the most resources is probably
<span style="font-weight: bold;">transportation</span>. Sprawl
exacerbates the need for mobility while
infilling reduces it. Presently, cars claim 50% of urban surface. Land
dues would motivate owners to put their asphalt devoted to cars to
higher and better uses, ones that serve humans. A higher human density
provides mass transit with more riders so that the system could expand
and automobile dependency contract, letting both city and suburb
blossom. ...<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues
feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? Environmentalists should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine. Since about one-fifth of urban areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth. While suburban commercial centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.<br>
<br>
Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of automobiles, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS would replace
is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
owners for improving. This negative incentive does its greatest damage
at the margin, where profit is slim. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There,
rather than pay a higher
tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums. The lack of much tax
on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land. Leap-frog
development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. The resultant
sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
<br>
The PTS reverses all these negative consequences. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than burden
construction, taxing only land spares it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread
development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it
(providing a market for mass transit). 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than inflate land price,
a land tax squashes it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of
prime sites or
itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected site rent
as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher, making home
ownership inflation-proof.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html">How Profit
Shapes Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Like the rest of the universe, US
cities keep expanding. Some time before the
universe begins to contract, American metro
regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck
suburbia back into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most
fundamental forces in the world - money.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of
downtown.
The usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our
present dependency on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to
bring people back.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small> Without spending a penny of subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The present property tax works
backwards, like an
intruder from the anti-universe. It
increases as owners
improve their property; it decreases
when owners let
buildings dilapidate. "Save money,
create slums," cities
tell owners.&nbsp;
...</small><br>
<br>
<small> If the property tax is a
centrifugal force that
flings structures
outward, its opposite is
a land levy, a centripetal
force that pulls development inward. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>"They'll put their land to uses that
generate much more
revenue than does an empty building or
car-covered
lot," adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy
building
apartments, stores, offices, schools,
theaters, mixing
all uses together to maximize their
return."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Post-PTS, would these speculators
turned developers
find customers? Or would potential
customers continue
to set up shop and home out in the
cheaper 'burbs?
Many house-hunters are drawn to where
all the
amenities are in walking distance.
Many shopkeepers
locate where people walk about. Other
businesses
collect themselves close to their
suppliers and
customers. There are plenty of takers
for new
downtown development.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> At least that's what land values tell
us. Land values
merely reflect the desirability of
locations. The more
people want on, the more they must
pay. The lots that
people are willing to pay the most for
are the heart of
the city.
</small><br>
<small>... </small><br>
<small>... As does nature, her
defenders might also
want to abhor a vacuum.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Letting one city block lie
fallow means paving
over many suburban
acres," calculates Gaffney, consultant
to Alaska on oil
royalties. "Conversely, using one
block intensely means
many outlying acres need not be used
at all." The
biggest gain in saving suburban land
comes from using
urban land more efficiently.</span>&nbsp; ... &nbsp; <a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public,
governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
</span>Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are
not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy.</small></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

homeowners borrow against for a bout of consumeritis. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The property tax assessment is skewed
toward
the building, away from the land, benefiting speculators and

Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Property taxes shape the pattern
of our cities. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes
on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are
low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Relatively low taxes on land and
high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many
disadvantages besides: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really

  <li><small>the building developer has to go far out to find available

  <li><small>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>traffic on congested roads will increase and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>new roads and schools will have to be built.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is generally believed that zoning
laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities.
Zoning laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody
can be forced to improve his land and to build unless there is an
incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning
laws. With
both these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but
-- as experience has shown -- without land taxation rational and
efficient land usage becomes impossible. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into
wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city. ...&nbsp; <small><small><big><big><a

Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land's
value goes up when population
increases and technological and economic development make labor more
productive. Those who "own" land often withhold it from use, expecting
to capture its increased value in the future -- thus, the possession of
land enables people to take an income that they did nothing to produce.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Speculative withholding of land
has disastrous consequences. Peasants who seek land on which to survive
are pushed out to poorer and poorer lands.</span> These "sub-marginal"
lands become their alternative place for self-employment. With such a
poor alternative, they have no choice but to accept very low wages.
Rent -- the payment to landowners -- absorbs more of the wealth
produced on all sites.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land speculation also prevents development near the center of
cities,
pushing it to the outskirts while the center decays from neglect and
slums increase. The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl</span>"
engulfs farms and forests, even as it raises the price of land, making
use and development more costly.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Rapid destruction of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil dramatizes
how
the unnatural phenomenon of sprawl has an ominous worldwide impact on
the environment. In Brazil, ten per cent of the landowners own 80
percent of the land, while one million peasants are forced off the land
each year. And a mere one per cent controls 48 percent of the
cultivable land. The only place in Brazil where there is land for the
taking is in the Amazon rain forest. The destruction of the rain forest
is caused by a system that perpetuates artificial land shortages.
Nearly four-fifths of Brazil's arable land is covered by sprawling
latifundios, most of which are held by speculators who produce nothing.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here is the root cause of
poverty.
When laborers are faced with the choice of either bare subsistence
wages or land that can barely maintain life, labor itself is
marginalized and cannot effectively bargain on its own behalf. Wages,
generally, on all land, are driven down toward the point of bare
subsistence. Returns to capital are also depressed for the same reason,
deterring investment. When this is carried to an extreme -- when people
can no longer afford the goods being produced and when there is little
profit in applying capital -- the economy collapses. The inflated land
market, on which the speculative frenzy has fed, collapses too.&nbsp; </span></small><small><a

Land Values</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small><br>
<small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. The community added to the market value to land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. </span>This raises the cost of community improvements
and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that
we face is that cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Efficient land use appeals to all
people because it surpasses the
political constraints of most people. Everybody understands that the
earth belongs equally to all people. They want a clean environment on
earth and to leave a healthy inheritance to the future generations,
regardless of their political viewpoints.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small>The major function of a competent city government is to provide
good community services by collecting the land rent created within
the community to ensure the efficient use of land and equal
opportunities for all of its citizens. Transportation is an important
function of government which would facilitate the creation of a
compact city, where people can easily find the facilities they desire
for education, commerce, religion and recreation. Good
land use, with the freedom of individuals to achieve the highest and
best use of land, would ensure a desirable community. A compact city
would reduce the need to invade the wilderness and devastate the
environment. ... <a

</small><br>
<small>We utilize less than 5% of the total land area in the United
States for urban purposes, including housing, commerce, and
manufacturing. As you fly across the country all you see is farm,
timber, desert and an occasional small community. While less than 5%
of our nation's land area is needed for urban purposes, much vacant
land within existing cities is bypassed because it is cheaper to
build further out than pay the high prices demanded for the more
efficient, better located, land. The result is urban sprawl. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Why do
we choose to utilize land distant from employment, social, and civic
needs while bypassing superior land? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do many of us choose to
spend two hours each day commuting to work? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do our older cities
fail to renew or rebuild obsolete buildings? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sprawl is not just about
the density of land use. In many cities only one half of the land is
devoted to housing and commercial uses while the other half is vacant
or under-improved. Could it be that there are inefficient
requirements built into some public policies? Smart growth should not
be constrained by archaic patterns that impede or misappropriate free
and open urban land usage. Local ordinances and practices within
cities that force accelerated suburban sprawl should be abolished. We
don't need more regulation, we need greater freedom to act
responsibly. Individuals should have the opportunity to decide
whether they want to live in the suburbs or in the city. This should
not be a coerced decision because of a public policy that impedes
growth within the city. Simple tax reform can help to achieve some of
the goals and objectives of smart growth without government
intervention and wasteful subsidies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If land holders can produce a
higher return on investment by not
using land for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher
price from those willing and able to pay the higher price in the
future, there is a flaw in public policy. Public policy thereby gives
speculative, nonproductive investment a higher return than productive
investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production and
distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from
public improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
reduce sprawl.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One example that I know is that of
a friend who bought land within
the city but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money
into an investment that had no visible return? He replied that, by
holding the land for future sale or development, his long term
return, in capital gains would exceed 18% annually. If he built a
building on the site now, his long term return would only be 12%
annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should he
use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use
it, but to hold it for a larger future gain?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most major cities have a
substantial amount of fully serviced but
unused or underused land sites. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><b>Counterproductive
growth limitations and regulations should be abolished.</b> </small><br>
<small>Property
taxes should not be levied on new construction or existing
improvements, when the revenue needed could be obtained from the land
values created and maintained by the community.
</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The property tax could be
shifted to reduce the incentives for
sprawl. If the property tax were taken off urban buildings and
focused on the land itself, this would penalize land speculation and
would reward people who build on their land.</span> Thus land
speculation,
which promotes a "leap frog" development out of the city and into the
surrounding countryside, would decrease. The proposed shift from
traditional property tax to a "land value tax" would penalize land
speculation and encourage urban redevelopment. Removing the tax on
buildings makes them cheaper to construct, renovate and operate, and
more affordable to buy or rent. Urban construction creates urban
jobs. Capital and labor both benefit.</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ....</span><br>
<small>One means that has long been available but not brought into
general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
market for speculation a costly proposition. An annual fee on land
should be set near what the land site alone would yield if rented by
the owner to the highest bidder. Think of how this would change the
behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of land with a rental
value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged me as
my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would
either develop the land myself or put it on the market so that
someone else would develop it. At the same time, if my tax rate on
the building I constructed on the land was zero, my incentive is to
construct a building that maximizes my cash flow (i.e., to develop
the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At minimum,
land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto the
market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to
builders would tend to begin to fall over time.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is where the anti-sprawl
component appears. As the city
begins to renew itself -- as property owners are no longer penalized
when they renovate or build new structures -- businesses and people
will increasingly see the city as a more desirable place and not just
in a few neighborhoods that now benefit by abatement programs and
public subsidies.&nbsp;</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By utilizing land within cities
efficiently and in response to the
demand for its use, open space and natural habitats outside the city
will be conserved. If urban land is used to its highest and best use,
farm land and environmentally sensitive land will not be required for
inappropriate uses. Builders and developers would not have to bypass
serviced but vacant land to construct housing at a further distance
from where it is needed or wanted. ... <a

increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first

time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All society needed to do was to collect the
economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The most compelling arguments to many supporters stem from its
environmental consequences. A tax on land sites is the most powerful
instrument available to neutralize and reverse the centrifugal forces
of urban sprawl. This is because incentives are present &#8212; the higher
the tax the more power it has &#8212; to improve the high-value sites to the
full extent that their market value warrants. Titleholders are induced
to build on their parcels in order to recover the carrying costs of
their increased taxes. The inelastic supply of land sites means that
taxes are shouldered fully by owners, without being passed on to
tenants. (Of course a tenant&#8217;s charges can be raised anytime.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Hence
urban areas tend to be improved and peripheral areas become less
attractive to sprawl development.</span> George saw a strong moral
argument
for shifting from the conventional property tax levied on both land and
improvements to one based on land alone. The argument was quite simple:
the tax as it stood penalized people who improved their property and
rewarded people who held vacant parcels for speculative gain. It
rewarded those owners who let their holdings go to wrack and ruin,
often those who bought up parcels to use as rental property without
investing in the maintenance to ensure that they would continue to be
attractive and livable &#8212; slumlords. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The collection of land rent has other consequences for the
smooth and
effective functioning of the economy as well. With respect to the
configurations of land use in urban areas, the collect of land rent
neutralizes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces which the
current real property tax (i.e. that on both land and improvements)
exerts on the values of locational sites. In fact one eminent economist
argues that a tax on land sites is &#8220;better than neutral,&#8221; because it
fosters activity in the highest value areas and removes the factor of
adverse timing that often stalls economic investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small> This
all leads to the economic vitality of high-land-value cities, simply by
virtue of concentrating activity in central areas instead of peripheral
and remote regions. It discourages the extravagant and careless
development of land sites,
thereby also fostering development densities conducive to community
welfare and to the success of public transit services.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">52</span></small>
Experts agree that the minimum density necessary to make public transit
services economically viable is 10 to 12 households per acre; without
this, there is little prospect of altering private automobile
dependency.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">53</span></small>
And given the widespread environmentally and socially destructive
consequences of motor vehicle dependency, collecting rent is half the
answer toward the goal of engendering livable urban areas. (The other
half &#8212; see below &#8212; is pricing motor vehicle use at its true marginal
cost to society.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>The more cohesive the development of communities is, the greater
the
synergy exists among its members. Sprawl development not only increases
the cost of transportation and other infrastructure needed to service
these sites, it also reduces the extent to which people are accessible
to one another. There is considerable indication that American society
is losing this elusive quality of community. When Harvard professor
Robert Putnam published his celebrated article <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span> in January, 1995, it
was remarkable as much for the resonance that it generated throughout
the nation as for the message itself. David Broder of the Washington
Post pronounced <span style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span>
the most important academic article that year. Putnam argued that our
communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
cooperative and communal nature.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">54</span></small> We
used to be a nation of joiners; increasingly now we&#8217;re a nation of
loners. As Tocqueville noted 150 years ago, affiliative groups used to
be the unique strength of American society.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">55</span></small>
Several hypotheses were offered in this and subsequent studies to
explain the decline in the civic engagement of Americans &#8212; various
demographic changes, technological innovations such as television, the
changing role of government, the cultural revolution, and so on. The
land-use and transportation patterns that have evolved in the post-war
period are a factor as well. The concepts of neighborhood and community
today no longer mean the same thing as they
did in the past. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Recent days have witnessed a profound and growing awareness of
the
problems due to sprawl development. In fact one opinion poll marked
sprawl as the highest current concern among American voters.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">60</span></small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">61</span></small>
Solutions such as these reflect the penchant of policy makers to rely
upon so-called &#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC) approaches to government
rather than &#8220;pricing&#8221; approaches. The extension of government reach and
weight to impose policies deemed appropriate is burdensome, expensive,
and inefficient. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>And yet, for pricing to work at all, there must be both supply
and
demand; the lack of either results in there being no market price at
all. Is it possible, perhaps, that policies might be developed where
demand for certain resources are reduced to zero &#8212; and hence no price?
To some extent this is how the Georgist economics approach works. It
leaves certain realms of the commons unthreatened by exploitation for
the reason that the attention of the market is focused elsewhere. By
the collection of economic rent the prices of resources are effectively
shifted, so much so that the market arena is profoundly altered.
Resource prices are shifted in such a way that their use is curtailed
and their consumption concentrated. It was noted earlier, for example,
that collection of land rent tends to reverse the centrifugal forces of
sprawl, actualizing demand at the core of urban areas and leaving
remote regions uninhabited and
intact. Economic rent accrues to sites that have high demand and
frequent use; collecting that economic rent tends to concentrate their
use in ways that discourages speculative practices, allocate their use
to those who can best maximize their utility, and leave other sites and
commodities in remote areas less affected by human activity. So also
with charges for other public resources such as radio frequencies and
airport landing slots. Pricing incentives are established in such a way
that economic activity is intensified, concentrated, and integrated
without the need of artificial CAC instruments such as zoning, urban
growth boundaries, community land trusts, and other devices which are
expensive to implement and have notable records of failure.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of how urban
sprawl has
sapped community cohesion and creativity. In part it is the land use
configurations themselves that have been responsible, fostered by the
decisions of realtors and developers to capitalize on the promise of
speculative gain to be had by people who settle at the periphery of
urban areas and then see their land values rise. But current reversals
in public sentiment about suburban lifestyles suggest that community
cohesion is once more appreciated. This reversal of preferences may
favor measures that will foster development of landsites with the
highest value, reducing motor vehicle dependency and infrastructure
costs. It is no accident, perhaps, that rankings of the most livable
cities in the country correlate most strongly with those that are most
bicycle friendly.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Greater proximity in development can lead to greater guarantees
for the
preservation of unsettled areas, leaving tracts of nature undisturbed
by the inroads of human presence. This too may have the ironic effect
of fostering greater community with nature. Certainly millions of
backyards with gas grills and lawns to mow are a poor substitute for
pastoral lifestyles. Ecological economics makes clear to people the
interdependency between urban and rural, past and future, life and
lore, far better than the conspicuous consumption fostered by
conventional economic pursuits. Daly himself writes approvingly of land
value taxation, even though he has little to say about Henry George or
about collecting economic rent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">131</span></small>
Ecological economics hunts for a continuum between economic value and
non-pecuniary value, without finding a clear boundary for either.
Georgism, in contrast, encourages a precipitous fall-off in economic
prices at the periphery of human presence, simply on account of the
fact that rent recovery reverses the centrifugal impetus of
conventional market forces. The continuum asserts itself.... <a

</a>The
answers being offered, however, don&#8217;t address the root causes of the
problem. The most talked about panacea is the institution of urban
growth boundaries, but these have failed to be demonstrably successful
even in the two communities most often cited (Portland and Boulder)

  <p>SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATIONS are not natural. Were it not for incentives
      to the contrary, people would choose to live and work in close proximity. This
      has been well documented in studies of every era and place.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></font> Only
      when incentives are put in place that induce people to live in other circumstances
      do they choose settlement patterns that are remote, less accessible, and alienating.
      Only in the industrial era and after have outlying areas become more attractive.
      Tracing the history of such developments makes it clear that they are a response
      to less livable conditions of urban life as they have evolved -- the pollution
      of air and water, loss of nature, loss of privacy, housing deficiencies, and
      so on. In more recent years, differentials in taxation and the quality of services
      (such as schools) have also played a role in making the suburbs more attractive.
      ...</p>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
  <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
      are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium of
      forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation to
          users and <br>
                2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                    is really the socially created value. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
      investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
      and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
      to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing the land
      rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is socially created value, which
      is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than allowing
      it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property dose by. User
      fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
      as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
      with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
      ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
      charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
      accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
      and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
      use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
  <p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
      and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with the
      costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom, it
      is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
      level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be linked
      to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption, to the
      full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental ambiences.
      Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing design for
      highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
      The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
      average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68
      billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours
      stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
      times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes
      one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But
      not all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
      time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people to
      impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored
      in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway space. In
      a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a form of land
      rent. ...</p>
  <p>Just as recovering the costs of transportation service equilibrates costs
      and benefits on one side of the equation, recovering the economic rent accruing
      to land value facilitates efficient space configurations on the other side.
      Figure 10.2, again conceptually, portrays how the collection of various transportation
      user fees as well as the recovery of land rent corrects the economic distortions
      that today result in sprawl development. The shaded area indicates the pricing
      correctives necessary to ensure that neither urban nor rural land sites are
      disadvantaged in travel or location choices that individuals make for either
      residential or commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>As it happens, collecting land rent is a relatively simple operation: It involves
      a small computer adjustment in the assessment base of what is now the local
      real property tax. The real property tax to an economist is really two separate
      taxes: that put on land value and that put on improvement values. A gradual
      phaseout of the tax on the improvement component, shifting totally to a tax
      on the land, recovers economic rent in a way that satisfies all the principles
      of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[35]</em></strong></font> It
      is efficient, neutral, equitable, administrate, stable, and simple. It is also
      absolutely foolproof: One cannot hide land or take it to a remote tax haven.
      It relieves poor households (who typically own no land) of any tax burden and
      rewards those titleholders who use their sites efficiently. <strong>High-value
      sites are induced to construct high-value improvements, and low-value sites
      are left
      alone. In this way, central locations, where commercial enterprises typically
      locate, pay according to their intensity; home owners, who typically locate
      at the periphery of a neighborhood community, pay moderately; and agricultural
      land and forestlands pay little if anything. </strong>By an automatic and natural
      process, the centrifugal forces of sprawl development are reversed, and investment
      is
      encouraged in core locales. The higher density resulting affords the necessary

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Concerns about urban policies also raise questions about the current relevance
    of Georgist ideas. For example, it is pertinent to ask whether a more uniform
    land tax would encourage the more efficient utilisation of urban space. George
    argued that, in order to cover the costs of a higher rate of land tax, landowners
    would be forced to put their land to its most productive use, and could not
    afford to hold it idle. Here is a clear link with the modern concerns to
    discourage &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and to promote &#8216;urban consolidation.&#8217; To
    the extent that a higher land tax would encourage the development of more
    housing in existing urban areas, the pressures for housing development in
    outlying areas would be significantly reduced. This, in turn, could reduce
    the burgeoning demand for transport that is currently characteristic of large
    cities.</p>
  <p>Land tax also impacts on the politics of peripheral urban expansion. Currently,
    the prospect of huge capital gains resulting from decisions by local governments
    to rezone land from rural to urban acts as an incentive for landowners on
    the fringes of built-up areas to lobby for changes that will allow increased
    development. Hence, landowners push for rights to subdivision, irrespective
    of whether or not there is actual demand (Day, 1995: 3). By creaming off
    the gains from windfall increases in land values, land tax obviates this
    bias towards relentless urban expansion.</p>
  <p>However, the question remains: would a uniform land tax be sufficient to
    produce more efficient patterns of urban development? Or would there still
    be a need for direct land use controls? Land tax can certainly be a tool
    for discouraging the wasteful use of land. It tends to discourage people
    from purchasing excessive amounts of land or leaving it idle. However, it
    may also encourage the overdevelopment of land in order to produce the income
    stream necessary to pay the higher rate of tax.</p>
  <p>Critics of urban consolidation such as Patrick Troy (1996) have examined
    the potential problems of such overdevelopment, including a range of environmental
    impacts such as altered hydrological processes. It seems to be an overly
    bold claim that a Georgist land tax alone would be sufficient to achieve
    optimal urban development patterns. Land use controls a necessary adjunct
    to land tax - in setting minimum requirements for green space, for example.</p>
  <p>Local government planning controls are also important to prevent incompatibility
    of land uses, such the development of hazardous or unhealthy industrial activities
    adjacent to residential areas. Targeted decentralisation policies are a means
    of encouraging the further development of regional centres. Such policies
    can work in conjunction with land taxes to ease growth pressures in the larger
    cities, while addressing long-standing spatial, social and economic inequalities
    (Stilwell, 2000: 254-260). The desirability of promoting more decentralised
    regional development is consistent with a Georgist perspective, but not altogether
    compatible with the claim that land tax would facilitate urban consolidation.
    It seems clear that it &#8216;overburdens&#8217; land tax to expect it alone
    to produce the best spatial outcomes, taking account of all the economic,
    social and environmental issues involved in urban and regional policy. The
    various other policy instruments &#8211; including regulations relating to
    green space, zoning, and the provision of public infrastructure to pave the
    way for decentralisation &#8211; are important complements to land taxation.
    In other words, land tax is best regarded as a necessary but not sufficient
    condition for more effective spatial policy. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What&#8217;s also nice about the new operating system is that, once installed,
    it can&#8217;t be easily removed. That&#8217;s because it relies on property
    rights rather than government programs that are subject to political ebb
    and flow. If you have any doubt about this, consider the staying power of
    Social Security and the Alaska Permanent Fund, both of which distribute periodic
    payments that have attained the status of property rights. Social Security
    is over seventy years old and has never been cut once; in 2005, it survived
    a privatization campaign led by President Bush. Similarly, the Alaska Permanent
    Fund, now more than twenty-five years old, repelled an attempt in 1999 to
    divert part of its income to the state treasury.</p>
  <p>This third version of capitalism is a logical successor to the first two.
    In Capitalism 1.0 we had a shortage of goods, in Capitalism 2.0 a surplus.
    In Capitalism 3.0 we&#8217;ll have plenty, but not too much. We&#8217;ll
    have more things we truly need &#8212; healthier ecosystems, communities,
    culture &#8212; and fewer thneeds. We&#8217;ll have a proper balance between
    our &#8220;me&#8221; and our &#8220;we&#8221; sides. We&#8217;ll be more
    connected and less isolated, more secure and less stressed. Overall, I&#8217;d
    venture, we&#8217;ll be happier.</p>
  <p>We&#8217;ll have some new traffic rules on this road. Rights now enjoyed
    exclusively by private capital will be matched, or even trumped, by rights
    held in trust for future generations. Similarly, the ability of private wealth
    owners to receive income and inheritances will be matched by the ability
    of everyone to receive them. And risks we now face individually, such as
    illness, will be tempered by shared risk pools that exclude no one.</p>
  <p>The biggest change will be in the third algorithm I described in chapter
    4: the price of nature will no longer be zero. Instead, the price of nature &#8212; or
    at least, of the scarcest and most endangered parts of nature &#8212; will
    gradually rise. This will compel corporations (and consumers) to internalize
    many of the costs they now externalize.</p>
  <p>This, in turn, will drive them to invest and consume in ways that, over
    time, do less harm to nature. Businesses will invest in clean and renewable
    energy technologies. Farmers will use fewer chemicals, and local food will
    outcompete food grown far away. Consumers will shift from driving alone in
    gas-guzzlers to more convivial forms of transport and less dashing about.
    Housing will move from sprawling suburbs to small towns and tall cities.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>Some explanations
reflect downright corruption. The earliest cars
manufactured in this country and in Europe were electric;
streetcars also were largely electric powered until a conspiracy of the
automobile and petroleum industry exerted its force to ensure that
fossil fuel powered motor vehicles would dominate our transportation
and land use patterns.</big><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> Our
motor-vehicle-dependent and urban sprawl
configurations can be explained by powerful interests continually
pressing for policies to make us so. One might even conclude that the
decision to drive on the right side of the road was equally as much a
defining moment. </small><small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>15 This is an untold story. A
trial was held in a Chicago federal
court in 1949, resulting in an indictment of GM, Firestone, Standard
Oil, Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks among others. Their crime
was in forming a holding company called National City Lines which
proceeded in the preceding decade to buy up the public transportation
services in dozens of US cities, and then scrapping them so that
people would then become more automobile dependent. The corporations
were fined $5,000 each, and the CEOs of each one $1. See United
States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 93rd Congress, 2nd
Session, &#8220;American Ground Transport: A Proposal for
Restructuring the Automobile, Truck, Bus, and Rail Industries,&#8221;
by Bradford C. Snell, February 26, 1974 (Washington: US Government
Printing Office, 1974); and Jonathan Kwitney, &#8220;The Great
Transportation Conspiracy,&#8221; Harper&#8217;s Magazine, February,
1981.</small></div>

<small>And I hope that you will forgive me for mentioning another great
conspiracy in American history, the subject of my <a

presentation about four years ago</a>. That story recounted how the
American railroad industry, in collusion with the banks, induced the
founders of the American economics profession to change definitions and
formulas so that they would be relieved of taxation on their land
holdings and speculation would be rewarded.<small><span

dividing line
between classical and neoclassical economics is responsible I believe
for many of our economic problems today &#8212; economic cycles, an
inequitable
tax structure, poverty and unemployment, urban sprawl and the gutting
of urban centers. Only now is this economic ideology, almost sacrosanct
for a century, falling apart and seen for what it is. ... <a
