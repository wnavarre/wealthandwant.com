          Also known as a citizen's dividend or a social salary</p>
          <p>Georgists generally agree that Henry George's Remedy &#8212; the collection
        of the rental value of land as our common treasure &#8212; is necessary
        if we are every to have social and economic justice and genuine equality.
        They don't all agree, however, about whether it should be distributed
        as an income
        to all citizens, as Alaska's Permanent Fund is, or used to fund our common
        spending. (I fall into the latter category, because I am convinced that
        in addition to the necessity of collecting rent, we must also lift taxes
        off
        trade (sales) and labor (income and wage taxes.)</p>
          <p>For the past few years, there has been an annual meeting of a group called
        USBIG, the US Basic Income Group, in conjunction with the Eastern Economic
        Association. My sense is that most people who attend that conference are
        convinced of the need for a basic income for everyone, as a way to reduce
        poverty,
        but
        that they aren't much interested in how to fund it, and don't see the importance
        of <em><strong>not</strong></em> funding it from income taxes or sales taxes on other people's labor
        or purchases. Georgists, on the other hand, know exactly how to fund it,
        but are not agreed on whether that funding should flow to individuals directly,
        or be used to lift oppressive taxation.</p>

              whatever taxes and regulations
              their citizens choose. Anyone who is dissatisfied can live elsewhere.
              While communities would be permitted to tax wages and interest if
              they wished, they would find it attractive to do so only if their
              citizens were content with such sharing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The primary source of
              financing for communities would be the rental value of land and other
              natural opportunities. Because the provision of a worthwhile local
              public good generally raises rent by enough to pay for the good,
              communities would generally be able to finance themselves with only a
              fraction of the rent of land.</span> The rest of rent could provide as
              a
              basic income for all. <strong>...</strong><br>
          <br>
          Support for those who are unable to provide for themselves would
              come from this basic income, from the generosity of the fellow
              citizens of their community, and from insurance that their parents
              might reasonably be expected to provide for them in a world in which
              all parents received justice themselves.</small>&nbsp; <small><a

              Maybe three-fourths. If spending is truly worthwhile, then, as

          approval of nearly everyone.</span></small></div>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The current trend toward returning
functions to the states is a
step in the right direction. But it encounters understandable
objections that poor states cannot afford to do what they ought to
do. Some form of revenue sharing is needed. But it is important to
have the right definition of which states are rich and which are
poor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The level of well-being in a
state is determined in part by the
wisdom of its public policies. </span>States should not be penalized
for
adopting productive policies.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Revenue
sharing should equalize per
capita levels of natural opportunities (mineral revenues, fishing
rights, pre-development land rents, etc.) </span>Replacing the
personal and
corporate income taxes with either a flat income tax or a national
sales or value added tax would greatly reduce the excess burden of
federal taxes. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excess burden is
roughly proportional to the square
of the typical marginal tax rate.</span>) But almost all the gains go
to the
rich. Perhaps the flat tax could be combined with a guaranteed
income. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html"><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site Value Rating</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>The three sources of land rent, the gift of nature, public services and
      community development, lead logically to the justice of three distinct taxes
      on land.</b> The gift of nature is primarily the agricultural value of land,
      but also the value of natural resources and the extra value of land near
      rivers and harbors that arises because such land represents good places to
      put cities whether or not cities are presently there. This component of the
      rental value of
  land should be collected <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">nationally </span>and used to
  support a guaranteed income for all citizens. The part of land value that arises
  from public services is justly the income of the community that provides those
  services. When private individuals and firms undertake activities that raise
  the rental value of surrounding land, the value thereby created should justly
  be awarded to those whose actions
  create it. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., <a href="../docs/King_Where.htm">Where Do
We Go From Here?</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be
    made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position
    we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted.
    New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for
    those for whom traditional jobs are not available. In 1879 Henry George anticipated
    this state of affairs when he wrote in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind, the
      work which extends knowledge and increases power and enriches literature
      and elevates thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work
      of slaves driven to their tasks either by the task, by the taskmaster,
      or by animal necessity. It is the work of men who somehow find a form of
      work that brings a security for its own sake and a state of society where
      want is abolished. [Book IX: Effects of the Remedy; Chapter 4: Of the changes
      that would be wrought in social organization and social life]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Work of this sort could be enormously increased, and we are likely to find
    that the problems of housing and education, instead of preceding the elimination
    of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The
    poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter
    housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect
    on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in
    their struggle.</p>
  <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
    will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
    will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
    when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among
    husbands, wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of
    human worth on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
  <p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
    annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And
    I say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
    a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
    to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
    on their own two feet right here on earth. ... <a href="../docs/King_Where.htm">read
