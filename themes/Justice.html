    Increasing Importance of Social Questions </a>(Chapter 1 of <em><a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
    Problems</a></em>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[20] In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
    the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
    This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
    having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But the
    salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of humanity,
    is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ. Social progress
    makes the well-being of all more and more the business of each; it binds
    all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can escape. He who
    observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes
    no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden
    under foot, save now and then to bestow aims, is not a true Christian. Nor
    is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder than this.</p>
  <p>[21] The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not
    a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
    and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond self-interest,
    whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many. It must seek justice.
    For at the bottom of every social problem we will find a social wrong. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

      <p>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility
        of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the
        produce of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
        of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some
        one else from whom the right has passed to him. For the right to the
        produce of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use
        of the opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property
        in these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
        nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by producers,
        the right of the producers to the fruits of their labor is to that extent
        denied.</p>
      <p>A house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being
        the subject of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real

        <li> The one is produced by human labor, and belongs to the class in

        <li> The other is a part of nature, and belongs to the class in political
          economy styled land.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody
        labor, are brought into being by human exertion, their existence or nonexistence,
        their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character
        of the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist
        irrespective of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the
        field or environment in which man finds himself; the storehouse from
        which his needs must be supplied, the raw material upon which and the
        forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>
      <p>The moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that
        the sanction which natural justice gives to one species of property is
        denied to the other. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/06_The_Remedy.htm">read

    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
    is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This
    is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land,
    are in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community,
      then will the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will
      have an advantage
      over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns.</strong> Then, but not till
      then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> ... The story goes on to describe
how the roads of heaven, the

angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth

Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In
allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
as material progress goes on.</span> This is the subtle alchemy that in
ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
anarchy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is this that turns the
blessings of material progress into a
curse. It is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and
squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads
men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs women of the
grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little
children the joy and innocence of life&#8217;s morning. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Civilization so based cannot
continue. The eternal laws of the
universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness
that is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something
grander than Benevolence, something more august than Charity &#8212; it
is Justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. Justice
that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice that
with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with
liturgies and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by
raising churches when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;But if, while there is
yet
time, we turn to Justice and obey
her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
threaten must disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to
agencies of elevation. Think of the powers now wasted; of the
infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?
Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
vision which has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor.
It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is
the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the City of God on earth, with
its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is the reign of the

Henry George: <a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The Single
Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think about what the value of
land is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justice
therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider the difference between
the value of a building and the
value of land</b>. The value of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community. It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... It is thus a violation of
justice to tax labor, or the things
produced by labor, and it is also a violation of justice <span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nor is it asking justice when
employers are asked to pay their
working-men more than they are compelled to pay &#8211; more than they could
get others to do the work for. It is asking charity. For the surplus
that the employer thus gives is not in reality wages, it is essentially
alms.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Among measures suggested for the
improvement of the condition
of labor much stress is sometimes laid upon charity. But there is
nothing practical in such recommendations as a cure for poverty. If it
were possible for the giving of alms to abolish poverty, there would be
no poverty in Christendom!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charity is indeed a noble and
beautiful virtue, grateful to
man and approved by God. But charity must be built on justice. It
cannot supersede justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is wrong with the condition
of labor is that labor is
robbed. And while the continuance of that robbery is sanctioned it is
idle to urge charity.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All that charity can do where
injustice exists is here and
there to mollify the effects of injustice. It cannot cure them.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nor is even what little it can do
to mollify the effects of
injustice without evil. For what may be called the super-imposed, and,
in this sense, secondary virtues, work evil where the fundamental or
primary virtues are absent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus sobriety is a virtue and
diligence is a virtue. But a
sober and diligent thief is all the more dangerous. Thus patience is a
virtue. But patience under wrong is the condoning of wrong. Thus it is
a virtue to seek knowledge and to endeavour to cultivate the mental
powers. But the wicked man becomes more capable of evil by reason of
his intelligence. Devils we always think of as intelligent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Charity based upon injustice works
evil.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That pseudo charity that discards
and denies justice works
evil.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the one side, it demoralises
its recipients, outraging
human dignity, and turning into beggars and paupers men who, to become
self-supporting, self-respecting citizens, only need the restitution of
what God has given them.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other side, it acts as an <font
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff6600">anodyne</font>
to the consciences of those who are living on the robbery of their
fellows, and fosters that moral delusion and spiritual pride that
Christ doubtless had in mind when He said it was easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
Kingdom of Heaven! For it leads men steeped in injustice, and using
their money and their influence to bolster up injustice, to think that
in giving alms they are doing something more than their duty towards
man and deserve to be very well thought of by God.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Worse perhaps than all else is the
way in which the
substituting of injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of
justice opens an easy means for professed teachers of the Christian
religion of all branches and communions to placate Mammon while
persuading themselves that they are serving God!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Had the English clergy not
subordinated the teaching of
justice to the teaching of charity &#8211; to go no further in illustrating a
principle of which the whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s
time to our own is witness &#8211; the Tudor tyranny would never have arisen;
had the clergy of France never substituted charity for justice, the
monstrous iniquities of the ancient regime would never have brought the
horrors of the Great Revolution; and in my own country, had those who
should have preached justice not satisfy themselves with preaching
kindness, <b>chattel slavery</b> could never have demanded the
holocaust of our civil war.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No; as faith without works is
dead, as men cannot give to God
His due while denying to their fellows the rights He gave them, so
charity, unsupported by justice, can do nothing to solve the problem of
the existing condition of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow

<blockquote>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it,
    what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
    deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The
    existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p><strong>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights
      we do not seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by
      faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all.</strong> <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p>In speaking of the practical measures for the improvement of the condition
    of labor which your Holiness suggests, I have not mentioned what you place
    much stress upon &#8212; charity. But there is nothing practical in such
    recommendations as a cure for poverty, nor will any one so consider them.
    If it were possible for the giving of alms to abolish poverty there would
    be no poverty in Christendom.</p>
  <p>Charity is indeed a noble and beautiful virtue, grateful to man and approved
    by God. But charity must be built on justice. It cannot supersede justice.</p>
  <p>What is wrong with the condition of labor through the Christian world is
    that labor is robbed. And while you justify the continuance of that robbery
    it is idle to urge charity. To do so &#8212; to commend charity as a substitute
    for justice, is indeed something akin in essence to those heresies, condemned
    by your predecessors, that taught that the gospel had superseded the law,
    and that the love of God exempted men from moral obligations.</p>
  <p>All that charity can do where injustice exists is here and there to mollify
    somewhat the effects of injustice. It cannot cure them. Nor is even what
    little it can do to mollify the effects of injustice without evil. For what
    may be called the superimposed, and in this sense, secondary virtues, work
    evil where the fundamental or primary virtues are absent. Thus sobriety is
    a virtue and diligence is a virtue. But a sober and diligent thief is all
    the more dangerous. Thus patience is a virtue. But patience under wrong is
    the condoning of wrong. Thus it is a virtue to seek knowledge and to endeavor
    to cultivate the mental powers. But the wicked man becomes more capable of
    evil by reason of his intelligence. Devils we always think of as intelligent.</p>
  <p>And thus that pseudo-charity that discards and denies justice works evil.
    On the one side, it demoralizes its recipients, outraging that human dignity
    which as you say &#8220;God himself treats with reverence,&#8221; and turning
    into beggars and paupers men who to become self-supporting, self-respecting
    citizens need only the restitution of what God has given them. On the other
    side, it acts as an anodyne to the consciences of those who are living on
    the robbery of their fellows, and fosters that moral delusion and spiritual
    pride that Christ doubtless had in mind when he said it was easier for a
    camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
    Kingdom of Heaven. For it leads men steeped in injustice, and using their
    money and their influence to bolster up injustice, to think that in giving
    alms they are doing something more than their duty toward man and deserve
    to be very well thought of by God, and in a vague way to attribute to their
    own goodness what really belongs to God&#8217;s goodness. For consider: Who
    is the All-Provider? Who is it that as you say, &#8220;owes to man a storehouse
    that shall never fail,&#8221; and which &#8220;he finds only in the inexhaustible
    fertility of the earth.&#8221; Is it not God? And when, therefore, men, deprived
    of the bounty of their God, are made dependent on the bounty of their fellow-creatures,
    are not these creatures, as it were, put in the place of God, to take credit
    to themselves for paying obligations that you yourself say God owes?</p>
  <p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of
    vague injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an
    easy means for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches
    and communions to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are
    serving God. Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice
    to the teaching of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle

  <p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting

  <ul>
    <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve
      it, but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may
      do will be the danger of doing harm.</li>
    <li> Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the
      vice that is born of it breeds.</li>
    <li> Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
      of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for
      mere laborers, for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
    <li> Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are
      too many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
    <li> Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but
      drives further the class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodations
      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</li>
    <li> Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
      on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
    <li> Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
      are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
      reducing their wages.</li>
    <li> Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
      it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
      or partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he
      will do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
    <li> Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic
      times who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try
      to beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
      narrow and crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let
      him open tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful
      and attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not
      be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will
      it not be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of
      his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to landowners?
      Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things will
      start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
  <p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of
    God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JUSTICE in men's mouths is cringingly humble when she first begins a protest
    against a time-honored wrong, and we of the English-speaking nations still
    wear the collar of the Saxon thrall, and have been educated to look upon
    the "vested rights" of landowners with all the superstitious reverence that
    ancient Egyptians looked upon the crocodile. But when the times are ripe
    for them, ideas grow, even though insignificant in their first appearance.
    One day, the Third Estate covered their heads when the king put on his hat.
    A little while thereafter, and the head of a son of St. Louis rolled from
    the scaffold. The anti-slavery movement in the United States commenced with
    talk of compensating owners, but when four millions of slaves were emancipated,
    the owners got no compensation, nor did they clamor for any. And by the time
    the people of any such country as England or the United States are sufficiently
    aroused to the injustice and disadvantages of individual ownership of land
    to induce them to attempt its nationalization, they will be sufficiently
    aroused to nationalize it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase.
    They will not trouble themselves about compensating the proprietors of land. &#8212;<em> </em><em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>IT requires reflection to see that manifold effects result from a single
    cause, and that the remedy for a multitude of evils may lie in one simple
    reform. As in the infancy of medicine, men were disposed to think each distinct
    symptom called for a distinct remedy, so when thought begins to turn to social
    subjects there is a disposition to seek a special cure for every ill, or
    else (another form of the same short-sightedness) to imagine the only adequate
    remedy to be something which presupposes the absence of those ills; as, for
    instance, that all men should be good, as the cure for vice and crime; or
    that all men should be provided for by the State, as the cure for poverty. &#8212; <em>Protection

  <p>MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend to advance in proportion
    to the mental power expended in progression &#8212; the mental power which
    is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

            <br>
To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress through the water will not depend
upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted to propelling her.
This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for baling, or any
expenditure of force in fighting among themselves or in pulling in different
directions. <br>
            <br>
Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the first
essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater the possibilities
of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict becomes
greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an equality of rights
is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice) is the second essential of
progress. <br>
            <br>
Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees mental
power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law) prevents
the dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>THAT justice is the highest quality in the moral hierarchy I do not say;
    but that it is the first. That which is above justice must be based on justice,
    and include justice, and be reached through justice. It is not by accident
    that, in the Hebraic religious development which through Christianity we
    have inherited, the declaration, "The Lord thy God is a just God," precedes
    the sweeter revelation of a God of Love. Until the eternal justice is perceived,
    the eternal love must be hidden. As the individual must be just before he
    can be truly generous, so must human society be based upon justice before
    it can be based on benevolence. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp09.html">Social

It is, something grander than Benevolence, something more august than Charity &#8212; it
is Justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. Justice that will
not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice that with the scales carries
the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies and prayers? Shall we avert
the decrees of immutable law by raising churches when hungry infants moan and
weary mothers weep?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes to
the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that come
of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays on Him the
responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. We degrade the Everlasting.

WE see that God in His dealings with men has not been a bungler or a niggard;
that He has not brought too many men into the world; that He has not neglected
abundantly to supply them; that He has not intended that bitter competition of
the masses for a mere animal existence, and that monstrous aggregation of wealth
which characterizes our civilization; but that these evils, which lead so many
to say there is no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God's ordering,
are due to our denial of His moral law. We see that the law of justice, the law
of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the law of
social life. We see that, if we were only to observe it, there would be work
for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization would tend
to give to the poorest not only necessaries, but all comforts and reasonable
luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer when He told men
that, if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right doing, they might no
more worry about material things than do the lilies of the field about their
raiment; but that He was only declaring what political economy, in the light
of modern discovery, shows to be a sober truth. &#8212; <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

  <p><em>Q62. If the ownership of land is immoral is it not the duty of individuals
    who see its immorality to refrain from profiting by it?</em><br>
    A. No. The immorality is institutional, not individual. Every member of a
    community has a right to land and an interest in the rent of land. Under
    the single tax both rights would be conserved. But under existing social
    institutions the only way of securing either is to own land and profit by
    it. To refrain from doing so would have no reformatory effect. It is one
    of the eccentricities of narrow minds to believe or profess to believe that
    institutional wrongs and individual wrongs are upon the same plane and must
    be cured in the same way &#8212; by individual reformation. But individuals
    cannot change institutions by refraining from profiting by them, any more
    than they could dredge a creek by refraining from swimming in it. Institutional
    wrongs must be remedied by institutional reforms. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q46. Would it not be confiscation so to increase the tax on land?</em><br>
A. What would be confiscated? No land would be taken, no right of occupancy,
  or use, or improvement, or sale, or devise; nothing would be taken that is
  conveyed or guaranteed by the title deed.</p>
  <p><em>Q47. What is the distinction between taxation and confiscation?</em><br>
  A. The sovereign state may appropriate private property of its citizens in
    two ways: (1) by confiscation; (2) by taxation. When one particular man by
    treason or otherwise has forfeited his rights as a citizen, the land and
    houses and personalty of this one man may all be &quot;forfeit to the crown,&quot; while
    the validity and sanctity of 9,999 other men's rights are in no way infringed.
    This is confiscation. On the other hand, when the state, in order to obtain
    the revenue to meet the expenses of government, levies tribute upon its 10,000
    citizens impartially, this is taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q48. But would it not be an injustice to the landowner?</em><br>
  A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes (wages) to maintain an
    unearned income (net economic rent) that bears no tax burden, how can it
    be an injustice to stop doing so? There can be no injustice in taking for
    the benefit of the community the value that is created by the community.

think that the man who makes money by unearned increment in land is

finds it in this hard world under the law and according to common
usage. It is not the individual I attack, it is the system. <span

only to the future, and for the future we say only this, that the
community shall be the partner in any further increment above the
present value after all the owner's improvements have been deducted. We
say that the State and the municipality should jointly levy a toll upon
the future unearned increment of the land. The toll of what? Of the
whole? No. Of a half? No. Of a quarter! No. Of <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small><br>
<small>Apart from Free Trade, the great economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes now not as a
document of historic interest but as a challenge to politicians, indeed
to the entire electorate, to consider again the causes of poverty and
the basic issues of social and economic justice. Perhaps current
disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that if justice in
the community can only be achieved at the expense of individual
liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing taxation
and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of the individual are complementary and that
taxes may be raised without undermining either, The People's Rights
comes as a major contribution to current political and economic
thought. Indeed it deserves a place in the annals of Man's struggle for
freedom and yearning for a society in which the genius of every person
would be nurtured and the liberty of every person respected.&nbsp; </small><small>...

  <div align="left">I'm here today as a &quot;Single Taxer&quot;. If you don't
      recall quite what that is, let me first say that it&#8217;s NOT Steve Forbes&#8217;s &#8220;flat
      tax!&#8221; No. The Single Tax is actually a comprehensive program for
      economic justice and environmental sustainability. It was stated most memorably
      by
      the American economist Henry George in his 1879 book <em><a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress
      and Poverty</a></em> &#8212; and affirmed by a great many important thinkers,
      before and since. The idea is for society to collect the rental value of
      land for public revenue &#8212; and to abolish all other taxes on the production
      and exchange of wealth. It came to be known at the &#8220;Single Tax&#8221; because
      of this proposal that the rent of land should be the sole source of public
      revenue. </div>
  <p> Single Taxers have been ridiculed somewhat, over the years, for peddling

      words that we use so often that we tend to take their meanings for granted.
      It might be helpful to stop and think about what they truly mean.</p>
  <p> Justice is often seen as the fair retribution for something done wrong,
    as in &quot;justice was done&quot; when a criminal is sent to jail. George
    W. Bush vowed, for example, to bring the 9-11 terrorists to justice.</p>
  <p> However, that conception of justice &#8212; in which one does good, in order
    to avoid the consequences of not doing good &#8212; is actually an immature
    one. In the stages of moral development identified by psychologist Lawrence
    Kohlberg, this is called the conventional&quot; stage. Maturity comes
    in the &quot;post-conventional&quot; stage, when we come to value doing good
    so as to contribute to our community, or, even, doing good for its own sake.</p>
  <p> Jesus was hip to that, in his scorn for the loudly-praying pharisees on
    the street corners. They already have their reward, he said. He set much
    greater
    store by good deeds done without thought of reward: &quot;whatever you do to
    the least of my brothers and sisters, you to do me also.&quot; And, even more
    to the point, the prophet Micah enjoins us to &quot;Do justice and love mercy.&quot;</p>
  <p> So, what is &quot;doing justice,&quot; in this positive sense? If I do
    something nice for the least of my brothers and sisters, have I done justice?
    If I send
    them a handmade quilt?</p>
  <p> Not really. I think the least of my brothers and sisters, cold though they
    might be, would resent my presuming to know exactly how to handle their problem;
    perhaps they'd rather make their own quilt, or build a fireplace, or move to
    a warmer place.</p>
  <p> Justice must have to do with freedom. To do justice, then, is to secure,
    in Thomas Jefferson's words, people's inalienable rights: life, liberty and
    the pursuit of happiness.</p>
  <p> The most basic of those rights is life. (In this day and age, though, even
      that is controversial... There's a great deal of passionate contention
    about the troubling special cases of the very beginning, or the very end
    of life &#8212; but
      it seems to me that we ought to pay more attention to every single human
    being's right to live!) ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

  Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice
    and Economic Reform</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>No man is an Island
entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice. If
I tell you that I stand before you as justice, you know that across
my face you will find -- a blindfold. In my left hand I hold aloft -- a
pair of scales. You know that in my right hand I have -- a sword that I
will use if necessary. And my gender is female.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The blindfold, the scales, the
sword, and the feminine gender.
These features of the traditional symbol tell us much about justice.
The blindfold might seem out of place, since it prevents justice from
either seeing what the scales say or wielding the sword effectively.
But we know that the blindfold has a distinct and essential meaning.
The blindfold ensures that justice will not be swayed by any visible
characteristics of those who plead before her. Justice is not
concerned with whether you are black or white, short or tall,
beautiful or ugly. Every person receives the same treatment from
justice. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scales have at least two
possible interpretations. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And then the sword. The sword
represents the fact that justice is
prepared to use the threat of force, and force itself, to see that
her decrees are carried out. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus if we know that justice is
the blindfolded woman with the
scales and the sword, then we know that justice is the principles of
equality and evenhandedness that command and prohibit the use of
force in resolving conflicts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider what this tells us. It
tells us first that if we wish to
claim that justice authorizes the force we wish to use, or that
justice forbids the force that others wish to use against us, then we
must be able to show that our claim is consistent with equality and
evenhandedness.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Second, the blindfold tells us
that we are not in the realm of
justice if the principles we offer to explain why our use of force is
justified are of the form, "Because I am better than you," or
Hitler's, "Because Aryans are better than Jews." Justice compels us
to acknowledge the equality of all persons. Claims of individual or
group supremacy cannot be accepted by justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Third, not only are all persons
equal in the blindfolded eyes of
justice, but their different goals in life all deserve equal respect.
    <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Even the utilitarian proposal that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the conservative
claim that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a contractarian formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, this does not make
Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Rawls has proposed
that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes. .
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a bone-marrow
transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me,
then
what about a kidney? <strong>...</strong> </small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one
available
heart after I have had my share of years.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just as I own my kidneys, so do
I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Locke qualified his
statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;<strong>
...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental
problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities. <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Getting back to where we started,
is it true that, "If you want
peace-- real peace--you should work for justice?" and if so why?
Well, it's half true. To see why, consider what peace is, and how one
might create it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is unity and harmony. Peace
is people recognizing that we
are all parts of one another, that it is always for ourselves that
the bell tolls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What keeps us from attaining
peace? One of the greatest hindrances
to the attainment of peace -- real peace -- is that resistance that so
many of us feel to tolerating oppression and injustice. When we know
that we, or others we care for, have been treated unjustly, it is
ever so difficult to attain a state of unity and harmony with others.
The leap to peace is so much easier from a position of justice. So,
even though peace and justice are very disparate things, and peace is
much the more attractive one, still it make sense, if you want to
help people reach peace, to work for justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the reason that this is only
half true is that, in fact,
justice is not actually necessary to your attainment of peace. If you
want peace for yourself, you can have it, at any time, in any
circumstances in which you find yourself. Whether you are treated
justly or not, you are a part of the being that is all humanity. Each
person's joy is your joy. Each person's grief is your grief. You
don't have to wait until you are treated justly to see this.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But if you want peace for
yourself, simply have it.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<small>VIII. Conclusion</small><br>
<br>
<small>Humanity is emerging from eons of development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people think of preventing
grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_GEJaCGEJ.html"><span

<small>Dave Wetzel: <a href="../docs/Wetzel_Justice.html">Justice or
Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Wetzel_Justice.html">
</a>We all have our own personal interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Similarly, let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in the
natural wealth of the nation. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The essential and immutable
principles of justice used certainly
to be: -- </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That everyone had a right of
property in the hard-earned fruits of
his labour; that whatever property a man had made by the expenditure
of his capital, his industry and his toil, was really his own; that
he, and he alone, had a right to all the benefits, the advantages and
enjoyments that that property yielded; and that if anyone else
meddled with that property against his will, or interfered with him
in its enjoyment, he was thereby guilty of the crimes of theft and of
robbery, which the eternal law of God, as well as the laws of all
nations, reprobated and punished with such severity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the principles which underlie
the existing system of Land
Tenure, and which impart to it its specific and distinctive
character, are exactly the reverse of these. The principles on which
that system is based are: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That one privileged class do not
require to labour for their
livelihood at all: that they have an exclusive right to all the
advantages, comforts and enjoyments that can be derived from a
splendid property, which exacted no patient, painful or self-denying
efforts of labour to create it or acquire it, and which, in fact,
they inherited without any sacrifice at all: that, being a singularly
favoured race, and being all God's eldest sons, the rest of the world
must humbly acknowledge themselves to be their inferiors in rank,
lineage, condition and dignity: that this superiority of rank gives
them a right to sell out God's gifts as if they were purely the
products of their own labour and industry, and that they can exact in
exchange for them famine or scarcity prices. Finally, that they enjoy
the enviable privilege of appropriating the hard-earned property of
others against their wills, and do them no wrong even if they charge
them a rent for the use of what would really appear to be their
own....</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, any form of injustice,
oppression or wrong that can possibly
exist in any of the great trades or industries of a nation is only
felt by the individuals who belong to that industry or trade, and who
earn their livelihood by their labour and skill in it. Outside, in
the other greater or lesser of the national industries, it is hardly
felt at all. But the Irish system of Land Tenure wrongs and
impoverishes not only those who live by and of the land, but all
other classes in the community as well! It robs not only the
cultivators of the soil, but every man in the community, of a
substantial portion of the hard-earned fruits of his labour, no
matter in what trade or profession he may labour for his living. It
is, therefore, not a local or a particular grievance, but a great
national injustice, and that, I think, is its most objectionable
peculiarity.&nbsp;

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">How the Other Half Dies</span>,
Susan George wrote that "The most pressing cause of the abject poverty
which millions of people in this world endure is that a mere 2.5% of
landowners with more than 100 hectares control nearly three quarters of
all the land in the world - with the top 0.23% controlling half." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To recognize this social plague for what it
is, and to avert a backlash of despair, requires a clear understanding
of two great themes: the Promised Land and the Wasteland.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Promised Land is the hope
of the
landless, literally, land, the gateway to opportunity.</span> Abraham
in Mesopotamia and the Israelites in bondage in Egypt so wished for
their own land that they left homes and familiar surroundings and
risked death to seek the distant place God had promised, a land rich in
milk and honey, where a day's labor would put food on the table and
allow their children to grow into adulthood. This exodus pattern has
been repeated over and over, from the migrations of prehistory to the
boat people of our day. For centuries, immigrants have poured into the
Americas, looking for the inheritance denied to them in the Old World
-- their portion of land.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the Promised Land is not so
much a geographic place as it is a hope
and a vision of a just social order. </span>Modern society has many
wondrous
features, but it certainly is not the Promised Land in its full glory.
Indeed, we are "modern captives" who sense the Promised Land as a
primitive instinct, as a deep longing, and as a cry from the depths of
our captivity that the world should be different.</small><br>
<br>
<small>All of us, no less than the Hebrews in Egypt, are captives of
structures imposed upon us. To enslave people, today as three thousand
years ago, is to rob them of the value of their labor. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Millions of working people living
in severe poverty are robbed of the fruits of their labor.</span>
Through various forms of exploitation, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">especially the monopolization of land
rights</span>, large segments of humanity are oppressed, dehumanized,
held in bondage. <span style="font-weight: bold;">One factor enabling
governments to legalize land theft and lend respectability to
exploitative landlordism is the general silence of religious and
intellectual leaders about humanity's common rights to land.</span> <strong>...
</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Some defenders of the status quo admit
that all land titles may be traced either to acts of force or fraud (or
to the more respectable-sounding "priority of occupation"). But, they
add, we cannot start over; society has for centuries given legal
sanction to private landed property. Innumerable contracts have been
executed on the basis of this sanction, and these include the good
faith purchase of land. For society to withdraw this sanction, they
claim, would be a breach of trust.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
passage of time, however, cannot turn a wrong into a right.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Kings and popes and governments
never had the moral right to vest in perpetual ownership what God
intended for the benefit of all. </span>If the acquisition of a
benefit under the law were to establish such a vested right, no law
could ever be amended, since it would invariably work to someone's
disadvantage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Obviously, change that further rends the fabric of society is
usually
self-defeating. And the vast majority of beneficiaries of unjust
structures -- the beleagured middle classes -- are not intentional
wrongdoers but passive recipients of unearned wealth from a flawed
system they did not create. The dismantling of these structures,
therefore, should, whenever possible, be done in ways that avoid
excessive hardship for them. But it must be done.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>By equalizing opportunity, political and economic liberation
tend to draw both poor and rich into the middle class. As an expression
of social justice, this constitutes a genuine advance, ethical as well
as material. But it is no easy guarantee of spiritual gain.
Middle-class traits include virtues such as industry, thrift,
restraint, commercial and professional rectitude, but, on the other
hand, low prudentialism, self-satisfaction, and an inclination to
regard material well-being as a sign of righteousness. Hence, even in
the Promised Land, what Paulo Freire calls "conscientization" (roughly,
consciousness-raising through social commitment), emphasized and
refined by liberation theology, must continue although in a different
vein. The Kingdom of God will flourish only when outward liberation
gives rise to inward liberation, a victory over the limitations of the
bourgeois ethos.</small><br>
<br>
<small>"The Earth Is the Lord's" (Psalm 24:1). This statement tells us
something about God. He is attached to the land and loves it. He is not
a spiritual abstraction oblivious to the Wasteland in which we live.
God is the maker of the world of eating and sleeping, working and
begetting. It also tells us something of our place in this world. With
God as the true owner of the earth, every person has a right to the
produce which equitable usufruct yields to his or her efforts.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
same God who established communities has also in his providence
ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
have a corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a
well-nigh universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more
sinful than are people at large, except to the degree that they
knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation.
Many abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system,
it is better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
does. The profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially
desirable as well as in ways that are socially destructive. Let us give
testimony to our faith that the earth is the Lord's by building a
social order in which there are no victims. </small><small><a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Charity can only palliate
present suffering a little at the risk
of fatal disease. For charity cannot right a wrong; only justice can
do that. Charity is false, futile, and poisonous when offered as a
substitute for justice. This is the fatal taint that runs through all
the efforts of the rich and influential to aid the unemployed, with
which our newspapers now are full. Like the gatherings of clergymen
called in Chicago by Editor Stead -- blinded leader of the wilfully
blind -- their spirit is that of men pretending to look for what they
are determined not to find; of men, like those of Moscow of whom
Tolstoi tells, willing to do anything whatever to help the poor --
except to get off their backs. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet this is to be expected. For
the question of the unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What that injustice is may be seen
by whoever will really look. We
have only to ask to find. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</span></small><br>
<small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it."&nbsp;
