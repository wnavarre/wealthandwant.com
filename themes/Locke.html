      the law of Nature,&#8221; says John Locke, &#8220;the offender declares himself to
      live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which is
      that measure God has set to the actions of men for their mutual
      security, and so he becomes dangerous to mankind; the tie which is to
      secure them from injury and violence being slighted and broken by him,
      which being a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and
      safety of it, provided for by the law of Nature, every man upon this
      score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general, may
      restrain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and
      so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgressed that law, as
      may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and, by his
      example, others from doing the like mischief. And in this case, and
      upon this ground, every man hath a right to punish the offender, and be

      Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
    Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke is often
      misrepresented by royal libertarians, who
      quote him very selectively. For example, Locke did say that:</small></div>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>Whatsoever then he
      removes out of the state that nature
      hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and
      joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
      property.</i></small></blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But Locke condemned anyone who
      took more than he needed as a
"spoiler of the commons":</small></p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>...if the fruits rotted, or
      the venison putrified,
      before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature,
      and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he
      had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they
      might serve to afford him conveniences of life. </i></small></div>
        <small> </small>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>The same measures governed
      the possession of land too:
      whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it
      spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could
      feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if
      either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of
      his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of
      the earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as
      waste, and might be the possession of any other. </i></small></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke also restricted
      appropriation of land by the proviso,
      ignored by royal libertarians, that there must be still enough, and
      as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in
      effect, there was never the less left for others because of his
      enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make
      use of, does as good as take nothing at all.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now if the situation is that there
      is enough free land, and as
      good, left after you take and cultivate your land, than your land has
      no market value, for who would pay you for land that is not better
      than land that can be had for free? So, besides the fact that Locke's
      justification of privatizing land is far more limited than royal
      libertarians portray it to be, it is irrelevant to the question of
      land value tax, as it applies only to land that has no value.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, Locke based
      his
      scenario on pre-monetary societies,
      where a landholder would find that "it was useless, as well as
      dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed."
      With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became
      appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land
      than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as
      between them they will have taken all the land, and others will
      have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the
      Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to
      Locke.</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And while Locke did not propose a
      remedy specifically for to this
      problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real
      estate.

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rutgers Professor of Urban
      Planning Donald Krueckeberg more
      recently explained how real property became for the first time a
"commodity," much as the market gives personal property exchange
      value. Native Americans tied the concept of property not to ownership
      but to use. "One used it, one moved on, and use was shared with
      others." But the colonists took their notion of real property from
      evolving British legal tradition, defined largely in terms of what
      its owners could subdue and control against challengers. John Locke's
      conception of property was, in one sense, more akin to the Indian
      notion in as much as one owned it only to the extent that one "mixed
      one's labor" with it.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

      Justice
      and Economic Reform</a></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the
      classical liberal conception of justice
      are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
      issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
      natural opportunities to be established?</small>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his statement
      that we own what we produce
      with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
      common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
      the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
      are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
      the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
      there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span>
      Locke does not address
      the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</small></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One tradition in classical
      liberalism concerning claims to land is
      that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
      as exemplified by Murray
      Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
      Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
      appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
      are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
      as inspired if not
      exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
      opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
      that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
      for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
      he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any
      excess in one's claim
      generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
      George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
      nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
      and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
      have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
      generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
      fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental problems
      with the position of
      homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
      incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
      environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
      those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
      backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
      displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
      violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
      without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
      who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
      practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
      the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
      fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
      rectified.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
      with the position of the
      homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
      unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
      ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
      allocating land.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
      thing, as people stampeded to do
      whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
      decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
      necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
      libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
      because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
      scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
      get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
      natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
      practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
      complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
      another lecture.)</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice is thus a regime in which
      persons have the greatest
      possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
      share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
      reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
      acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
      that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
      opportunities. </small><small>...</small> <small><small>&nbsp; <big><a

    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">The idea that natural opportunities are everyone's common heritage is often
          defended with religious language. John Locke said:</div>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Whether we consider natural reason, which tells us that men, being
          once born, have a right to their preservation, and consequently to meat and
          drink, and such other things as nature affords for their sustenance, or revelation,
          which gives us an account of those grants God made of the world to Adam, and
          to Noah, and his sons, 'tis very clear that God, as King David says, Psal.
          CXV. xvi. has given the Earth to the children of men, given it to mankind in
          common.<font
 size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">John Locke did not advocate land value taxation. Writing in about 1690, he
          said that there was so much unclaimed land in America that no one could properly
          complain about the private appropriation of land in Europe.<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font> Writing
          nearly 200 year later, when it was becoming impossible for people to appropriate
          good unclaimed land in America, Henry George said: </div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator, we are
          all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty -- with an equal
          right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
          which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human
          being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance in the world
          can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
          thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
          make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
          to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
          who follow them.<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">George preceded this argument with a psychological and linguistic one. He
          said that our conception of property, of a right of exclusive possession, is
          based on the idea that each person has a right to his or her productive powers,
          and therefore to what he or she produces. Since no one produced land, no one
          can properly claim to own it.<font size="-1"><b><i>5</i></b></font> ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read

      <p>Three hundred years ago virtually no one questioned the propriety of

        invested
          in slaves. But over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
          amid extreme controversy in some times and places, slavery was nearly
        eliminated from the world. With a bit of a lag, a consensus gradually
        evolved among
          humanity that slavery was wrong, indeed that no distinctions in civil
        rights based on race
    could be justified. </p>

      <p>Two hundred years ago almost no one thought that women should be allowed
          to vote. Amid extreme controversy in some times and places, they were granted
          voting rights. Now virtually no one argues that women should be denied
          any rights that men have. We have not yet arrived at a consensus about
          what equality of the sexes means, but we are near a consensus that we should
        strive for it. ... </p>

      Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>One of the factors that makes the case for secession difficult is the
          problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the people who
          called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria in the 1960s,
          the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact that, if they had
          succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate oil resources from the
          rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the efforts of the Chechins
          to separate from Russia is explained in part by the understanding that,
          even though the Chechins have been abused by Russians for centuries and
          have never fully acceded to their incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya
          were allowed to separate from Russia, that would create a precedent that
          would make it difficult to oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely
          populated Yakutsia region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds,
          to insist that they too have a right to be a separate nation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Perhaps, a general recognition of a right of secession will need to wait
          for another component of moral evolution: a recognition that all persons
          have equal claims on the value of natural opportunities. If this were recognized,
          then any nation or region with disproportionately great natural resources
          would be seen to have an obligation to share the value from using those
          resources with those parts of the world that have less than average resources
          per capita. This would eliminate the desire to appropriate natural resources
          as a reason for secession and as a reason for opposing secession. Signs
          of a recognition of the equal claims of all persons on the use of natural
          opportunities are slim. One can point to John Locke: </div>

              right he contended came about when an individual mixed his labor
              with the land.
              But Locke, in his famous &#8220;proviso,&#8221; stipulated that

          <blockquote>
            <p>In the seventeenth century, John Locke sought to balance the commons
              and private property. Like others of his era, he saw that private
              property doesn&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; it exists in relationship
              to a commons, vis-&agrave;-vis which there are takings and leavings.
              The rationale for private property is that it boosts economic production,
              but the commons has a rationale, too: it provides sustenance for
            all. Both sides must be respected.</p>
            <p>Locke believed that God gave the earth to &#8220;mankind in common,&#8221; but
              that private property is justified because it spurs humans to work.
              Whenever a person mixes his labor with nature, he &#8220;joins
              to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.&#8221; But
              here Locke added an important proviso: &#8220;For this labor being
              the unquestionable property of the laborer,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;no
              man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at
              least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.&#8221; In
              other words, a person can acquire property, but there&#8217;s a
              limit to how much he or she can rightfully appropriate. That limit
              is set by two considerations: first, it should be no more than
              he can join his labor to, and second, it has to leave &#8220;enough
              and as good&#8221; in common for others. This was consistent with
              English common law at the time, which held, for example, that a
              riparian landowner could withdraw water for his own use, but couldn&#8217;t
              diminish the supply available to others.</p>
            <p>Despite Locke&#8217;s quest for balance, the English commons didn&#8217;t
              last. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the movement
              to enclose and privatize it accelerated greatly. According to historian
              Karl Polanyi, this enclosure was the great transformation that
              launched the modern era. Local gentry, backed by Parliament, fenced
              off village lands and converted them to private holdings. Impoverished
              peasants then drifted to cities and became industrial workers.
              Landlords invested their agricultural profits in manufacturing,
              and modern times, economically speaking, began. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

          <blockquote>
            <p>Organizing Principles of the Commons Sector</p>
            <p>Property rights, especially the common kind, require competent
              institutions to manage them. What we need today, then, along with
              more common property, is a set of institutions, distinct from corporations
              and government, whose unique and explicit mission is to manage
              common property.</p>
            <p>I say set of institutions because there will and should be variety.
              The commons sector should not be a monoculture like the corporate
              sector. Each institution should be appropriate to its particular
              asset and locale.</p>
            <p>Some of the variety will depend on whether the underlying asset
              is limited or inexhaustible. Typically, gifts of nature have limited
              capacities; the air can safely absorb only so much carbon dioxide,
              the oceans only so many drift nets. Institutions that manage natural
              assets must therefore be capable of limiting use. By contrast,
              ideas and cultural creations have endless potential for elaboration
              and reuse. In these commons, managing institutions should maximize
              public access and minimize private tollbooths.</p>
            <p>Despite their variations, commons sector institutions would share
              a set of organizing principles. Here are the main ones.</p>
            <p><strong><font size="-1">LEAVE ENOUGH AND AS GOOD IN COMMON</font></strong></p>
            <p>As Locke argued, it&#8217;s okay to privatize parts of the commons
              as long as &#8220;enough and as good&#8221; is left for everyone
              forever. Enough in the case of an ecosystem means enough to keep
              it alive and healthy. That much, or more, should be part of the
              commons, even if parts of the ecosystem are private. In the case
              of culture and science, enough means enough to assure a vibrant
              public domain. Exclusive licenses, such as patents and copyrights,
              should be kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p><strong><font size="-1">PUT FUTURE GENERATIONS FIRST</font></strong></p>
            <p>Corporations put the interests of stockholders first, while government
              puts the interests of campaign donors and living voters first.
              No one at the moment puts future generations first. That&#8217;s
              Job Number One for the commons sector.</p>
            <p>In practice, this means trustees of common property should be
              legally accountable to future generations. (We&#8217;ll see how
              this might work in chapter 6.) They should also be bound by the
              precautionary principle: when in doubt, err on the side of safety.
              And when faced with a conflict between short-term gain and long-term
              preservation, they should be required to choose the latter.</p>
            <p><strong><font size="-1">THE MORE THE MERRIER</font></strong></p>
            <p>Whereas private property is inherently exclusive, common property
              strives to be inclusive. It always wants more co-owners or participants,
              consistent with preservation of the asset.</p>
            <p>This organizing principle applies most clearly to commons like
              culture and the Internet, where physical limits are absent and
              increasing use unleashes synergies galore. It also applies to social
              compacts like Social Security and Medicare, which require universal
              participation. In these compacts, financial mechanisms express
              our solidarity with other members of our national community. They&#8217;re
              efficient and fair because they include everybody. Were they to
              operate under profit-maximizing principles, they&#8217;d inevitably
              exclude the poor (who couldn&#8217;t afford to participate) and
              anyone deemed by private insurers to be too risky.</p>
            <p><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></p>
            <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one
              person, one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would
              be grounded on the principle of one person, one share. In the case
              of scarce natural assets, it will be necessary to distinguish between
              usage rights and income rights. It&#8217;s impossible for everyone
              to use a limited commons equally, but everyone should receive equal
              shares of the income derived from selling limited usage rights.</p>
            <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
              Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the
                privilege of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent
                Fund shows, it&#8217;s possible for common property co-owners
            to receive income too.</p>
            <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not
              only on liquidity, but also on attention. People would notice common
              property if they got income from it. They&#8217;d care about it,
              think about it, and talk about it. Concern for invisible commons
              would soar.</p>
            <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though.
              Since common property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t
              be tradeable the way corporate shares are. This means commons owners
              wouldn&#8217;t reap capital gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain
              their shared income stakes throughout their lives, and through
              such stakes, share in rent, royalties, interest, and dividends.

          3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Idea of Birthrights</p>
            <p>John Locke&#8217;s response to royalty&#8217;s claim of divine
              right was the idea of everyone&#8217;s inherent right to life,
              liberty, and property. Thomas Jefferson, in drafting America&#8217;s
              Declaration of Independence, changed Locke&#8217;s trinity to life,
              liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These, Jefferson and his
              collaborators agreed, are gifts from the creator that can&#8217;t
              be taken away. Put slightly differently, they&#8217;re universal
              birthrights.</p>
            <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant
              bones. They guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process,
              habeas corpus, speedy public trials, and secure homes and property.
              Wisely, the Ninth Amendment affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration
              in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed
              to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#8221; In that
              spirit, others have since been added.</p>
            <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
              see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against
              the state. The second included rights against unequal treatment
              based on race, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation. The
              third wave &#8212; which, historically speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists
              of rights not against things, but for things &#8212; free public
              education, collective bargaining for wages, security in old age.
              They can be thought of as rights necessary for the pursuit of happiness.</p>
            <p>What makes this latest wave of birthrights strengthen community
              is their universality. If some Americans could enjoy free public
              education while others couldn&#8217;t, the resulting inequities
              would divide rather than unite us as a nation. The universality
              of these rights puts everyone in the same boat. It spreads risk,
              responsibility, opportunity, and reward across race, gender, economic
              classes, and generations. It makes us a nation rather than a collection
              of isolated individuals.</p>
            <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from
              the corporate sector. The starting condition for the corporate
              sector, as we&#8217;ve seen, is that the top 5 percent owns more
              shares than everyone else. The starting condition for the commons
              sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
            <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights
              is that, while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are
              too expensive. They impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that
              is, on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore,
              to let everyone &#8212; including poor children and the sick &#8212; fend
              for themselves. In fact, the opposite is often true: universal
              birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper and more efficient
              than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always fairer.</p>
            <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights
              is anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where,
              economically speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great
              difficulty, we could add three birthrights to our economic operating
              system: one would pay everyone a regular dividend, the second would
              give every child a start-up stake, and the third would reduce and
              share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights or not isn&#8217;t
              a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
            <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We
              think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to give people &#8220;something
              for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations take common
              wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor and
              the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
              that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t
              make ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
              of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
              some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current
              distribution of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all,
              but rigged from the get-go by maldistributed property.</p>
            <p>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers,
              distinguished between pre distribution of property and re distribution
              of income. Under income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and
              transferred to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t
              popular with winners, who tend to control government and the media.
              Under property pre distribution, by contrast, the playing field
              is leveled by spreading property ownership before income is generated.
              After that, there&#8217;s no need for income redistribution; property
              itself distributes income to all. According to Rawls, while income
              re distribution creates dependency, property predistribution empowers.</p>
            <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property
              from some and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth
              that already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing)
              some of that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
            <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons,
              we need to propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth
              now. This twenty-first century necessity means we have a chance
              to save the planet, and as a bonus, add a universal birthright.

          <blockquote>
            <p><br>
              The Statute of Queen Anne, passed by the English Parliament in
                1710, gave authors, not printers, title to their works. Such
                title was in the form of an exclusive right for fourteen years,
                with an option to renew for the same period. Thereafter, works
                would enter what we now call the public domain, and anyone could
                reprint them without further compensating the author. The idea
                was to reward authors sufficiently to induce them to write, but
                once they&#8217;d been fairly paid, to have literature circulate
            as widely and as cheaply as possible.</p>
            <p>A leading advocate of this new arrangement was John Locke. As
              with landed property, Locke sought to balance the interest of the
              laborer who adds value with that of the commons that stores and
              shares value. In a memorandum to Parliament, he argued that it
              was &#8220;unreasonable and injurious to learning&#8221; to grant
              exclusive rights to print classic texts; the &#8220;liberty, to
              any one, of printing them, is certainly the way to have them the
              cheaper and the better.&#8221; As for &#8220;authors that now live
              and write,&#8221; he proposed &#8220;to limit their property to
              a certain number of years after . . . the first printing of the
              book.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In this spirit, the U.S. Constitution gave Congress authority &#8220;to
              promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
              limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
              respective Writings and Discoveries.&#8221; Shortly thereafter,
              in 1790, the first American copyright law gave authors the same
              deal as in Britain: exclusive rights for fourteen years, with an
              option to renew for another fourteen. After that, their work entered
              the public domain. The idea wasn&#8217;t so much to expand intellectual
              property rights as to set boundaries on them. Indeed, what we call
              intellectual property today was then considered a monopoly privilege
              granted by the state, not a right belonging to a creator.</p>
            <p>For nearly two centuries, this arrangement worked brilliantly.
              There was no lack of creativity on either side of the Atlantic.
              But starting about thirty years ago, large entertainment companies
              began tipping the balance from the public domain to the private.
              Led by the Walt Disney Company, the corporations pushed Congress
              to extend copyright terms, first to seventy-five years and then
              to ninety-five. (The extensions occurred whenever Mickey Mouse
              was about to enter the public domain.) One consequence is that
              the public domain has been marginalized; corporations now take
              from the commons and give nothing back. Another is that the experience
              of culture has been altered; we&#8217;re now consumers of culture
              rather than participants. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
