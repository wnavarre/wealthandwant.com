    Reform</span>    </div>
  <p><br>
    What passes today for discussion of "tax reform" is really quite
  narrow.&nbsp; Most of it is confined to a very small box -- the income
  tax box -- and could reasonably be compared to rearranging the deck
  chairs on the Titanic in order to get a better view of the musicians.
    The income tax box is a small box, and it is the wrong box.&nbsp; Income
  taxes take from workers that which they worked to create!  We have to get outside
    that box.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A national sales tax is clearly not the answer.&nbsp; Different box, but
    still the wrong box. We need to get outside that one, too</p>
  <p>After we've looked at all the illogical proposals, I hope we'll move toward
    the one that is logical and just and will promote widespread prosperity:
    land value taxation. If we begin collecting the annual value of land, in
    all its forms, and the revenue is insufficient to supply all our revenue
    needs, then we may need to rely on sales taxes or income taxes, or estate
    taxes (which today are one of the few ways to capture a portion of the appreciation
    of land, but only from the top 2% of the population).<br>

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. tax system is widely perceived as too complex, too intrusive, and
      too demanding of workers&#8217; paychecks. Taxes today claim a greater share
      of the average family&#8217;s budget than food, clothing, housing, and
      transportation combined.1 In 2005, the average American had to work 107
      days just to pay taxes,
      compared to 44 days in 1930.2</p>
  <p>Tax reform proposals, not surprisingly, are popular among voters and the politicians
      who represent them. President George W. Bush created an advisory panel on tax
      reform. Some economists and institutes have proposed reforms to flatten and
      simplify the income tax, or to replace it entirely with a national sales or
      consumption tax or value-added tax.</p>
  <p>These would be an improvement, but if we seek to reform taxes, we should
    consider all the possibilities and choose, as <a href="Friedman.html">Milton
    Friedman</a> puts it, the &#8220;least
      bad&#8221; tax. ... </p>
  <p>... This might seem too good to be true, but in fact, such a resource exists
      everywhere and is indispensable for human action. That resource is land.
    The supply is
      fixed, immobile, and inherently visible. If land value is taxed, the land
    will not flee, shrink, or hide. A tax on land value has no deadweight loss.
    If the
      purpose of tax reform is to reduce the extra costs imposed on the economy,
      a tax on land value does this
    far better than any tax on income or goods. ...</p>
  <p>...The use of land value or land rent for public revenue thus has
            proponents today, but their voices have not been widely heard in the
            debate over tax reform, and there are also opponents. The purpose of
            this report is to give greater voice to land value taxation and to
            better inform those interested in tax reform about this alternative.
    We can best judge among options when we consider the whole range of
        possibilities. ...</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An idea widely held,
        yet little known!<br>
    <br>
    </span>Land value taxation is often ignored in policy discussions. For example,
    the publication <span style="font-style: italic;">Towards
    Fundamental Tax Reform</span>, analyzing various proposals to reform the
    U.S. tax system, discusses taxes on income, sales, and value added.
    The editors recognize &#8220;Government should seek to raise sufficient funds
    to finance the desired level of spending in a manner that does the least amount
    of damage possible, while distributing the tax burden
    equitably.&#8221;21 Yet the book has no mention of taxes on land value or
    rent, even though, as argued in this study, land value taxation best fits
    those criteria
    and resolves the alleged trade-off between
    efficiency and equity. ...</p>
  <p>Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware of
      the substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed, is often
      why such reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to discourage borrowing,
      reduce consumption, or encourage savings, for example. But moving to a national
      retail sales tax results in little
    improvement.<br>
    <br>
    Most people use their wage income to pay for goods and services and sales taxes.
    Switching from an income to a sales tax is like taxing you when you leave a room
    instead of when you enter the room.<br>
    <br>
    Income taxes punish savings, but sales taxes punish borrowing. If you borrow
    $10,000 to buy a car and there is a 20 percent sales tax, you need to borrow
    an extra $2,000 to pay the tax. Some folks might decide to not buy the car, spending
    the $10,000 on something else, without
    borrowing $2,000....</p>
  <p>... Even if land value taxation does not yield the revenue that is desired,
    this is no argument against shifting as much public revenue as possible
    to rent-based sources. Public revenue from land values is the most
    complete application of &#8220;supply-side&#8221; economic policy. Supply-side
    policy attempts to increase production and the supply of goods by decreasing
    costs, such as by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive regulations and
    barriers to trade. A complete tax shift, away from taxing production to taxing
    land values,
    is the ultimate supply-side policy, since it removes the excess economic
    burden of taxation. The
    public collection of land rent is thus the ultimate in tax reform.<br>
    <br>
    Land value taxation would also result in a substantial reduction in the cost
    of government. The administrative cost of land value taxes would be less
    than that of existing property taxes (which require a greater inspection
    of buildings
    and improvements), and the cost of enforcing income and sales taxes would
    be eliminated. By improving economic growth and allowing workers to keep
    all the
    money they earn, land value taxation would result in higher incomes, reducing
    the demand for government welfare programs. Decentralization, privatization,
    and the elimination of wasteful government programs would further reduce
    the amount needed to fund government. ...</p>
  <p>Critics of land value taxation claim that over time, there would be popular
      pressure to bring back the income and sales taxes. It is true that those owning
      valuable commercial land will always seek to lower the tax on land and shift
      taxes to labor and capital. It is also true that governments can ignore constitutional
      rules, and governments get overthrown. By this argument, the slaves should
      never have been freed, because slavery can always be restored. Women should
      not have been given the opportunity to vote, because that could be reversed.
      This is an argument against any reform and indeed against any action to improve
      your condition. (Why bother to work? You might lose your money, and it will
      have been for nothing.) This is ultimately a philosophical argument for the
      futility of any human action. </p>
  <p>But the fact is that there was a shift in public attitude about slavery,
    and most folks now believe it was morally wrong. It would be politically
    difficult
      today to reverse the equal rights of women to vote. Similarly, once there
    is a shift in public attitudes about taxing wages, the view that it is morally
      wrong to tax labor could be just as
    irreversible. ...</p>
  <p>Imagine the increased prosperity and opportunities for advancement that would
      exist if people could keep all of the money they earn; if billions of dollars
      wasted on efforts to avoid high income taxes were suddenly turned to productive
      endeavors; and if the growth of government were constrained by a tax system
      that would raise only
    enough to pay for services actually provided. <br>
    <br>
    Land value taxation is central to the political philosophy of the founding
    fathers of the United States. Far from being a new idea, or the idea of a
    small group
    of thinkers, it is a concept embraced by many of the most important figures
    from our history: John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson,
    and today,<a href="Friedman.html"> Milton Friedman</a>. Land value
    taxation is part of America&#8217;s proud and distinguished tradition of political
    philosophy. Surely it belongs in the national debate over how best to reform
    the nation&#8217;s tax system.<br>
    <br>
    The shift from taxing productive human action to collecting the economic
    rent generated by nature and communities is more than a fiscal reform. There
    is a
    philosophical and even spiritual side to this reform. ...</p>
  <p>Public revenue from land rent is a necessary element of true free trade and
      a genuinely free market. Even a small and flat income tax, sales tax, or tariff
      grants government the power to intrude into transactions, adding friction that
      reduces the flexibility of an economy. The elimination of this friction and
      deadweight loss is made
    possible by land value taxation.<br>
    <br>
    The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system benefits
    certain vested interests that will resist reform. But since the public at
    large will benefit from a shift to land value taxation, and since they greatly
    outnumber
    those obtaining privileges from the current system, the greater reason why
    this tax reform has not taken place is that the public has not been informed.
    Once
    citizens, taxpayers, consumers, and voters understand the option of obtaining
    public revenue from land value or rent, then the logic of getting both greater
    efficiency and greater justice may well prevail. ...</p>
  <p>... An ideal public revenue policy respects a person&#8217;s right to privacy,
    does not discourage work or savings, and does not induce dishonesty. While
    income, sales, and value-added taxes fall woefully short of this ideal, land
    value taxation meets each requirement.</p>
  <p>Imagine the increased prosperity and opportunities for advancement that
    would exist if people could keep all of the money they earn; if billions
    of dollars wasted on efforts to avoid high income taxes were suddenly turned
    to productive endeavors; and if the growth of government were constrained
    by a tax system that would raise only enough to pay for services actually
    provided.<br>

  <p>The shift from taxing productive human action to collecting the economic
    rent generated by nature and communities is more than a fiscal reform. There
    is a philosophical and even spiritual side to this reform.</p>
  <p>One of the ongoing problems of social philosophy is the relationship of
    the individual to society. In conventional tax policy, there is an inherent
    conflict between the individual and government as the agent of society. Individuals
    want to benefit from the collective services provided by government, but
    the mechanisms for financing those services typically have used force against
    individuals and invaded their private lives.</p>
  <p>The collection of land rent for public revenue reconciles the individual
    and the community. The community and its government no longer intrude into
    the individual&#8217;s private life and stifle his or her pursuit of economic
    well being. The tax on land value is not a tax in substance, but only in
    the form of payments to government. In substance, the payment is a sharing
    of the benefits provided by community and nature, and a payment for the services
    that generate the value of the land. If this payment is not made by the landholder,
    the services become a subsidy, producing a value not returned to the community.</p>
  <p>The public collection of land rent can induce an efficient use of land.
    Land value taxation gives land a &#8220;carrying cost,&#8221; inducing title
    holders to put their land to its most productive current use, rather than
    hold it awaiting higher prices. With the price of land thus kept low, banks
    would lend for productive investments rather than to buy land.</p>
  <p>Public revenue from land rent is a necessary element of true free trade
    and a genuinely free market. Even a small and flat income tax, sales tax,
    or tariff grants government the power to intrude into transactions, adding
    friction that reduces the flexibility of an economy. The elimination of this
    friction and deadweight loss is made possible by land value taxation.</p>
  <p>The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system benefits
    certain vested interests that will resist reform. But since the public at
    large will benefit from a shift to land value taxation, and since they greatly
    outnumber those obtaining privileges from the current system, the greater
    reason why this tax reform has not taken place is that the public has not
    been informed. Once citizens, taxpayers, consumers, and voters understand

reform should be preceded by a discussion of what constitutes a good
system of taxing and spending. When principles of good taxing and

reliance on local decision-making and, for federal revenue, an

Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ideas we espouse are
attractive not only for their embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in which our ideas
promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful....&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The use of rent for public revenues therefore has no excess burden, no
burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
land rather than raise it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal
source of
general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.
Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
other forms of land. There could also be user fees for services
specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
enterprises.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from
minerals,
water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
circumstances.&nbsp; ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small> The public and community collection of rent puts
land at its most productive use, maximizing the wages of workers while
minimizing sprawl as well as boom/bust cycles. We need to understand
rent to fully understand the market process and the cause and remedy of
many of today's social problems.&nbsp;</small>

<small>We utilize less than 5% of the total land area in the United
States for urban purposes, including housing, commerce, and
manufacturing. As you fly across the country all you see is farm,
timber, desert and an occasional small community. While less than 5%
of our nation's land area is needed for urban purposes, much vacant
land within existing cities is bypassed because it is cheaper to
build further out than pay the high prices demanded for the more
efficient, better located, land. The result is urban sprawl. </small></div>

the density of land use. In many cities only one half of the land is
devoted to housing and commercial uses while the other half is vacant
or under-improved. Could it be that there are inefficient
requirements built into some public policies? Smart growth should not
be constrained by archaic patterns that impede or misappropriate free
and open urban land usage. Local ordinances and practices within
cities that force accelerated suburban sprawl should be abolished. We
don't need more regulation, we need greater freedom to act
responsibly. Individuals should have the opportunity to decide
whether they want to live in the suburbs or in the city. This should
not be a coerced decision because of a public policy that impedes
growth within the city. Simple tax reform can help to achieve some of
the goals and objectives of smart growth without government
intervention and wasteful subsidies.... <a

  <div align="left"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
  conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
  economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
  demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
  necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
  ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
  land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
  the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
  increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
  especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
  extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
  goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
  operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
  example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
  years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
  Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
  be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage, "Idle lands cause idle hands" is
  clearly demonstrated in Australia ... and elsewhere.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
only possible "winners" in this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is
now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum
is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays." How big is this periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented -
would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded! ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented by
    the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on wages and
    on interest
      by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income; it is income that
      arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation; it comes about as
      a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is ample moral warrant
      for society to lay claim to that which it has created, as well as to that which
      no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly makes clear that economic
      rent in all its forms is far larger than official government figures indicate;
      in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant all current taxes on labor and
      capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged to have so many negative
      effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations by taxing its various
      bases actually can foster economic performance and yield other benefits that
      make it the natural source of revenue for governments. Such a tax is essentially
      painless. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most of the literature on
taxation, in textbooks and articles, is
confined to studying existing forms of taxes, namely income, payroll,
sales, excise, tariff, value-added, estate and property taxes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Consider the article by David Altig <span
 style="font-style: italic;">et al </span>in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">American Economic Review</span>
(2001) entitled "Simulating Fundamental Tax Reform in the United
States." The authors examine "fundamental alternatives" to the U.S.
federal income tax. "Fundamental", they explain, means "the
simplification and integration of the tax code by eliminating tax
preferences and taxing all sources of capital income at the same rate"
(574). It is important to analyze such reforms, but the reforms
simulated are not what I would call fundamental. They are only a
restructuring of the existing income-tax code.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here, I plead for more attention to truly fundamental reform.
The idea
is to tax the market value of land, exclusive of the value of
improvements.</small>
