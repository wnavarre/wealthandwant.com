  <p>After his book, <em>Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig
      Our Tax System to
  Benefit the Super Rich &#8212; and Cheat Everybody Else, </em>was published,
  David Cay Johnston, who covers federal tax issues for the New York Times, said
  the following
  in an
  interview: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After finishing the book, I got off a plane and shared a taxi with a former
        state senator who is personally very comfortable. He told me that I was
      being overly kind to politicians in my analysis. He said, &quot;Every year
      that I was in office I knew who my 10 biggest donors were. I knew that
      I had to
        show
        them that I was working for what they wanted or they would just take
      their money and go to the other guy. And, you know, I don't think I ever
      once looked
      in the mirror and said, 'What am I doing for the average person in my district?'&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Not all those donors are individual constituents; many are lobbyists paid
      for by our corporations. Consider how ownership of corporate stock is concentrated
      in a small portion of our society. Yes, 52% of us own corporate stock &#8212; but
      <a href="../issues/wealth/90-9-1_Tables.html">88% of that stock value is
      held by the top 10% of us</a>, so the benefits that
      flow to
      corporations are not widely shared. (<a href="../issues/wealth/50-40-5-4-1.htm">The
      top 5% of us own 78% of the stock</a>.)
      Privately held businesses are very concentrated, too: <a href="../issues/wealth/90-9-1_Tables.html">89%
      of that value is held by the top 10% of us</a>, and <a href="../issues/wealth/50-40-5-4-1.htm">83%
      is held by the top 5%</a>.) These are
      people
      for whom the lobbyists work, and they are the big donors to political campaigns.
      They have a large share of the minds of our elected representatives. </p>
  <p>Who benefits from what our elected representatives decide on our behalf?
    Consider one example: <strong>pork spending</strong>, such as that which
    appears in the highway bills.
    Pork spending works to increase the value of specific areas, and those who
    own the land there are the beneficiaries. Think back a couple generations
    to two federally funded bridges in New York State, the Verrazano Narrows
    Bridge
    and the Tappan Zee Bridge. The first made Staten Island's land valuable;
    the second, across the Hudson River, made Rockland County's land valuable.
    Our federal taxes went to pay
    for that, and private individuals were the big beneficiaries. The alternative?
    Collect a portion of that increase in land value as our common treasure.
    Collect a portion of the land value that results from each pork project as
    our common
    treasure. Few infrastructure projects do not create sufficient increases
    in land value to pay for themselves; the question is, who is entitled to
    that
    increase? We the people, or certain lucky individuals?</p>
  <p>Federal spending is only one of the benefits special interests receive.
    They also get rules written specially for their needs and well-being: privileges,
    or &quot;private laws.&quot;</p>
  <p>Let's work for a world free of privilege. To do that effectively, we need
    to understand the nature of the privileges that most seriously harm us: the
    privatization of what is legitimately our common treasure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as through
      an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position fortified,
      and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social
      and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by its very
      simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
      of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one for
      an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized world. <strong>And
      back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an active, energetic
      power, a power that in every country, be its political forms what they may,
      writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast and dominant pecuniary
      interest. ...</strong></p>
  <p>...For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be
    taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power.

  <div align="left">
    <p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
      have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought about
      under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth. It
      is the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes
      a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth. Let
      us work by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against it,
      it is hard pulling and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take some
rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.*</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar
          with economic terminology may assume, the whole amount paid for the
          use of real estate. It is only that part of such amount which is paid
          for the use of the bare land or site employed, exclusive of the payment
          for the use of any buildings or other improvements on it. H. G. B.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
      need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount
      of land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes,
      land, no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held,
      would be really common property, and every member of the community would
      participate in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
    <p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily
      be increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition
      into practical form by proposing --</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land
          values.</em></strong></p>
    <p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
      but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of
      the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country, even
      the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear
      the entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries it
      is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place
      all taxes upon the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds
      the present governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount
      demanded in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses
      and rent advances. But this is so natural and easy a matter, that it may
      be considered as involved, or at least understood, in the proposition to
      put all taxes on the value of land. That is the first step upon which the
      practical struggle must be made. When the hare is once caught and killed,
      cooking him will follow as a matter of course. When the common right to
      land is so far appreciated that all taxes are abolished save those which
      fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more than is necessary to induce
      them to collect the public revenues being left to individual landholders.</p>
    <p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds
      lodgment sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but
      there are few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first,
      or even for a long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is a
        real antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over
        the idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly to
        tax them.</li>
      <li> It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
        capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
        poorer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance
        and prejudice there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated
        literature,
      education, and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong
      which in every civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty
      and want, will not die without a bitter struggle. </strong>... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/07_Simplicity_Introducing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

  <br>
  <small>We have
    here abolished all hereditary privileges and legal
    distinctions of class. Monarchy, aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept
    them all away. We have carried mere political democracy to its
    ultimate. Every child born in the United States may aspire to be
    President. Every man, even though he be a tramp or a pauper, has a
    vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any other man's vote.
    Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In the name of the
    people all laws run. They are the source of all power, the fountain
    of all honor. In their name and by their will all government is
    carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
    Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
    have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
    infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it
    is possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for
    our public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had
    the preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that
    here every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full
    liberty of speech and of the press. We have not merely common
    schools, but high schools and universities, open to all who may
    choose to attend. Yet here the same social difficulties apparent on
    the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to appear. It is already
    clear that our democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of
equality a sham and a fraud.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Already are the sovereign people
becoming but a roi
fain&eacute;ant, like the Merovingian kings of France, like the
Mikados of Japan. The shadow of power is theirs; but the substance of
power is being grasped and wielded by the bandit chiefs of the stock
exchange, the robber leaders who organize politics into machines. In
any matter in which they are interested, the little finger of the
great corporations is thicker than the loins of the people. Is it
sovereign States or is it railroad corporations that are really
represented in the elective Senate which we have substituted for an
hereditary House of Lords? Where is the count or marquis or duke in
Europe who wields such power as is wielded by such simple citizens as
our Stanfords, Goulds, and Vanderbilts? What does legal equality
amount to, when the fortunes of some citizens can be estimated only
in hundreds of millions, and other citizens have nothing? What does
the suffrage amount to when, under threat of discharge from
employment, citizens can be forced to vote as their employers
dictate? when votes can be bought on election day for a few dollars
apiece? If there are citizens so dependent that they must vote as
their employers wish, so poor that a few dollars on election day seem
to them more than any higher consideration, then giving them votes
simply adds to the political power of wealth, and universal suffrage
becomes the surest basis for the establishment of tyranny. "Tyranny"!
There is a lesson in the very word. What are our American bosses but
the exact antitypes of the Greek tyrants, from whom the word comes?
They who gave the word tyrant its meaning did not claim to rule by
right divine. They were simply the Grand Sachems of Greek Tammanys,

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[08] </span>But to the changes  produced by growth are, with us, added the changes brought about by  improved industrial methods. The tendency of steam and of machinery is  to the division of labor, to the concentration of wealth and power.  Workmen are becoming massed by hundreds and thousands in the employ of  single individuals and firms; small storekeepers and merchants are  becoming the clerks and salesmen of great business houses; we have  already corporations whose revenues and payrolls belittle those of the  greatest States. And with this concentration grows the facility of  combination among these great business interests. How readily the  railroad companies, the coal operators, the steel producers, even the  match manufacturers, combine, either to regulate prices or to use the  powers of government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to  the formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and  which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may  thus be served.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[09] </span>It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great  aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to  corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of the  people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars &mdash; except two  million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in power, no  matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for reform, for it  instinctively fears change. It never struggles against misgovernment.  When threatened by the holders of political power it does not agitate,  nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is in this way, no less  than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth corrupts  government, and helps to make politics a trade. <strong>Our organized lobbies,  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon  the hopes of moneyed interests. When "business" is dull, their resource  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat.  So, too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political  funds, on the principle of keeping on the right side of those in power,  just as the railroad companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes  to Florida to fish.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[10] </span>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence.</strong> A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
  of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
  it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
  earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
  to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
  gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
  is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
  the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
  competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
  their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
  in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
  a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
  the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
  doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
  time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
  chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
  due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
  in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[16]</font> As for the great railroad managers, they may well say, &quot;The people
    be d--d!&quot; When they want the power of the people they buy the people's
    masters. The map of the United States is colored to show States and Territories.
    A map of real political powers would ignore State lines. Here would be a big
    patch representing the domains of Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would
    be brightly marked. In another place would be set off the empire of Stanford
    and Huntington; in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and
    parts of States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be distinguished
    from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on. In our National Senate,
    sovereign members of the Union are supposed to be represented; but what are
    more truly represented are railroad kings and great moneyed interests, though
    occasionally a jobber from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling
    powers, is suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well
    as the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king makes
    his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to make his chaplain
    a bishop. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

      from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp; </small></a><small>(1883)</small></small> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great Wealth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
    recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
    I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate than
    he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get
    his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced it than
    did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for the rest
    of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land in the
    early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable. His wealth
    represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of
    the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
    leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
    skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
    he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
    a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper labor
    of Europe," gave him the advantage of a 66% tariff. To the
    day of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade would
    ruin
    our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to
    lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
    what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by the tariff
    that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth."</small>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
    and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account
    for all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
    first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it.
    But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
    fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money enough he
    used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran off opposition
    lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he went into railroads,
    pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working
    and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould
    might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial.
    But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions. It
    was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting
    up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values and
    transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which
    the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
    profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations of
    Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging.
    And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company,
    the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and
    the various rings for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper
    labor of Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of successful
    patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
    value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I
    am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
    in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
    out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
    through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes,
    these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
    of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me recently, "It
    is not on our ordinary business that we make our money; it is where we can
    get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
  <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
  of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
    their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
    ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
    of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
    pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
    was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
    by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get
    a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that
    it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which we
    give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by law and
    by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously rich while
    others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note the elements
    of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building up of all,
    or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous are those
    who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations and that
    the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities
    of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk
    as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
    restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the capitalist
    is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any one get
    as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution
    of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor
    in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the
    laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments
    which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that
    in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion
    to his contribution to the general stock. And in such a social state there
    would not be less incentive to exertion than now; there would be far more
    incentive. Men will be more industrious and more moral, better workmen and
    better citizens, if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his
    family, than where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them
    until some have far more than they could have earned, and others have little
    or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

  </span> THE power of a special interest, though inimical to the general interest,
  so to influence common thought as to make fallacies pass as truths, is a great
  fact, without which neither the political history of our own time and people,
  nor that of other times and peoples, can be understood. A comparatively small
  number of individuals brought into virtual though not necessarily formal agreement
  of thought and action by something that makes them individually wealthy without
  adding to the general wealth, may exert an influence out of all proportion
  to their numbers. A special interest of this kind is, to the general interests
  of society, as a standing army is to an unorganized mob. It gains intensity
  and energy in its specialization, and in the wealth it takes from the general
  stock finds power to mold opinion. Leisure and culture and the circumstances
  and conditions that command respect accompany wealth, and intellectual ability
  is attracted by it. On the other hand, those who suffer from the injustice
  that takes from the many to enrich the few, are in that very thing deprived
  of the leisure to think, and the opportunities, education, and graces necessary
  to give their thought acceptable expression. They are necessarily the "unlettered," the "ignorant," the "vulgar," prone
  in their consciousness of weakness to look up for leadership and guidance to
  those who have the advantages that the possession of wealth can give. &#8212; <em>The

WE may be wise to distrust our knowledge; and, unless we have tested them, to
distrust what we may call our reasonings; but never to distrust reason itself.
. . . That the powers with which the human reason must work are limited and are
subject to faults and failures, our reason itself teaches us as soon as it begins
to examine what we find around us and to endeavor to look in upon our own consciousness.
But human reason is the only reason that men can have, and to assume that in
so far as it can see clearly it does not see truly, is in the man who does it
not only to assume the possession of a superior to human reason, but it is to
deny the validity of all thought and to reduce the mental world to chaos. &#8212; <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe305.html">The

<p>    William Ogilvie: <a href="../docs/Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">An Essay on
    the Right of Property in Land</a> (Scotland, 1782)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That nation is greatly deceived
and misled which bestows any
encouragement on manufactures for exportation, or for any purpose but
the necessary internal supply, until the great manufactures of grain
and pasturage are carried to their utmost extent -- it can never be in
the interest of the community; it may be in that of the landholders,
who desire indeed to be considered as the nation itself, or at least as
being representatives of the nation, and having the same interest with
the whole body of the people.</small><br>
<br>
<small>(When mention is made in political reasonings of the interest of
any
nation, and those circumstances, by which it is supposed to be injured
or promoted, are canvassed, it is generally the interest of the
landholders that is kept in view.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>In fact, however, their interest is, in some most important
respects,
directly opposite to that of the great body of the community, over whom
they exercise an ill-regulated jurisdiction, together with an
oppressive monopoly in the commerce of land to be hired for cultivation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Property in Land, as at present established, is a monopoly of
the most
pernicious kind. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The interest of
landholders is substituted for that of
the community; it ought to be the same, but it is not. The landholders
of a nation levy the most oppressive of all taxes; they receive the
most unmerited of all pensions: if tithes are oppressive to industry,
rents capable of being raised from time to time are much more so.</span>...

Essay</a>
(circa 1782)<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Ogilvie, who came
after Locke, devotes himself in this treatise to one subject - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Birthright in land</span>,
it may be called. And the Author may be justly styled - The Euclid of
Land Law Reform. He has left little or nothing unsolved in connection
with the Land Question. He has given us a true base line -- man&#8217;s equal
right to the raw material of the earth, to the air, to the water, to
the rays of the sun, and all natural products -- from which we can work
out any problem, and by which we can test the &#8220;title and measure&#8221; of
every man&#8217;s property. Resting on this baseline -- man&#8217;s natural rights
-- he represents to us the perpendicular line of man's right to labour,
&#8220;with security of reaping its full produce and just reward.&#8221; Here we
have the question in a nutshell. Take away the base line, and you have
no right to labour, and no produce or reward, except what may be meted
out by the usurper of your natural rights. You have to beg for leave to
toil! We thus see clearly how the robbery of labour may be prevented,
and how impossible it is to put a stop to such robbery while the
industrial classes neglect to claim and exercise their natural right --
their right to an equal share in the earth, and all its natural
products.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Strikes against low wages, high rents, unjust taxation, absurd
conflicts between capital and labour, rebellions against this or that
form of government, are futile skirmishes, and very frequently are of
the suicidal cock-fighting order, at which the real enemy, elevated on
a grand stand, simply laugh. To contend successfully with these evils,
society must learn to begin at the source thereof. While labourers are
content to remain deprived of their natural rights, they must pay
whatever ransom the <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Glossary.html">brigands</a>
who have seized these rights choose to demand. Not only is industry
robbed, taxed, and crippled, but the brigand, as dog-in-the-manger,
very often puts an entire stop to it, and thus the happiness and
comfort of millions of mankind, who are willing to work, are curtailed
or wholly sacrificed, and misery and starvation reign instead. I am
somewhat afraid to say hard things against brigandage. An institution
that is still propped up by Law and Order, and supported (or winked at)
on almost every hand by the avowed servants of Jesus Christ, must be
touched with a &#8220;gentle hand.&#8221; William Ogilvie has done so in the Essay
now before us. Although a landlord himself, he did not disregard the
truth, and it will be found that his pen was guided by an impartial and
benevolent spirit. &nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a suggestive fact that
must impress any one who
thinks over the history of past eras and preceding civilizations. The
great, wealthy and powerful nations have always lost their freedom;
it is only in small, poor and isolated communities that Liberty has
been maintained. So true is this that the poets have always sung that
Liberty loves the rocks and tile mountains; that she shrinks from
wealth and power and splendor, from the crowded city and the busy
mart....</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The mere growth of society
involves danger of the gradual
conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
follow it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The same methods which, in
a little town where each knows
his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great
city, as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of
plunderers to gain and hold the government. So, too, as we see in
Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the growth of the
country and the greater number of interests make the proportion of
the votes of a representative, of which his constituents know or care
to know, less and less.</span> And so, too, the executive and judicial
departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the
people.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to the changes produced by
growth are, with us, added the
changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of
steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the
concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by
hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;
small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen
of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues
and pay rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this
concentration grows the facility of combination among these great
business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal
operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers,
combine, either to regulate prices or to use the powers of
government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to the
formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and
which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may
thus be served. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is not merely positively, but
negatively, that great
aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
the people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars -- except
two million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in
power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests. When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
companies deadhead [transport for free] President
[Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> As for the great railroad
managers, they may well say, "The
people be d-d!" When they want the power of the people they buy the
people's masters. The map of the United States is colored to show
States and Territories. A map of real political powers would ignore
State lines. Here would be a big patch representing the domains of
Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would be brightly marked. In
another place would be set off the empire of Stanford and Huntington;
in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and parts of
States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be
distinguished from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on.
In our National Senate, sovereign members of the Union are supposed
to be represented; but what are more truly represented are railroad
longs and great moneyed interests, though occasionally a mine jobber
from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling powers, is
suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well as
the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king
makes his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to
make his chaplain a bishop.... &nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<p>Henry George &#8212; The Study of Political Economy</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the first place, the very importance of the subjects with which political
        economy deals raises obstacles in its way. The discoveries of other sciences
        may challenge pernicious ideas, but the conclusions of political economy involve
        pecuniary interests, and thus thrill directly the sensitive pocket-nerve. For,
        as no social adjustment can exist without interesting a larger or smaller class
        in its maintenance, political economy at every point is apt to come in contact
        with some interest or other which regards it as the silversmiths of Ephesus
        did those who taught the uselessness of presenting shrines to Diana. <strong>Macaulay
        has well said that, if any large pecuniary interest were concerned in denying
        the attraction of gravitation, that most obvious of physical facts would not
        lack disputers. </strong>This is just the difficulty that has beset and still besets
        the progress of political economy. The man who is, or who imagines that he
        is, interested in the maintenance of a protective tariff, may accept all your
        professors choose to tell him about the composition of the sun or the evolution
        of species, but, no matter how clearly you demonstrate the wasteful inutility
        of hampering commerce, he will not be convinced. And so, to the man who expects
        to make money out of a railroad-subsidy, you will in vain try to prove that
        such devices to change the natural direction of labour and capital must cause
        more loss than gain. What, then, must be the opposition which inevitably meets
        a science that deals with tariffs and subsidies, with banking interests and
        bonded debts, with trades-unions and combinations of capital, with taxes and
        licenses and land tenures! It is not ignorance alone that offers opposition,
        but ignorance backed by interest, and made fierce by passions. <br>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Poverty Alleged to be Inevitable</strong></p>
  <p>Now, as it did then, the Malthusian theory parries the demand for reform,
      and shelters selfishness from question and from conscience by the interposition
      of an inevitable necessity. For poverty, want and starvation are by this theory
      not chargeable either to individual greed or to social maladjustments - they
      are the inevitable results of universal laws with which if it were not impious
      it were as hopeless to quarrel as with the law of gravitation.<strong> And
      thus reforms which would interfere with the interests of any powerful class
      are discouraged
      as hopeless.</strong> Since the moral law forbids any forestalling of the methods by
      which the natural law gets rid of surplus population and thus holds in check
      a tendency to increase potent enough to pack the surface of the globe with
      human beings as sardines are packed in a box, nothing can really be done either
      by individual or by combined effort to extirpate poverty, save to trust to
      the efficacy of education and preach the necessity of prudence. ... <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/chp6.htm">Read the

  <p>There will always be critics who concoct a huge cost in getting assessments
      correct down to the last penny, or claim, without any evidence, that real
    estate is a trivial portion of the economy. Such critics date back to the
    days of
      Henry George, when the landed interests felt threatened by his ideas. Those
      opponents have been thoroughly rebutted in the book, Critics of Henry George
      (the latest edition edited in 2004 by Robert Andelson). The reasons for
    such attempts to falsify and trivialize rent-based public finance, and even
    to eliminate
      the land factor from economics, are chronicled and analyzed in The Corruption
      of Economics, especially in the chapter by Mason Gaffney, &#8220;Neo-classical
      Economics as a Stratagem against Henry George.&#8221; This negative viewpoint
      is perpetuated by academics who learn of land value taxation from misleading
      secondary sources, not bothering to dig any further.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system benefits
    certain vested interests that will resist reform. But since the public at
    large will benefit from a shift to land value taxation, and since they greatly
    outnumber those obtaining privileges from the current system, the greater
    reason why this tax reform has not taken place is that the public has not
    been informed. Once citizens, taxpayers, consumers, and voters understand
    the option of obtaining public revenue from land value or rent, then the
    logic of getting both greater efficiency and greater justice may well prevail.

  <p>    Q: What are the greatest political obstacles confronting developing countries
      to the extraction of economic &quot;rent&quot; for public purposes? Is
      it simply a matter of &quot;vested interests?&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, it's not very complicated. You know, in the Clinton Administration,
    we tried to reform the disposition of natural resources &#8212; mineral rights &#8212; by
    saying the US Government should not be giving this away to a few wealthy
    people. But the mining interests were adamant in opposing this reform. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  Under the normal system which this article advocates, the user of land would
        pay substantially the same economic rent as now, for the reason that economic
        rent is fixed by the payer and not by the payee; but it would be paid to
        the credit of the community instead of for the benefit of the individual
        landowner. And the economic rent is all the land user would have to pay;
        no taxes on industry or personal product and no other forced contribution
        for governmental purposes. <font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself.</p>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice.</p>
  <p>  How did so evident a wrong become so firmly established? <font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>  The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their tenure
        of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary have so buttressed
        it with centuries of legislation, precedents, and judicial decisions, that
        any proposition to hark back to the terms of the original bargain, whereby
        the owners of the land agreed to pay the expenses of the government, is now
        denounced as anarchy and sacrilege.</p>
  <p>  Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a buyer
        acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic rent belongs
        to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it as soon as the voters
        thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and wrong of the matter, which
        are not hard to grasp when the subject is presented in its simplest form.</p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice? ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole

<small>THE FREE LUNCH</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Its cost to citizens</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Its cost to the economy</small><br>
<small>SUMMARY&nbsp; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain."
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually
a "land gain," that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Over the past 40 years I have
specialised in the study of the
factors that raise or lower the nation's overall real estate prices
-- rising income and savings levels, shifting interest rates and the
financial sector's supply of mortgage credit, as well as changes in
the tax laws and related market-shaping rules. This work for Wall
Street banks and institutional investors was burdened by the absence
of reliable data on the value of land and buildings. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The official
nationwide real estate statistics do suggest that a politically
motivated asymmetry is at work in the economy, benefiting real
estate,</span> which I shall now attempt to identify. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">... </span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>...&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b>... 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
DRIVING FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble. <big>...</big></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Immortally aging
buildings</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be
minimized in two ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The most general -- and also the most economically
pernicious
-- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. The working
assumption is that interest charges are a truly inherent business
expense, not simply the result of a business decision taken by
investors to leverage their equity. For interest to be an inherent
business expense, interest-bearing debt would have to be a factor of
production, which it is not. Properties would yield their rent
regardless of how they are financed. Investors choose to rely on debt
rather than equity financing because the tax laws favor it, thanks to
the political lobbying of <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutional
creditors ("the debt lobby")</span>. Homeowners too deduct interest
payments, which encourages borrowing.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to
depreciation
the building, that is, annually deduct from taxable income part of the
purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is "written
off" </b>It's the most unique tax advantage enjoyed by the real estate
industry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investors are able
to depreciate their buildings based on their assessed acquisition
price, regardless of the actual building costs involved or the level of
economy-wide land-price inflation. </span>Investors depreciate
buildings at rising prices even when prior owners already have
depreciated these structures once or even many times. For real estate
owned by households and partnerships (the latter being the preferred
legal instrument for holding residential apartment buildings and office
buildings), the Fed has estimated much higher proportions of land to
buildings, but these estimates also overvalue buildings relative to
land. <b>Every time a property changes hands at a higher price,
building assessments are raised proportionally - and begin to be
re-depreciated for these higher valuations, regardless of how often the
buildings already have been written off! There is no limit as to how
often a building can be re-depreciated.</b> What matters is simply how
often the property changes nominal hands.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
fiscal privilege has created a
phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tax laws governing
depreciation thus turn largely on how much
value is assigned to buildings relative to the land, which is not
depreciable. Like manufacturers, real estate owners are permitted to
count part of the revenue over and above their current expenses as a
return of their capital investment, as distinct from taxable earnings
on capital. No income taxes are levied on this part of their revenue.
That is only fair, because an investor who buys a $100 bond only pays
tax on the interest, not on the original $100 principal. Likewise,
industrialists can recover their initial investment in plant and
equipment without being taxed. Their "sunk cost" gets reimbursed, so
that they get their capital back by the time the equipment wears out
or becomes obsolete.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
real estate, however, the
economics are unique. Machinery
rarely can be re-depreciated, but this is not true of buildings as
long as they are kept in proper repair. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance and repairs
typically consume about 10 percent of the rental value.</span> For
business
owners, the explicit purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the
building's value intact, so that it can survive year after year and
avoid obsolescence while its site value rises. If a building is sold
at a higher price, its assessment usually is raised.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Suppose a
property is sold for twice the $1 milliuon the owner paid for it. The
local appraiser is likely to say; "I see you've sold your building
for $2 million. Under my rule of thumb, I appraise the land as half
this value, and the building as half, so that gives you a $1 million
dollar building." Under this rule, the building that was formerly
priced at $500,000 can be re-depreciated at a price that builds in
this $500,000 gain. In this way a substantial portion of the rise in
site value of non-depreciable land is treated as depreciable building
value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REAL ESTATE LOBBIES recognize that
what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This explains the seeming irony
that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The 2001 Nobel Prize was awarded
to economists who recognized the
unevenness of market knowledge. It would seem that this asymmetry
exists especially in the real industry. Investors and developers know
that the name of the game is capital gains. They use one set of
statistics to calculate their Total Returns, but get government
statisticians and Congressional authors of the nation's tax laws.to
support a different logic for their tax returns.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Tax favouritism for real estate
was defended in Congress on the
ground that it was in the public interest to provide a special
inducement to the real estate industry to build more homes and office
buildings.</b> But as Adam Smith observed, every industry represents
itself as serving the public interest. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Can one really say that
investors borrowing 70 percent of private-sector loans to ride the
wave of asset-price inflation are more in the national economic
interest than favoring direct investors to build new plant and
businesses that employ labor rather than pricing homes, office
buildings and industrial sites further and further out of reach of
those who must earn their income by increasing society's productive
powers?</span></small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>SUMMARY</b>
</small><br>
<small>For hundreds of years property's value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent a
    potentially important source of public
    revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
    in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
    productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
    invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
    than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
    wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
  REVENUE </b></small><br>
  <small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
    whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
  market value for three reasons: </small><br>
  <small>the limited supply and "natural"
  productivity of the soil and natural resources,</small><br>
  <small> </small><small>the publicly provided
    services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
    value of land and </small><br>
  <small> </small><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
    demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. </span>The community added to the market value to land by
making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any
moves to enact good government principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. </span>When the community
collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small>When the rent of land is taken for public purposes production
and
distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25%.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
<br>
<small>In order to preserve the environment, it is necessary and
possible
to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone else will</span>.
This is why efficient land use fails under
contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
all of the market rent of land. </small><span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
classical economic thought still
regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a
function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John
Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve optimal economic
productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from each of
those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of capital
was interest; and the price of land, particularly following the
thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. Rent in its classical sense
means payment for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more
generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted
if the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we
shall see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not
seeing any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent
economics profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to
regard land as a separate factor and to redefine the terms of
production instead in two-factor theory. This was concurrent with
the inclusion of land as property, since called "real property." </small><br>
<br>
<small>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped
under
title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be regarded
as a private financial asset. Earlier it was regarded as part of
nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting practices
now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a liability
on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to banks. This
tendency has been extended today so that we have privatized much of
our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came to be simply one
kind of capital, nothing special, nothing requiring further
treatment. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an artifact of intellectual
history. The conflation of land into capital to create two-factor
economics is one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the evolution of
social philosophy. How the premises and terms of economic discourse
have been changed has been documented for the first time in a new
book by a California professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The
account is put forth in fascinating detail entitled, <b><i><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
Corruption of Economics</a>.</i></b> It was indeed a corruption of a
discipline, a deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an
interest in seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been
paying the price since that time. This revealing thesis is what I
really want to relate to you, and to explain the dire consequences it
has had for us in our contemporary world. I have come to believe it;
it makes sense to me, both historically and in contemporary analysis,
from several perspectives.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b></small><br>
<small>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later, one the continuing tradition of
Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, a second being the aggressive and
emerging school of Marxism, and the third a proposal for two-factor
economics being pressed largely by interests in America. Marxism was
never a major force in United States; the primary challenge to the
classical tradition came from what has since come to be known as
neo-classical economics.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly- established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a></i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two-factor
economics, however, had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests</span>. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
<strong>three-factor economics</strong>, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.... <a

<p>Alanna Hartzok: <a href="docs/Hartzok_HG%27sST.html">In the History of Thought:
    Henry George's &quot;Single Tax&quot; </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, while riding horseback in the Oakland hills,
    merchant seaman and journalist Henry George had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that speculation
      and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the root causes of the
      unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights
    presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
    George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy approach was
    known at that time as the "single tax" - meaning that taxation should be shifted
    off of labor and onto the socially created surplus value of land and other natural
    resources.</span> His message reached as far as the great Russian Leo Tolstoy,
    who was so taken with
    the idea that he frequently referred to George and "Georgism" in his
    novel Resurrection.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last 20 years of the 19th century George built
    an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of the wealth gap,
    and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's
    mayor. The "Georgists" were determined to free labor and all productive effort
    from the burden of taxation. Land and natural resources were gifts of nature
    to be fairly shared by all. The role of government would be to secure democratic
    rights to the earth for all people via the collection of resource rents,
    the surplus value accruing to natural wealth, which would be distributed
    in social
    goods, services or by
    direct citizen dividends.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as this solution
    to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist movement was stopped
    in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their money into leading schools of
    economics to encourage the writing of treatises against George and the movements
    he had spawned. </span>The ethical perspective that land is a common heritage
    and the policy approach of land value taxation were subsequently eliminated
    from the field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on only two
    primary
    factors -- labor and capital -- with capital having the upper
    hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of self-employment
    given access to land. This is what the elites and the plutocrats feared most
    - that labor would gain full power to directly produce capital given conditions
    of equal rights to the resources of

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Back in the early days of this
century, Winston Churchill saw and
recorded an example of this. There had been a ferry fare over the
river Thames for the common laborers who lived on the wrong side of
the river to pay in order to get to work. A spirit of nobility
prompted the absorption of this fare by the City, and almost
immediately rents in the working class area were increased by the
same amount as the fare had been. When this thing was done, the guys
who got the benefit were not the poor working class people, but the
owners of the homes in which they lived, or, more accurately and more
critically, the owners of the land on which those homes stood. The
laborers were thus charged a higher rent, and that rent diverted the
benefit from the seemingly intended beneficiary (i.e., the public) to
landowners in the affected area.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This occurs every day in this
country. A new road is built, or a
superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a particular site
much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to the
traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of higher land
prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are served by this
new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for the insider
information or for influence over the selection.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robert Caro, in his biography of
Robert Moses, recalls the time in
the early 1920s that Moses suggested to the authorities the building
of a causeway from the Long Island mainland over to Jones Island.
This proposal was rejected outright by the Long Island Park
Commission. Some months later, Moses presented them with a drawing
showing precisely where this causeway would run, and, after a
suitable period of during which these public employees could buy up
the land along the proposed highway, he resubmitted his proposal.
This time, they officially approved the suggested construction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the town of Antioch, Illinois,
there were two developments
underway almost simultaneously. In the one, roads were provided,
together with water and sewer lines, but no sidewalks; in the other,
just across a main road from the first, the mayor of the city had
storm sewers, curbs and sidewalks installed at public expense, for
which of course, any prospective buyer or tenant would gladly pay for
use of that land the higher price these added benefits provided. Any
reader will recognize this chain of events and set of economic
relationships as being the course of everyday life and business at
the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would say that a
primary motivation for entering local or even national politics would
be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by publicly
financed improvements. ...</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>... Thus, the benefits of a
tax-supported public work accrued once
more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to that of a very
limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich enough to own
land in that location.<br>
</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly many other
problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and
understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value taxation over
all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome
plight into which we have been led increasingly over the recent years
must be the adoption of land value taxation. </small><small>... <a

Is There a Conspiracy in the Teaching of Economics and History

<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Progress Report</b> -
For an economics professor,
you're said to be
quite an expert on the environment, what's the connection?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic
analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Faced with the obvious growth of
environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivialize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The legitimate goals of
environmentalists, they coopt and distort.
Here are two examples. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They'll tell you that it's not OK to promote oil
conservation by
taxing withdrawals, but it is OK to do so by monopolizing the industry
- monopolists are our best friends. </small></li>
  <li><small>They'll tell you it's not OK to check polluters by taxing
their
effluents, but it is OK to give them property rights to pollute, based
on past emissions, and then buy those rights back from them at their
price. You think I'm just making that up? I wish I were! The EPA is
actually applying that idea around the country. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thank you, John B. Clark; thank
you, neo-classical economics. It
all follows from Clark's efforts to avoid any recognition that
natural resources are common property: in this case, the air itself
is turned into private property. Your very right to breathe, you have
to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that
ownership? By their track records of dumping their crud in the air in
the past. It beggars belief, but there it is: it shows what the war
against Henry George has made of the discipline of economics.&nbsp; ...

    Owns Southern California?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
These same interests wield special influence on private and public
higher education, working behind the scenes. They stand in well with
the press: in fact, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chandler
family of the Times-Mirror Company</span> is one of them, owning the
vast Tejon Ranch. Scott Newhall was once editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle. (It is alleged by Stanley Sapiro that "the Newhall ranch was
assembled by the owners of the San Francisco Chronicle." ) They
dominate Chambers of Commerce. They generally dominate the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California (MWDSC)</span>, the regional water supply agency, which has
long overtaxed the City of Los Angeles to subsidize expansion to
outlying areas.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is run by
a
Board of 50 Directors, representing 27 cities and districts that it
serves. Those from cities are elected on the basis of
"one-person-one-vote." Those from several outlying districts are
elected by "one-acre-one-vote." Representatives from landowner-run
districts remain the same from election to election, thus gaining
seniority to dominate the 50-person Board.</small><br>

<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Thus
a

Accordingly, MWDSC preaches water

is probably no accident that its current President represents the
Western Municipal Water District of Riverside County, an area dominated

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
COMMON THEME FROM
FOREST, CITY AND FARM</span> </small><br>
<small>Market failure, public programs and perverse
incentives in the land market create a gross bias towards spreading out
too much.&nbsp; This aggravates otherwise fairly tractable runoff
problems.&nbsp; The more Tierra Desnuda, the more runoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>This perversion does not occur by accident.&nbsp;
Spread and sprawl in forestry, cities and agriculture are common
results of the dominant force driving American politics, the quest for
unearned increments to land value.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Thorstein Veblen in his final testament, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Absentee
Ownership</span>, noted that American farmers &nbsp;</small><br style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">...have
always, ... wanted something more than their ... share of
the soil; not because they were driven by a felt need of doing more
than their fair share of work ..., but with a view to ... getting
a little something for nothing in allowing their holdings to be turned
to account</span> (Veblen, pp. 138-40).&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>To enhance those values they will now invoke
any complaisant higher power, and since God already did His bit by
donating the Earth, they turn to Government.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the profile of land values
is like
a volcanic
island.&nbsp; To raise the top and the slopes and the shores we must
also raise the shallows above sea level, where they shed the waters and
come into use.&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Rising population is one factor pushing up the
profile of values, but not the strongest one.&nbsp; Increased demand
per capita is the main factor.&nbsp; These demands include all the
spurious demands described above, like the demand of government for
land to "bank" and hold idle, and the demand of speculators "with a
view to getting a little something for nothing."&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Veblen went on to say that farm technology adapts to
the Procrustean bed of absentee ownership: rather than leading,
technology lags changes wrought by the ownership pattern.&nbsp; Thus it
is not "society" or "efficiency" alone that mandate inorganic
monocultural chemical farming, but also the peculiar needs of absentee
owners holding more land than they can work themselves or with their
families.&nbsp; Logic of, by and for this minority is set up as logic
for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>If this be true, or (more likely) partly true, it
must be admitted that most academics go along and get along with this
dominant minority.&nbsp; Organic farming, biological controls,
appropriate technology, IPM, and other countervailing logics had to
come from screwballs outside the system, plus a few martyrs and
kamikazes inside it, dominated as it is by accommodating "regular
fellows," "good old boys," noncontroversial administrators who
"understand local needs" and "work with community leaders," and
complaisant faculty who enjoy "credibility."&nbsp; Are we part of the
problem?&nbsp; Let everyone debate that with his own conscience, and be
fair enough to lose a few points.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SOLUTIONS</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution is land
stewardship, a
new&#8209;old ethic to
supplant the cowboy ethic in which western man has wallowed over
several centuries of territorial expansion.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To reprise from the section on
forestry, we must
synthesize two concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp; Concept A says "save
for the future"; Concept B says put land to full use right now, to
serve and employ people.&nbsp; Concept AB says do both, but each in the
right place.&nbsp; Use the good land, use it well and fully, employ the
workers, serve everyone's needs.&nbsp; Congregate and cooperate on
central, low, flat, fertile ground, as efficient markets and efficient
public policies would dictate anyway.&nbsp; Leave the marginal land in
peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But as we tiptoe into this new era let us not sell
stewardship by making it too easy and trivial, lest we repeat the sorry
history of SCS.&nbsp; We are all trained to be trivial, to make few
ripples and no waves.&nbsp; We are conditioned by higher education, and
disciplined by employers to accept and believe the basic premises of
the system and contribute our mite, if any, only to reinforce or patch
or adorn it.&nbsp; Hence the fascination of schemes like effluent
charges and their analogues like excise taxes on surrogates.&nbsp; If
those ripples look like waves to us, it shows how much we have to grow
to deserve our ancestors.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Excise taxes have their place, true, but the
problems at hand are much vaster and deeper than little measures
reach.&nbsp; Solutions call for basic reconstruction and reorientation
more drastic than most of us dare contemplate.&nbsp; But let's try: it
might even be fun.&nbsp; Dan Hoan had fun making Milwaukee work; he is
as good a model as we need.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">Canada's System of
Revenue Sharing</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The federal aid in Canada goes
to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
Washington.</b> The Canadian provinces are much larger and stronger,
and fewer than the American States. There is much more horizontal
balancing among provinces in Canada than there is among States in the
United States. The Maritimes for instance get about 50% of their
provincial revenues from equalisation entitlements. Fifty percent.
Nothing in the United States matches that. In fact, if you look at
the U.S. Constitution, it's quite specifically planned to prevent
that sort of thing. Equalisation is not what the Founding Fathers had
in mind. On the contrary, there is a provision which you may be
familiar with which says that direct taxes will be apportioned among
the States according to their respective populations. So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.

Jesus
Tax?&nbsp; The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A University of Alabama School
of Law Professor has asked God's
forgiveness for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax
injustice. Susan Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and
dedicated United Methodist church goer, thought there was a misprint
when she first read that personal incomes as low as $4,600 for a family
of four were being taxed by the state, while timber owners holding 71%
of the land of Alabama were paying less than $1 per acre in property
taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been no mistake and that
Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country. Her righteous
rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
scene.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a
design of a tax structure this bad," she said in a Tuscaloosa News
story last February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust
and has no moral, ethical leg to stand on. Period."</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes
in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just
4.1 percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of
property taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes
are among the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas,
and do not exempt even the most basic necessities such as food. The
state's 1901 constitution was written primarily by large landholders to
secure their economic interests, consequently property taxes are
extremely light on their holdings. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
"Alabama's tax system is most abusive because it taxes items like milk,
yet offers tax breaks for certain farm products," she said in a
Huntsville Times (3/26/03) interview. "It's also unfair to allow
timberland (which Hamill found out accounts for 71 percent of Alabama
land) to generate only two percent of all state property taxes."<br>
<br>
While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like
"horrific" and "monstrous injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax
reform approach which shifts taxes off of low wage earners and onto
large land owners. Through a combination of her own reasoning, caring
heart, and inherent sense of justice and a thorough investigation of
Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax policy approach which
bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of 19th
century reformer, Henry George.<br>
<br>
Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call
themselves Christians. Hamill challenges them to put their faith into
practice. Her message fell on many already listening ears. The state's
two largest denominations, United Methodists and Southern Baptists, had
passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In 2001 the state's
Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar calls. The
Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council of
Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now
supported by most of the state's religious organizations, according to
Charles Durham, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
<br>
What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama
tax code combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural
bases for economic justice. She quotes chapters and verses which
proclaim that the poor should not be oppressed and that society should
create conditions for their advance. Among her favorites are Jesus'
words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least
of these, you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich
man sent to hell because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and
so all went well." ...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Riley's tax plan, inspired in large measure by Hamill's prophetic tax
justice ministry, would bring in an additional $1.2 billion in revenue
while raising the income threshold at which families of four start
paying taxes from the current $4,600 a year to more than $17,000,
scrapping the federal income tax deduction, and increasing exemptions
for dependent children. It would give property tax breaks to small
family farms, while costing millions to the state's 500 or so farms and
timber tracts with more than 2,000 acres each, which includes companies
like Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade, which own hundreds of thousands of
acres.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
"I've spent a lot of time studying the New Testament and it has three
philosophies: love God, love each other, and take care of the least
among you," said Riley (New York Times, 6/10/03, "What Would Jesus Do?
Sock It to Alabama's Corporate Landowners")</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Unfortunately, Alabama voters overwhelmingly voted against the plan on
September 9, 2003. Some said that the poor did not trust the Republican
tax relief plan and the rich had solidly organized against it.
Opponents made hay out of the proposed sales tax increase on
cigarettes, cars and lawn mowers and services like car repairs in a
state where sales taxes already reach 11% in some areas. ...&nbsp;<span

<blockquote>
  <p>The galleys that carried Caesar to Britain, the accoutrements of his legionaries,
      the baggage that they carried, the arms that they bore, the buildings that
      they erected; the scythed chariots of the ancient Britons, the horses that
      drew them, their wicker boats and wattled houses&#8211;where are they now?
      But the land for which Roman and Briton fought, there it is still. That
      British soil is yet as fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans.
      Generation
      after generation has lived on it since, and generation after generation
      will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference. The right to
      possess
      and to pass on the ownership of things that in their nature decay and soon
      cease to be is a very different thing from the right to possess and to
      pass on the ownership of that which does not decay, but from which each
      successive
      generation must live.</p>
  <p>To show how this difference between land and such other species of property
      as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for the vested rights
      of landholders, let me illustrate again.</p>
  <p> Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a business of sailing the seas, capturing
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes.
    In this way he accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried.
    But let us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
    his wealth,
    but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs and so on, until
    at the present day this wealth or a part of it has come to a great-great-grandson
    of
    Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
    that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the shipmasters whom
    Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says: "This man's great-great-grandfather
    plundered my great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which
    have been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would have
    been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
    restore them." What would society answer?</p>
  <p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with principles
    recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We cannot entertain such
    a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's great-great-grandfather robbed your
    great-great-grandfather, and that as the result of this wrong he has got
    things that otherwise might have come to you. But we cannot inquire into
    occurrences
    that happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to
    its own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the controversies
    of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless disputes and pretexts
    for dispute. What you say may be true, but somewhere we must draw the line,
    and have an end to strife. Though this man's great-great-grandfather may
    have
    robbed your great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into
    possession of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully, and
    we must take
    this peaceful possession, when it has been continued for a certain time,
    as absolute evidence of just title; for, were we not to do that, there would
    be
    no end to dispute and no secure possession of anything."</p>
  <p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the statute
    of limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> This is the reason why it is held &#8211; and as
      to most things held justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for
      a certain time cures all defects of title.</span></p>
  <p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
  <p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and profitable
    piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son, and so on, until
    the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has come to consider it the most
    natural thing in the world that his ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much
    plunder, whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
    great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to work. But
    at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having their ships sunk
    and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of trembling for their lives every
    time a sail lifts above the horizon, and they demand of society that piracy
    be stopped.</p>
  <p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed to the
    doctrine of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound to prevent
    any interference
      with the business that he had inherited, and that, if it wanted him to
    stop, it must buy him out, paying him all that his business was worth&#8211;that
      is to say, at least as much as he could make in twenty years' successful
    pirating, so that if he stopped pirating he could still continue to live
    in luxury off
      of the profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
  <p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be but one answer.
    We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd that his was a business to
    which the statute of limitations and the doctrine of vested rights did not
    apply; that because his father, and his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather
    pursued the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the plank,
    was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it. Society, we will all
    agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy and stop it at once, and that
    without getting a cent for stopping.</p>
  <p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his piratical business
    to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree that society ought to say that
    their purchase of the business gave them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
  <p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe, I do not
    ask what society would say.</p>
  <p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied that,
    under the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for a long time
    say what
      we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would all the Kidds loudly claim
    that to make them give up their business without full recompense would be
    a wicked
      interference with vested rights, but the justice of this claim would at
    first be assumed as a matter of course by all or nearly all the influential
    classes&#8211;the
      great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for the magazines, the
    eloquent clergymen, and the principal professors in the principal universities.
    Nay,
      even the merchants and sailors, when they first began to complain, would
    be so tyrannized and browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly
      think of more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there
    any
      one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and without
      compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being stigmatized as
    a reckless disturber and wicked foe of social order.</p>
  <p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such fools, then I
    appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
  <p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any people,
    became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to you the truth of
    what I say. ...</p>
  <p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is not long since
    the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly respectable business, affording
    as legitimate an opening for the investment of capital and the display of enterprise
    as any other. The proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous,
    then as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very Constitution
    bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law of the nation, adopted
    twelve years after the enunciation of the Declaration of Independence, declare
    that for twenty years the slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted?
    Such dominion had the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who
    had already proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

  3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    The idea of regulation is that, while markets should ideally be as free
    as possible, there are times when an external actor, not driven by profit
    maximization, must impose some rules for the common good. When it comes to
    nature, government has many ways to regulate.</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> It may require timely disclosure of toxic releases.</li>
      <li> It may grant, sell, or deny rights to use public resources.</li>
      <li> It may ban some pollutants altogether, limit others, or tell polluters
                what technologies to use.</li>
      <li> It may divide the landscape into zones and specify what kinds of activities
                  can take place in each zone.</li>
      <li> It may tax certain activities and subsidize others.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>This wide array of tools &#8212; plus the power to prosecute rulebreakers &#8212; seemingly
          creates in government a formidable counterweight to corporations. Yet history
          has shown that government isn&#8217;t the regulatory tiger it appears to
          be. It faces fierce corporate resistance whenever it tries to exercise its
          powers. And time after time, its regulatory agencies have been captured by
        the industries they were intended to regulate.</p>
      <p>The process of regulatory capture has been described by many scholars. Details
          vary, but the plot is always the same. A new agency is created to regulate
          an industry that&#8217;s harming the public. At first the agency acts boldly,
          but over time its zeal wanes. Reformers who originally staffed the agency
          are replaced by people who either worked in the industry earlier, or hope
          to do so after a stint in government. Industry-packed &#8220;advisory committees&#8221; multiply,
          while industry-funded &#8220;think tanks&#8221; add a veneer of legitimacy
          to profit-driven proposals. Lobbyists meet constantly with agency staffers.
        The public, meanwhile, has no clue about what&#8217;s going on.</p>
      <p>This process has reached extreme proportions in recent years. As I write,
          the head of public lands in the Interior Department is a former mining industry
          lobbyist, the head of the air division at the EPA is a former utility lobbyist,
          the second in command at EPA is an ex-Monsanto lobbyist, and the head of
          Superfund cleanups at EPA (which makes industry clean up its toxic wastes)
          formerly advised companies on how to evade Superfund. Although today&#8217;s
          pro-industry bias may be more egregious than usual, the absence of outrage
        or resistance suggests it&#8217;s not far from the norm.</p>
      <p>And it&#8217;s not just regulatory agencies that have been captured. Congress
          itself, which oversees the agencies and writes their controlling laws, has
          been badly infected. According to the Center for Public Integrity, the &#8220;influence
          industry&#8221; in Washington now spends $6 billion a year and employs more
          than thirty-five thousand lobbyists, some two hundred of whom are former
        Congress members who enjoy easy access to their erstwhile colleagues.</p>
      <p>A glimpse at the corporate lobbying game shows just how rewarding it
        is. MBNA, the nation&#8217;s largest credit card bank, spent over $17
        million on lobbying between 1999 and 2004. This is pin money compared
        to the sums
          it will reap from an industry-drafted bankruptcy overhaul, passed in
        2005, which precludes all but the very poor from wiping out their debts
        and starting
          anew. (The great majority of Americans who file for bankruptcy are
        middle-class victims of job loss, huge medical bills, or family breakup.)
        A New York Times
          reporter described this scene as the bill was being marked up: &#8220;Lawyers
          and lobbyists jammed Congressional hearing rooms to overflowing. .
          . . During breaks, there was a common, almost comical pattern. The
          pinstriped lobbyists
          ran into the hallway, grabbed tiny cell phones from their pockets or
          briefcases, and reported back to their clients, almost always with
          the news they wanted
        to hear.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like <em>statism</em> conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, <em>privatism</em> connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system.</p>
  <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
    is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take data
    from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and display
    the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
  <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
    a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior of
    the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
    system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The algorithms
    are:<br>
    (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
    <strong>(2) distribute property income on a per-share basis</strong>, and<br>
    (3) the price of nature equals zero.<br>
    <strong>The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more property
    shares than the remaining 95 percent.</strong></p>
  <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell as
    much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources, and waste
    disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses the minds
    of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake up thinking about
    how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their product, they must
    create some. If they work in finance, they worry about margins and leverage.
    If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain hard, replace long-term
    employees with temps, and shift jobs to places where wages are lower. All
    the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to Wall Street.</p>
  <p>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s the
    combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism to devour
    nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time, nothing in the
    algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either individually or collectively,
    to preserve anything.</p>
  <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think about
    protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving something
    back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for actually doing
    such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does it mean that, from
    time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly flout the corporate
    algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying is that, in the great
    majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and its brethren are obeyed. For
    all practical purposes, the publicly traded corporation is a slave to its
    algorithm.</p>
