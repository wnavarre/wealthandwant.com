    Lectures,

<blockquote>
  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
  of vastly more concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers, enters
      into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate of profit upon
      that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the
      manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price
      and are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the tax with
      all intermediate profits upon it, together with their :usual rate of profit
      upon the whole, from final purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what
      appears on the surface to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination
      to be an indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of
      profits upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were imposed
      upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount of the
      tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect
      the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
      and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with their profit
      from retailers, who would collect with their profit from shoe consumers.
      The principle applies also when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales
      of merchants, or the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with
      the usual profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
      interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000;
        at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
        and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
        of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would
        get. Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that
        indirect
        taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed
        only upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed
        upon materials
        also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent in
        addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect taxes from
      the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers,
      or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest,
      it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is because
      the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other
      tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
      goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business. It
      follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase the price
      of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must
      pay as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the cost
      of their output as is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of
      the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase
      the price of their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as
      the tax is more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
            such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
            copyright publications
          is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly manufacturer whose
          prices are not checked by cost of production, and are therefore as a rule
          higher than competitive prices would be, may find it more profitable to
          bear the burden of a tax that leaves him some profit, by preserving his
          entire
          custom, than to drive off part of his custom by adding the tax to his usual
          prices. This is true also of a moderate import tax to the extent it falls
          upon goods that are more cheaply transported from the place of production
          to a foreign market where the import tax is imposed than to a home market
          where the goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance,
          of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian
          town. If the tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation
          the producer will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate
          effect would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples
          which may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are
          indirect,
          will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
          cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font> ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.<strong><font size="+1"> ...</font></strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers through
    many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase
        prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer,
        increasing as they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been
        often attempted, the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and
        the borrower must pay it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses
        it in his business, he in his turn must get back the tax from his customers,
        or his business becomes unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings,
        the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
        will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular
        profit and the tax besides. If we impose a tax upon manufactures or imported
        goods, the manufacturer or importer will charge it in a higher price
        to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and the retailer to the consumer.
        Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only
        pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this amount to everyone
        who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital he has advanced
        in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,
        book viii, ch. iii, subd. 2. </em></font>... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
