  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people

  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
    <br />
Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing the
processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the payer
works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes it,
of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 26 or in lesser
degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress

<blockquote>
      <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles.
        Locations are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are
        improved or not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others
        elsewhere,32 a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles
        of sound tax theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing,
        however, when looking at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present
        value&#8221; stock. The technical ability to trace changes in the market
        prices of sites &#8211; or as can also be understood, the variable flow
        of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by the application of GIS (geographic
        information systems) real-time recording of sales transactions invites
        wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral data. The transmittal
        of sales records as typically received in the offices of local governments
        for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices allows
        for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
        Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
        reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
        easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
        features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through
        local or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas
        of greatest market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent
        can easily be taxed in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it
        is a stock. Just as income is recognized as a flow of money, rent too
        can (and should) be understood as such.</p>
      <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
        what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this
        more than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone
        has since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended
        by human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates
        to land. Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic
        location for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly
        use. Regardless whether those who acquire title to such sites use them
        to the full extent of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations
        is commensurate with their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill
        more than a century ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in
        their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase in
        the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
        should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
        title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free
        lunch&#8221; to opportunistically situated titleholders. When offered
        for sale, the projected rental value is capitalized in the present value
        for purposes of attaching a market price and sold as a commodity. Yet
        simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s
        creation. Moreover, <strong>the failure to recover the land rent connected
        to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities in our economy,
        and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight
        loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</strong></p>
      <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production
        not created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy
        or sell as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a
        century earlier, &#8220;The earth belongs in usufruct to the living;
        . . . [It is] given as a common stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35
        This passage likely needs a bit of parsing for the modern reader. The
        word usufruct, understood since Roman times, has almost passed from use
        today. It means &#8220;the right to use the property of another so long
        as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36 Note also that Jefferson regarded
        the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not allotted to individuals
        with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to the living&#8221; might
        be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists who, taking
        an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do not inherit
        the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
        presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a
        claim that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their
        origin ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
      <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct,
                  and the rent that derives from those sites is due to community
                  enterprise, it is not
                        a large logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s
                        recovery of that rent should be the proper source of
                        taxation. This is the Georgist
                        argument: that the recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed
                        the natural &#8211; source of taxation.38 ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
