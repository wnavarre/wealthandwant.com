<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in
        land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land
                                    in the richest of so-called Christian countries?
                    Is it not that
                                        young
                                          people fear to marry; that married
    people fear to have children; that
                                            children
                                              are
                                                driven
                                                  out of
                                                    life from sheer want of proper
                nourishment and care, or compelled to toil when they ought to
                    be at school or at
                                        play; that great
                                            numbers of
                                                  those who
                                                    attain maturity enter it
    with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves, undeveloped minds &#8212; under
                                      conditions that foredoom them, not merely
            to suffering, but to crime;
                                          that fit them in
                                                advance for the
                                                prison and
                                                    the brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!

<blockquote>
  <p>WHEN we speak of a community increasing in wealth we do not mean to say that
  there is more land, or that the natural powers of the land are greater, or
  that there are more people (for when we wish to express that idea we speak
  of increase of population) or that the debts or dues owing by some of these
  people to others of their number have increased; but we mean that there is
  an increase of certain tangible things, having an actual and not merely a relative
  value &#8212; such as buildings, cattle, tools, machinery, agricultural and
  mineral products, manufactured goods, ships, wagons, furniture and the like.
  . . . The common character of these things is that they consist of natural
  substances or products which have been adapted by human labor to human use
  or gratification, their value depending on the amount of labor which upon the
  average would be required to produce things of like kind.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
WEALTH is not the sole object of labor, for labor is also expended in ministering
directly to desire; but it is the object and result of what we call productive
labor &#8212; that is, labor which gives value to material things. Nothing which
nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth, nor yet does the expenditure
of labor result in wealth unless there is a tangible product which has and retains
the power of ministering to desire. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
IT will be well for a moment to consider this idea of accumulated wealth. The
truth is, that wealth can be accumulated but to a slight degree, and that communities
really live, as the vast majority of individuals live, from hand to mouth. Wealth
will not bear much accumulation; except in a few unimportant forms it will not
keep. The matter of the universe, which, when worked up by labor into desirable
forms, constitutes wealth, is constantly tending back to its original state.
Some forms of wealth will last for a few hours, some for a few days, some for
a few months, some for a few years; and there are very few forms of wealth that
can be passed from one generation to another. Take wealth in some of its most
useful and permanent forms &#8212; ships, houses, railways, machinery. Unless
labor is constantly exerted in preserving and renewing them, they will almost
immediately become useless. Stop labor in any community, and wealth would vanish
almost as the jet of a fountain vanishes when the flow of water is shut off.
Let labor again exert itself, and wealth will almost as immediately reappear.
Accumulated wealth seems to play just about such a part in relation to the social
organism as accumulated nutriment does to the physical organism. Some accumulated
wealth is necessary, and to a certain extent it may be drawn upon in exigencies;
but the wealth produced by past generations can no more account for the consumption
of the present than the dinners he ate last year can supply a man with present
strength. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html"> &#8212; Book
