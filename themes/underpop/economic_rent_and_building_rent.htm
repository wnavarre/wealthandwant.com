<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Rent&quot; as economists use the term (those whose education is moderately
      complete)  and as landlords and tenants use the term are
      very different phenomena.</p>
  <p>Real estate investors are just as happy to accept the &quot;polite fiction&quot; that
      land has little or no value, and that the value of their holdings is mostly
      in the buildings.</p>
  <p>But the reality, particularly for buildings that aren't quite new, is that
      the value of the site on which the building sits is frequently more than 50%
      of the total property value. Buildings depreciate every year. Land appreciates,
      due to population increases, public investment in infrastructure and services,
      and technological progress.</p>
  <p>Most cities' assessments don't acknowledge this. Assessments are done infrequently
      (Connecticut requires every 4 years; there are counties  in Pennsylvania
      which haven't been assessed in decades; California's and Florida's assessments
      have little consistent relation to reality due to assessment caps.</p>

          <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the
              present system and the single tax, for large amounts of real estate
              are exempt from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth,
              by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by
              charitable, literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount
              of the value of land so held as returned by the assessors for the year
              1892 is $60,626,171.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should
              be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of the public
              burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here. There is
              good reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
              to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an
              indication of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
              October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were
              valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report) at
              $52,712,600. I believe that this represents not more than fifty per
              cent of their true market value.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property
              and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think $500,000,000
              to be a fair estimate of the land values of Boston. Making this the
              basis of contrast, we have:</font></p>

        <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
      <p>The chart on the following page displays the fundamental principle of
        Production, which we considered at the beginning, and also the fundamental
        principle of Distribution, which is yet to be considered. In the development
        of the latter will be found the explanation of the divorce in the civilized
        state of Labor from Land: [chart]</p>
      <p>        This chart reminds us that Labor (human exertion), by application to
          Land (natural materials and forces external to man), produces Wealth
          (the generic term for all those things that tend to satisfy the material
          Wants of man), and so tends to abolish poverty. No man's poverty can
          be abolished in any other way, unless it be by gifts, or vulgar robbery,
          or legalized spoils.</p>
      <p>The chart shows also that Wealth distributes ultimately in Wages 82
                        (a fund made up of the aggregate of the earnings of individual laborers),
                        which corresponds to Labor; and Rent 83 (a fund made up of the aggregate
                        premiums for specially desirable locations), which corresponds to Land.84</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">82. &quot;What is paid for labor of any kind is called wages. We are
              apt to speak of the payment given to the common day laborer only as wages;
              and we give finer names to the payments which are made for some other
              kinds of services. Thus we speak of the doctor's or the lawyer's fee;
              of the judge's salary; of the teacher's income; of the merchant's profit;
              of the banker's interest, and of the professor's emoluments. They are
              all in reality only payments for labor of different kinds, or for different
              results of labor, &#8212; that is, they are all wages.&quot; &#8212; Dick's
            Outlines, p. 23</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;Wages is what goes to pay for all the trouble of labor.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
            Primer, sec. 39</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;His [the manager's] share is called the wages of superintendence,
              and although usually much larger than the share of a common laborer,
            it is really wages of the same nature.&quot; &#8212; Id., sec. 41.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The common meaning of the word wages is the compensation paid
              to a hired person for manual labor. But in political economy the word
              wages has a much wider meaning, and includes all returns for exertion.
              For, as political economists explain, the three agents or factors in
              production are land, labor, and capital, and that part of the produce
              which goes to the second of these factors is styled by them wages. .
              . It is important to keep this in mind. For in the standard economic
              works this sense of the term wages is recognized with greater or less
              clearness only to be subsequently ignored.&quot; &#8212; Progress
            and Poverty, book i, ck. ii.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">83. Rent &quot;is what is paid for the use of a natural agent, whether
              land, or beds of minerals, or rivers, or lakes. The rent of a house or
              factory is, therefore, not all rent in our meaning of the word.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
            Primer, sec. 40.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The term rent in its economic sense . . . differs
              in meaning from the word rent as commonly used. In some respects
              this economic
            meaning
            is narrower than the common meaning; in other respects it is wider.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is narrower in this: In common speech, we apply the word rent
              to payments for the use of buildings, machinery, fixtures, etc., as well
              as to payments for the use of land or other natural capabilities; and
              in speaking of the rent of a house or the rent of a farm, we do not separate
              the price for the use of the improvements from the price for the use
              of the bare land. But in the economic meaning of rent, payments for the
              use of any of the products of human exertion are excluded, and of the
              lumped payments for the use of houses, farms, etc., only that part is
              rent which constitutes the consideration for the use of the land &#8212; that
              part paid for the use of buildings or other improvements being properly
            interest, as it is a consideration for the use of capital.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is wider in this: In common speech we only
              speak of rent when owner and user are distinct persons. But in the
              economic sense
            there
              is also rent where the same person is both owner and user. Where
            owner and user are thus the same person, whatever part of his income
            he might
              obtain by letting the land to another is rent, while the return for
            his labor and capital are that part of his income which they would
            yield
              him did he hire instead of owning the land. Rent is also expressed
            in a selling price. When land is purchased, the payment which is made
            for
              the ownership, or right to perpetual use, is rent commuted or capitalized.
              If I buy land for a small price and hold it until I can sell it for
            a large price, I have become rich, not by wages for my labor or by
            interest
            upon my capital, but by the increase of rent.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;Rent, in short, is the share in the wealth produced which the
              exclusive right to the use of natural capabilities gives to the owner.
              Wherever land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
              of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or
              hirer, there is rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a
              value, there is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent
              which gives value to land. Until its ownership will confer some advantage,
              land has no value.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iii,
            chap ii</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">84. &quot;The primary division of wealth in distribution is dual, not
              tripartite. Capital is but a form of labor, and its distinction from
              labor is in reality but a subdivision, just as the division of labor
              into skilled and unskilled would be. In our examination we have reached
              the same point as would have been attained had we simply treated capital
              as a form of labor, and sought the law which divides the produce between
              rent and wages; that is to say, between the possessors of the two factors,
              natural substances and powers, and human exertion &#8212; which two factors
              by their union produce all wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
            book iii, ch. v.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">Care must be taken not to confuse the hire of a
              house, commonly and legally termed &quot;rent,&quot; with economic
              Rent. House rent is really Wages; it is compensation for the labor
              of house
              building.
              But economic
              Rent is not compensation for anything; it is simply the premiums
            for advantages of location. </font>... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Q3. What is meant by economic rent?</em><br>
        A. Gross ground rent -- the annual site value of land -- what land, including
          any quality or content of the land itself, is worth annually for use
          -- what the land does or would command for use per annum if offered
          in open market -- the annual value of the exclusive use in control
          of a given area of land, involving the enjoyment of those &quot;rights
          and privileges thereto pertaining&quot; which are stipulated in every
          title deed, and which, enumerated specifically, are as follows: right
        and ease of access to</p>

      <p>utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the character
        of the government; which collectively constitute the economic and social
        advantages of the land which are due to the presence and activity of
        population, and are inseparable therefrom, including the benefit of proximity
        to, and command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the
        world -- an artificial value created primarily through public expenditure
        of taxes. For the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may
        be conveniently expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is
        ordinarily measured by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>
      <p><em>Q9. Does not the single tax mean the nationalization of land?</em><br>
A. No; as Henry George has said, &quot;the primary error of the advocates of
land nationalization is in their confusion of equal rights with joint rights.
... In truth, the right to the use of land is not a joint or common right, but
an equal right; a joint or common right is to rent.&quot;* It means rather the
socialization of economic rent. It simply proposes gradually to divert an increasing
share of ground rent into the public treasury.<br>
