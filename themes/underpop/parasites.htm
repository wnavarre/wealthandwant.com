<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
    this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
    And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
    he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
    thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
    of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
    the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
    desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
    owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
    purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
    and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
    because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
    seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
    to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
    to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
    sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
    But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
    in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
    own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more independent
    farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on their mortgages.
    So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
    wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
    slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
  which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.... <a href="../../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>
