    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</strong><br />
          <br />
  To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
  service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and
  now, in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in
  proportion to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government
  must use land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government
  is poor to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits
  of good government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many
  and fully enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government
  are available, or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest
  and most available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would
  work or live where the benefits of government are available, and does not already
  own land there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other
  things being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that
  the site he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service
  of government in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public
  which provides the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor
            government than in any country of better government, other things
            being equal. They are lower in cities of poor government, other things
            being equal, than in cities of better government. Land values are
            lower, for example, in Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande,
            where government is bad, than in El Paso, the neighboring city on
            the American side, where government is better. They are lower in
            the same city under bad government than under improved government.
            When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was elected mayor of Brooklyn,
            N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath of office, upon the
            bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal abuses. Let the
            city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through it and
            sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
            rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation
            of wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent
            land has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public
            improvements might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able
            to recall some within his own experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be
            so. Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
            in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
            of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land
            can not be reproduced.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
            are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very
            bold man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such
            a community and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should
            appear. His store costs him more than the same building would cost
            in a civilized community; mechanics are not plentiful in such a place,
            and materials are hard to get. The building is finally erected, however,
            and stocked. And now what about this merchant's prices for goods?
            Competition is weak, because there are few men who will take the
            chances he has taken, and he charges all that his customers will
            pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per cent, perhaps one or two
            thousand per cent profit rewards him for his pains and risk. His
            goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough to satisfy the
            most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should wish
            to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
            the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is
            the type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
            and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
            you know!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient
            administration of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life
            and property are safe. What about prices then? It would no longer
            require a bold or desperately avaricious man to engage in selling
            goods in that community, and competition would set in. High profits
            would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as cheap as anywhere
            in the world, the cost of transportation considered. Builders and
            building materials could be had without difficulty, and stores would
            be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement in government
            increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
        to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common
        government points to the true method of taxation. With the exception
        of such other monopoly property as is analogous to land titles, and which
        in the purview of the single tax is included with land for purposes of
        taxation, 15 land is the only kind of property that is increased in value
        by government; and the increase of value is in proportion, other influences
        aside, to the public service which its possession secures to the occupant.
        Therefore, by taxing land in proportion to its value, and exempting all
        other property, kindred monopolies excepted &#8212; that is to say, by
        adopting the single tax &#8212; we should be levying taxes according
        to benefits.16</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
            thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of
            sovereign authority they confer rights of control for transportation
            purposes over narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading
            points. The value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
            of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
            and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The
            landlord would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred
            upon him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his
            holding. And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly
            according to the value of his land for all the public benefits he
            enjoyed, both intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
        taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise
        against the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems
        of taxation they are exempt. 17 <strong>Even the poorest and the most
        degraded classes in the community, besides paying land-owners for such
        public
        benefits as come their way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute
        to the support of government. But landowners as a class go free. They
        enjoy the protection of the courts, and of police and fire departments,
        and they have the use of schools and the benefit of highways and other
        public improvements, all in common with the most favored, and upon the
        same specific terms; yet, though they go through the form of paying taxes,
        and if their holdings are of considerable value pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on
        all important occasions, they, in effect and considered as a class, pay
        no taxes, because government, by increasing the value of their land,
        enables them to recover back in higher rents and higher prices more than
        their taxes amount to.</strong> Enjoying the same tangible benefits of government
        that others do, many of them as individuals and all of them as a class
        receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit which government confers
        upon no other property-owners. The value of their property is enhanced
        in proportion to the benefits of government which its occupants enjoy.
        To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against them; it
        is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington
            were paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a
            Congressional Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate
            Tax Assessments in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs.
            Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman, Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington,
            of Tennessee. Made to the House of Representatives, May 24, 1892.
            Report No. 1469</em>), brought out the fact that the value of their
            land had been increasing at a minimum rate of ten per cent per annum.
            The Washington land-owners as a class thus appear to have received
            back in higher land values, actually and potentially, about ten dollars
            for every two dollars that as land-owners they paid in taxes. If
            any one supposes that this condition is peculiar to Washington let
            him make similar estimates for any progressive locality, and see
            if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the
            capitalized value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its
            owner an income in the nature of actual or potential ground rent,
            then to the extent that this actual or possible income is dependent
            upon government the landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No
            matter what tax he pays on account of his ownership of land, the
            public gives it back to him to that extent.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
            government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
            respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence
            and find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity
            of illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
            but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have
            selected and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
            exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
            for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
            if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down;
            they have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be
            'held up' and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out
            in the spring, your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs,
            and if you walk you may break your legs and will be lucky if you
            don t break your neck; they have no street pavements and their sidewalks
            are dangerously out of repair. When the moon doesn't shine the streets
            are in darkness, for they have no street lights. The water you need
            for your house you must get from a well; there is no water supply
            there. Now in our town it is different. We have a splendid fire department,
            and the best police force in the world. Our streets are macadamized,
            and lighted with electricity; our sidewalks are always in first class
            repair; we have a water system that equals that of New York; and
            in every way the public benefits in this town are unsurpassed. It
            is the best governed town in all this region. Isn't it worth a hundred
            and fifty dollars a year more for a building site here than over
            in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
            But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,
            what would be the conversation if your sense of the fitness of things
            were not warped by familiarity with false systems of taxation? Would
            it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
            the assessor. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
            your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
            for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire
            department? Are not you protected from robbery by the best police
            force in the world? Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements,
            and good sidewalks, and electric street lights, and a first class
            water supply? Don't you suppose these things cost something? And
            don't you think you ought to pay your share?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"><strong>&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or
              less calmness; &quot;I
            do have the benefit of these things, and I do think that I ought
            to pay my share toward supporting them. But I have already paid my
            share for this year. I have paid it to the owner of this lot. He
            charges me two hundred and fifty dollars a year -- one hundred and
            fifty dollars more than I should pay or he could get but for those
            very benefits. <em>He</em> has collected my share of this year's
            expense of maintaining town improvements; you go and collect from
            him. If you do not, but insist upon collecting from me, I shall be
            paying twice for these things, once to him and once to you; and he
            won't be paying at all, but will be making money out of them, although
            he derives the same benefits from them in all other respects that
            I do.&quot;</strong> </font></p>

    <blockquote>George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to
      which every human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land
      was fixed in supply, the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy
      few to enjoy exclusive rights to land and its benefits, while alienating
      the poorer majority from land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to
      landowners in order to access this necessary resource. Moreover, <strong>the
      collection of rents by landowners allowed them to increase their wealth
      without contributing
      to the productive efforts of society</strong>. As the population grew, so too did
      the demand for land, forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition,
      increases in land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such
      as roads and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the
      expense of the community. Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged
      speculation in land, pushing prices even higher, while exposing the economy
      to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts.&#8217;... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read
