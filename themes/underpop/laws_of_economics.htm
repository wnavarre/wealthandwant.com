    <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Laws of Social Life <br>
        <br>
    </span> TAKE now some hard-headed businessman, who has no theories, but knows
    how to make money. Say to him: "Here is a little village; in ten years it
    will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad will have taken the
    place of the stagecoach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound
    with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective
    power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be any higher?" <br>
        <br>
He will tell you, "No!" <br>
<br>
"Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a man who
has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?" <br>
        <br>
He will tell you, "No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher; on the
contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not be easier
for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are that it will
be harder." <br>
        <br>
"What, then, will be higher?" " Rent; the value of land. Go; get yourself a piece
of ground, and hold possession." <br>
        <br>
And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more.
You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni of
Naples or the leperos of Mexico: you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole in
the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota to
the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you
may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an almshouse. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

THERE may be disputes as to whether there is yet a science of political economy,
that is to say, whether our knowledge of the natural economic laws is as yet
so large and well digested as to merit the title of science. But among those
who recognize that the world we live in is in all its spheres governed by law,
there can be no dispute as to the possibility of such a science. &#8212; <em>The

THE domain of law is not confined to physical nature. It just as certainly embraces
the mental and moral universe, and social growth and social life have their laws
as fixed as those of matter and of motion. Would we make social life healthy
and happy, we must discover those laws, and seek our ends in accordance with
them. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp22.html">Social

    <blockquote>
      <p>Wealth is produced solely by the application of Labor to Land.51</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">50. It may at first seem like a great waste of time
            and space to have gone through this long analysis for no other purpose
            at last than to demonstrate the self-evident fact that land and labor
            are the sole original factors in the production of Wealth. But it
            will have been no waste if it enables the reader to firmly grasp
            the fact. Nothing is more obvious, to be sure. Nothing is more readily
            assented to. Yet by layman and college professor and economic author
            alike, this simple truth is cast adrift at the very threshold of
            argument or investigation, with results akin to what might be expected
            in physics if after recognizing the law of gravitation its effects
            should be completely ignored.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">51. There is ample authority among economic writers
            for this conclusion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Professor Ely enumerates Nature, Labor, and Capital
            as the factors of production, but he describes Capital as a combination
            of Nature and Labor &#8212; Ely's Introduction, part ii, ch. iii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Say describes industry as &quot; nothing more or less
            than human employment of natural agents.&quot; &#8212; Say's Trea.,
            book i, ch. ii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">And though John Stuart Mill and numerous others speak
            of Land, Labor, and Capital as the three factors of production, as
            does Professor Jevons, most of them, like Jevons, recognize the fact,
            though in their reasoning they often fail to profit by it, that Capital
            is not a primary but a secondary requisite. See Jevons's Pol. Ec.,
            secs. 16, 19.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Henry George says: &quot;Land, labor, and capital
            are the factors of production. The term land includes all natural
            opportunities or forces; the term labor, all human exertion; and
            the term capital, all wealth used to produce more wealth. . . Capital
            is not a necessary factor in production. Labor exerted upon land
            can produce wealth without the aid of capital, and in the necessary
            genesis of things must so produce wealth before capital can exist.&quot; &#8212; Progress
            and Poverty, book iii, ch. i.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Also : &quot;The complexities of production in the
            civilized state, in which so great a part is borne by exchange, and
            so much labor is bestowed upon materials after they have been separated
            from the land, though they may to the unthinking disguise, do not
            alter the fact that all production is still the union of the two
            factors, land and labor.&quot;&#8212; Id., ch. viii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">By intelligent observers no authority is needed. In
                                                      all the phenomena of human life, whether primitive or civilized,
                                                      the lesson of the chart stands out in bold relief. Nothing can be
                                                      produced without Labor and Land, and nothing can be named which under
                                                      any circumstances enters into productive processes that is not resolvable
                                                      into either the one or the other. To satisfy all human wants mankind
                                                      requires nothing but human labor and natural material, and each of
                                                      them is indispensable.</font></p>
