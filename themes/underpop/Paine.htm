<p>Thomas Paine, quoted by James Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
    Policy</a>&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The earth, in its natural state &#8230; is supporting but a small
    number of inhabitants, compared with what it is capable of doing in a cultivated
    state.
      And impossible to separate the improvement made by cultivation from the
    earth itself upon which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property
    arose
      from that inseparable connection; but it is nevertheless true that it is
    value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is individual
    property.
      Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated land owes to the community a
    ground-rent, for I know no better term to express the idea by, for the land
    which he holds. &#8230;Cultivation
      is one of the greatest natural improvements ever made. . . .But the landed
      monopoly that began with it has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants
      of every nation of their natural inheritance.&quot; [Thomas Paine, Agrarian
  Justice, 1797]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with some elision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The earth, in its natural, uncultivated state was, and ever would have
      continued to be, the common property of the human race.&quot; As the land gets
      cultivated, &quot;it is the value of the improvement, only, and not the earth
      itself, that is in individual property. Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated
      lands, owes to the community a ground-rent..to every person, rich or poor...because
      it is in lieu of the natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every
      man, over and above the property he may have created, or inherited from those
      who did&quot; - Thomas Paine 1796, p. 611; 612-613</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One observer of this transformation was Thomas Paine, America&#8217;s pro-independence
    pamphleteer. Seeing how enclosure of the commons benefited a few and disinherited
    many others, Paine proposed a remedy &#8212; not a reversal of enclosure,
    which he considered necessary for economic reasons, but compensation for
    it.</p>
  <p>Like Locke, Paine believed nature was a gift of God to all. &#8220;There
    are two kinds of property,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Firstly, natural property,
    or that which comes to us from the Creator of the universe &#8212; such as
    the earth, air, water. Secondly, artificial or acquired property &#8212; the
    invention of men.&#8221; In the latter, he went on, equality is impossible,
    but in the former, &#8220;all individuals have legitimate birthrights.&#8221; Since
    such birthrights were diminished by enclosure, there ought to be an &#8220;indemnification
    for that loss.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Paine therefore proposed a &#8220;national fund&#8221; that would do two
    things:</p>
  <p>[Pay] to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the
    sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of
    his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed
    property: And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every
    person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall
    arrive at that age.</p>
  <p>A century and a half later, America created a national fund to do part of
    what Paine recommended &#8212; we call it Social Security. We&#8217;ve yet
    to adopt the other part, but its basic principle &#8212; that enclosure of
    a commons requires compensation &#8212; is as sound in our time as it was
    in Paine&#8217;s. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>TO PRESERVE the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy
    at the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to be considered
    as one of the first objects of reformed legislation.</p>
  <p>Whether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called civilization,
    has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of man, is a question
    that may be strongly contested. On one side, the spectator is dazzled by
    splendid appearances; on the other, he is shocked by extremes of wretchedness;
    both of which it has erected. The most affluent and the most miserable of
    the human race are to be found in the countries that are called civilized.</p>
  <p>To understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to
    have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is at
    this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in that state,
    any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want present to
    our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe.</p>
  <p><strong>Poverty, therefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilized
    life. It exists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the natural
    state is without those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts, science
    and manufacturers.</strong></p>
  <p>The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of
    Europe; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared to the
    rich. <strong>Civilization, therefore, or that which is so called, has operated two
    ways: to make one part of society more affluent, and the other more wretched,
    than would have been the lot of either in a natural state.</strong></p>
  <p>It is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, but
    it is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. The reason
    is that <strong>man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires ten times
    the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance, than would
    support him in a civilized state, where the earth is cultivated.</strong></p>
  <p>When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation,
    art and science, there is a necessity of preserving things in that state;
    because without it there cannot be sustenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth
    part of its inhabitants. <strong>The thing, therefore, now to be done is to remedy
    the evils and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society by passing
    from the natural to that which is called the civilized state.</strong></p>
  <p>In taking the matter upon this ground,<em><strong> the first principle of civilization
    ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the condition of every person
    born into the world, after a state of civilization communities, ought not
    to be worse than it he had been born before that period.</strong></em></p>
  <p>But the fact is that the condition of millions, in every country in Europe,
    is far worse than if they had been born before civilization began, or had
    been born among the Indians of North America at the present day. I will show
    how this fact has happened.</p>
  <p>It is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural,
    uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the common
    property of the human race. In that state every man would have been born
    to property.
    He would have been a joint life proprietor with the rest in the property
    of the soil, and in all its natural productions, vegetable and animal.</p>
  <p>But the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of supporting
    but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing
    in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to separate the improvement
    made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that improvement is
    made, the idea of landed property arose from that inseparable connection;
    but it is nevertheless true, that it is the value of the improvement, only,
    and not the earth itself, that is individual property.</p>
  <p>Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated lands, owes to the community
    a ground-rent (for I know of no better term to express the idea) for the
    land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent that the fund proposed
    in this plan is to issue.</p>
  <p>It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the histories
    transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced with cultivation,
    and that there was no such thing as landed property before that time. It
    could not exist in the first state of man, that of hunters. It did not exist
    in the second state, that of shepherds: neither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor
    Job, so far as the history of the Bible may be credited in probable things,
    were owners of land.</p>
  <p>Their property consisted, as is always enumerated in flocks and herds, and
    they traveled with them from place to place. The frequent contentions at
    that time about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia, where those
    people lived, also show that there was no landed property. It was not admitted
    that land could be claimed as property.</p>
  <p>There could be no such thing at landed property originally. Man did not
    make the earth, and though he had a natural right to occupy it, he had no
    right to locate as his property in perpetuity any part of it; neither did
    the Creator of the earth open a land-office, from whence the first title-deeds
    should issue. Whence then, arose the idea of landed property? I answer as
    before, that when cultivation began the idea of landed property began with
    it, from the impossibility or separating the improvement made by cultivation
    from the earth itself, upon which that improvement was made.</p>
  <p>The value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the natural earth,
    at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the end, the common right of all
    became confounded into the cultivated right of the individual. But there
    are, nevertheless, distinct species of rights, and will continue to be, so
    long as the earth endures.</p>
  <p>It is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful ideas
    of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover the boundary that
    divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know his own. I have entitled
    this tract &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;Agrarian
    Law.&quot;</p>
  <p>Nothing could be more unjust than agrarian law in a country improved by
    cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant of the earth, is a joint
    proprietor of it in its natural state, it does not follow that he is a joint
    proprietor of cultivated earth. The additional value made by cultivation,
    after the system was admitted, became the property of those who did it, or
    who inherited ii from them, or who purchased it. It had originally no owner.
    While, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest myself in the hard case
    of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the
    introduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend the right
    of the possessor to the part which is his.</p>
  <p>Cultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever made
    by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value. But the
    landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest evil. It has
    dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their natural
    inheritance, without providing for them, as ought to have been done, an indemnification
    for that loss, and has thereby created a species of poverty and wretchedness
    that did not exist before.</p>
  <p>In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,
    and not a charity, that I am pleading for. Nor it is that kind of right which,
    being neglected at first, could not he brought forward afterwards till heaven
    had opened the way by a revolution in the system of government. Let us then
    do honor to revolutions by justice, and give currency to their principles
    by blessings.</p>
  <p>Having thus in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now proceed
    to the plan I have to propose, which is,</p>
  <p>To create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person,
    when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling,
    as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance,
    by the introduction of the system of landed property:</p>
  <p>And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person
    now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive
    at that age.</p>
  <p><strong>Means By Which The Fund Is To Be Created</strong></p>
  <p>I have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in its
    natural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the
    common property of the human race; that in that state, every person would
    have been born to property; and that the system of landed property, by its
    inseparable connection with cultivation, and with what is called civilized
    life, has absorbed the property of all those whom it dispossessed, without
    providing as ought to have been done, an indemnification for that loss.</p>
  <p>The fault, however, is not in the present possessors. No complaint is intended,
    or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the crime by opposing
    justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen imperceptibly upon
    the world, aided afterwards by the agrarian law of the sword. But the fault
    can be made to reform itself by successive generations; and without diminishing
    or deranging the property of any of the present possessors, the operation
    of the fund can yet commence, and be in full activity, the first year of
    its establishment, or soon after, as I shall show.</p>
  <p>It is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every person,
    rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious distinctions.
    It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of the natural inheritance,
    which, as a right, belongs to every man, over and above the property he may
    have created, or inherited from those who did. Such persons as do not choose
    to receive it can throw it into the common fund.</p>
  <p>Taking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse condition
    when born under what is called a state of civilization, than he would have
    been had he been born in a state of nature, and that civilization ought to
    have made, and ought still to make, provision for that purpose, it can only
    be done by subtracting from property a portion equal in value to the natural
    inheritance it has absorbed.</p>
  <p>Various methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which appears
    to be the best (not only because it will operate without deranging any present
    possessors, or without interfering with the collection of taxes or emprunts
    necessary for the purposes of government and the Revolution, but because
    it will be the least troublesome and the most effectual, and also because
    the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits it) is at the moment
    that property is passing by the death of one person to the possession of
    another. In this case, the bequeather gives nothing: the receiver pays nothing.
    The only matter to him is that the monopoly of natural inheritance, to which
    there never was a right, begins to cease in his person. A generous man would
    not wish it to continue, and a just man will rejoice to see it abolished.</p>
  <p>My state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with respect
    to the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to round calculations with such
    degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I offer on
    this head is more the result of observation and reflection than of received
    information; but I believe it will be found to agree sufficiently with fact.
    In the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity, all
    the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in the possession
    of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know, as a datum of calculation,
    the average of years which persons above that age will live. I take this
    average to be about thirty years, for though many persons will live forty,
    fifty, or sixty years, after the age of twenty-one years, others will die
    much sooner, and some in every year of that time.</p>
  <p>Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without
    any material variation one way or other, the average of time in which the
    whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will have
    passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will have gone
    by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances, some parts of
    this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in the possession of
    one person, other parts will have revolved two or three times before those
    thirty years expire, which will bring it to that average; for were one-half
    the capital of a nation to revolve twice in thirty years, it would produce
    the same fund as if the whole revolved once.</p>
  <p>Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole capital
    of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the thirtieth part
    thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year, that is, will go by
    deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being thus known, and the ratio
    per cent to be subtracted from it determined, it will give the amount or
    income of the proposed fund, to be applied as already mentioned.</p>
  <p>In looking over the discourse of the English Minister, Pitt, in his opening
    of what is called in England the budget (the scheme of finance for the year
    1796), I find an estimate of the national capital of that country. As this
    estimate or a national capital is prepared ready to my hand, I take it as
    a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon the known capital of
    any nation, combined with its population, it will serve as a scale for any
    other nation, in proportion as its capital and population be more or less.</p>
  <p>I am the more disposed to take this estimate of Mr. Pitt, for the purpose
    of showing to that minister, upon his own calculation, how much better money
    may be employed than in wasting it, as he has done, on the wild project of
    setting up Bourbon kings. What, in the name of heaven, are Bourbon kings
    to the people of England? It is better that the people have bread.</p>
  <p>Mr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal, to be
    one thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about one fourth part
    of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The event of the last
    harvest in each country proves that the soil of France is more productive
    than that of England, and that it can better support twenty-four or twenty-five
    millions of inhabitants than that of England can seven or seven and a half
    millions.</p>
  <p>The thirtieth part of this capital of &pound;1,300,000,000 is &pound;43,333,333
    which is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country
    to new
    possessors; and the sum that will annually revolve in France in the proportion
    of four to one, will be about one hundred and seventy-three millions sterling.
    From this sum of &pound; 43,333,333 annually revolving, is to be subtracted
    the value of the natural inheritance absorbed in it, which, perhaps, in fair
    justice, cannot be taken at less, and ought not to be taken for more, than
    a tenth part.</p>
  <p>It will always happen that of the property thus revolving by deaths every
    year a part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters, and the
    other part collaterally, and the proportion will he found to be about three
    to one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will descend to direct
    heirs, and the remaining sum of &pound; 13,333,333 to more distant relations,
    and in part to strangers.</p>
  <p>Considering, then, that man is always related to society, that relationship
    will become comparatively greater proportion as the next of kin is more distant;
    it is therefore consistent with civilization to say that where there are
    no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part over and above the tenth
    part due to society.</p>
  <p>If this additional part be from five to ten or twelve per cent, in proportion
    as the next of kin be nearer or more remote, so as to average with the escheats
    that may fall, which ought always to go to society and not to the government
    (an addition of ten per cent more), the produce from the annual sum of &pound; 43,333,333
    will be:</p>
  <p>From &pound; 30,000,000 at ten per cent	&pound; 3,000,000<br>
    From &pound; 13,333,333 at ten per cent with the addition of ten percent
    more	&pound; 2,666,666<br>
    &pound; 43,333,333	&pound;5,666,666</p>
  <p>Having thus arrived at the annual amount or the proposed fund, I come, in
    the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this fund and
    to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be applied.</p>
  <p>The population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven millions and
    a half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in that case
    be about four hundred thousand. There would not, however, he more than that
    number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling per annum, though
    they would he entitled to it. I have no idea it would be accepted by many
    persons who had a yearly income of two or three hundred pounds sterling.
    But as we often see instances of rich people falling into sudden poverty,
    even at the age of sixty, they would always have the right of drawing all
    the arrears due to them. Four millions, therefore, of the above annual sum
    of &pound;5,666,666 will be required for four hundred thousand aged persons,
    ten pounds sterling each.</p>
  <p>I come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one years
    of age. If all the persons who died were above the age of twenty-one years,
    the number of persons annually arriving at that age must be equal to the
    annual number of deaths, to keep the population stationary. But the greater
    part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the number of persons
    annually arriving at twenty-one will be less than half the number of deaths.</p>
  <p>The whole number of deaths upon a population of seven millions and a half
    will be about 220,000 annually. The number arriving at twenty-one years of
    age will be about 100,000. The whole number of these will not receive the
    proposed fifteen pounds, for the reasons already mentioned, though, as in
    the former case, they would be entitled to it. Admitting then that a tenth
    part declined receiving it, the amount would stand thus:<br>
    Fund annually	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound; 5,666,666 <br>
    To 400,000 aged persons at L10 each	&pound; 4,000,000 <br>
    To 90,000 persons of 21 yrs., L15 ster. each	&pound; 1,350,000 <br>
    --	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound; 5,350,000 <br>
    Remains	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound; 316,666 </p>
  <p>There are. in every country, a number blind and lame persons totally incapable
    of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen that the greater number
    of blind persons will be among those who are above the age of fifty years,
    they will be provided for in that class. The remaining sum of L316,666 will
    provide for the lame and blind under that age, at the same rate of L10 annually
    for each person. </p>
