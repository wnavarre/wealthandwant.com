<blockquote>
  <p>George Reisman advocates what might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conservative
    classical liberalism</span>." This position is that certainty in property
    rights is so valuable that one should never ask whether unjustifiable violence
    was used
    in establishing the existing pattern of control
    over natural opportunities.</p>
  <p>Every natural opportunity belongs to whoever most recently succeeded in establishing
    control over it.</p>
  <p>Murray Rothbard, by contrast, took what might be called the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading
        libertarian</span>" position. This is the position that when we can know
        who first used a natural opportunity, it belongs to that person, or to
        his or her successor in title through gift and exchange. All thefts from
        victims
        with identifiable successors should be undone. When we cannot identify
        the proper successor of the first user, the a thing belongs to whoever
        is using
        it now, unless that person stole it, in which case it properly belongs
        to whoever brings the thief to justice.</p>
  <p>The third position, which might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoliberalism</span>" emerges from the work of Henry
      George. This is the position that all persons have equal rights to natural
      opportunities, which rights should be secured by having the public treasury
      collect the rental value of exclusive access to land and other natural
    opportunities, with the revenue used for public purposes and guaranteed incomes.</p>
  <p>Of these three approaches, I find geoliberalism most attractive. It fits my
    sense of justice that all persons should have equal rights to natural opportunities.
    In addition, by providing funding for guaranteed incomes, geoliberalism offers
    a greater prospect for removing more of the distorting taxes that finance the
    welfare state.</p>
  <p>A possible difficulty with classical liberalism as a justification for government
    action is that it may justify little if any government action. Taxes intrude
    upon individual liberty. How is this intrusion to be justified? One way to
    try to get around this difficulty is by the claim that some expenditures on
    protecting individual rights are so valuable that anyone would understand that,
    for these expenditures, the reduction in individual liberty from taxation is
    less than the addition to individual liberty from the protection of individual
    rights that is possible with taxation. However, if improving the well-being
    of all citizens is the justification, then one should ask whether there is
    adequate justification for even these government actions if they do not have
    unanimous support.</p>
  <p>Supporters of government action might argue that if unanimous support were
    required, then the problem of selfish individuals holding out for greater shares
    of the surplus would raise transactions costs to the point where nothing could
    be done, even if there were things that would make everyone better off. But
    that justification carries the risk of justifying nearly anything. If those
    in power have an excuse to ignore what citizens say about what they value,
    what limits to power are there?</p>
  <p>Geoliberalism offers a different way of justifying public spending and the
    taxation that finances it. If people are perfectly mobile, and if there are
    enough people who value a local public good to fill the area that benefits
    from it, then the provision of a local public good will raise land rents by
    enough to pay for the public good. In collecting the rental value of land,
    governments will collect enough to pay for any worthwhile local public goods
    that they provide.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Under the conservative or homesteading libertarian
    versions of classical liberalism, the possessor of land might say, "This is
    my land. I didn't ask for these public goods. You have no right to tax me to
    pay for them." Under geoliberalism, on the other hand, the community can reply, "You
    have as much right to the use of land and other natural opportunities as
    anyone else. If you want to exercise your rights in this community, these
    are the
    taxes you must pay. If you don't like it, claim your share of natural opportunities
    somewhere else."</p>
  <p>If people are perfectly mobile and have an unlimited range of communities
    to choose among, then they cannot be exploited and need not tolerate inefficiency.
    They will move. Competing communities will find that the utility-maximizing
    public sector equilibrium involves providing all local public goods with benefits
    greater than costs, financing them by a combination of fees equal to marginal
    costs and taxes on the land that benefits from differential access to the local
    public goods. There will be no taxes on labor or capital except to internalize
    externalities.</p>
  <p>If tastes vary so much that a community cannot be filled with people with
    the same taste for local public goods, then it will not be possible to finance
    all worthwhile local public goods by the increase in rent that they generate.</p>
  <p>The community will either have to leave some worthwhile local public goods
    unprovided, or finance them from some other source. But in either case the
    residents are treated fairly if they are free to move elsewhere and choose
    not to do so. ... </p>
  <p>Of course, we are very far from public acceptance of geoliberal principles.
    So <span style="font-weight: bold;">the question arises of what might be done
    within current political understandings to reduce inefficiency and exploitation
    in taxing and spending.</span> It is hard to know how much more than what is
    being done might be done. Let me be on the imaginative
  side.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a proposal that tax increases be
      allowed only with a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress.</span> That
      has some merit, but it carries a risk of excessive deficits. It also allows
      the existing level of taxation to go unquestioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It would probably be
      better to have a rule that every spending proposal must be approved by a
      two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to be enacted. Maybe three-fourths.
      If spending is truly worthwhile, then, as Wicksell said, there is a way of
      financing it that will secure the approval of nearly everyone.</span></p>
  <p>The current trend toward returning functions to the states is a step in the
    right direction. But it encounters understandable objections that poor states
    cannot afford to do what they ought to do. Some form of revenue sharing is
    needed. But it is important to have the right definition of which states are
    rich and which are poor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The level of well-being
    in a state is determined in part by the wisdom of its public policies. </span>States
    should not be penalized for adopting productive policies.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Revenue
    sharing should equalize per capita levels of natural opportunities (mineral
    revenues, fishing rights, pre-development land rents, etc.) </span>Replacing
    the personal and corporate income taxes with either a flat income tax or a
    national sales or value added tax would greatly reduce the excess burden of
    federal taxes. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excess burden is roughly proportional
    to the square of the typical marginal tax rate.</span>) But almost all the
    gains go to the rich. Perhaps the flat tax could be combined with a guaranteed
    income.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Even better than a flat tax or a national
      sales tax, in my view, would be a return to the revenue system that was apparently
      envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution in 1787. I mean a rule that
      the federal revenue requirement would be allocated to the states in proportion
      to their populations.</span> The use of population as the allocation device
      seems anachronistic in this era of concern for impoverished regions. But
      the allocation could be corrected by an expenditure that equalized per capita
      access to natural opportunities. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read
