<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
3.0 &#8212; Chapter 9: Building the Commons Sector (pages 135-154)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    An American Permanent Fund would be the centerpiece of the new commons sector
      proposed in this volume. It&#8217;s a way to fix, or at least ameliorate,
      capitalism&#8217;s flaw of concentrating private property among the top
      5 percent of the population. It would do this, like the Alaska Permanent
      Fund, by distributing income from common property to every citizen equally.
      This would add a third set of &#8220;pipes&#8221; through which income
      would flow to Americans, the first two being wages and private property
      income.</p>
  <p>As discussed in chapter 7, the American Permanent Fund&#8217;s income would
                          come in part from the sale of pollution permits &#8212; mostly for carbon
                          dioxide &#8212; and in part from the commons&#8217; share of corporate profits.
                          The first revenue source would be directly correlated to our efforts to curb
                          global warming. If we decided to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, say, by
                          3 percent per year for the next three decades, as scientists say we must,
                          this would generate a substantial flow of income into the American Permanent
                          Fund. Some of that might be invested or spent on public goods, and some would
                          be used for per capita dividends. The faster we reduced emissions, the higher
                          these dividends would be. In effect, the dividends and public goods would
                          be a bonus to Americans for doing the right ecological thing. Eventually,
                          when a post-carbon infrastructure is built, carbon emissions would stabilize
                          at a low level, and so would this revenue source for the American Permanent
                          Fund. By this time, the second revenue source &#8212; dividends from holding
                          a portion of publicly traded corporate shares &#8212; would
                          kick in. This revenue source would give every citizen
                          a stake in increasing
                          corporate
                          profits,
                          just as the first source gives them a stake in decreasing
                          pollution. Who could object to that combination?</p>
  <p>Getting the Permanent Fund up and running, even if it starts small, would
    be a crucial precedent and signal. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, it
    would be a pipeline through which more money would flow over time. It would
    establish a fundamental principle for the commons sector &#8212; one person,
    one share. And it would change the way Americans think about our economic
    relationship with nature: every penny not paid by a polluter would be a penny
    out of everyone&#8217;s pocket. It wouldn&#8217;t be just future generations,
    then, who experience a loss when nature is degraded; the bank accounts of
    living Americans would suffer as well. Irresponsibility toward the future
    would carry an immediate and widely felt price. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To build Capitalism 3.0, we each have unique roles to play. I therefore
    address the final pages of this book to a variety of people whose participation
    is critical. ...<br>
    POLITICIANS</p>
  <p>Everyone wants your attention. Channel 5 is on line 3 and a powerful lobbyist
    is at your door. It&#8217;s hard for you to see the forest for the trees.
    What can I possibly tell you?</p>
  <p>What I want to tell you is, there&#8217;s a fork in the road. On one side
    lies capitalism as we know it; on the other, an upgrade. You must decide
    which branch to take. Your choice has vast ramifications. Very possibly,
    the fate of the planet is in your hands. Trillions of dollars are also at
    stake. I want you to be courageous. I want you to choose the upgrade.</p>
  <p>But that isn&#8217;t what one says to a politician. What one says is, we
    need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs in America, and
    protect the environment. All those things cost money, and government doesn&#8217;t
    have enough. But here&#8217;s what government can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> First, delegate to an independent authority &#8212; something like the
    Fed &#8212; the power to cap U.S. carbon consumption. That way, when energy
    prices go up (which they inevitably will), you won&#8217;t get blamed. Also,
    make sure the carbon authority pays dividends, like the Alaska Permanent
    Fund. Then, when checks are mailed to your constituents, you can take credit.</li>
  <li> Second, talk about jobs and energy independence in your speeches. And
    push for an American Permanent Fund financed by sales of pollution permits.
    Within a few years, thousands of people in your district will be installing
    new energy systems and cashing dividend checks. You&#8217;ll be a hero.</li>
  <li> Finally, tell your donors not to worry. You&#8217;re a low-tax, small-government,
    pay-as-we-go kind of person. You think the environment should be protected
    through market mechanisms. You favor an ownership society in which every
    American has a tax-deferred savings account and no child is left behind.
    ...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>What&#8217;s particularly nice about Capitalism 3.0 is that we can install
    it one piece at a time. We needn&#8217;t shut the machine down, or delete
    the old operating system, before installing the new one. Indeed, we&#8217;re
    not even replacing most of the old operating system, which is fine as it
    is. Rather, we&#8217;re attaching add-ons, or plug-ins, that allow for a
    gradual and safe transition. A formula for describing this is:</p>
  <p align="center">Corporations + Commons = Capitalism 3.0</p>
  <p>Like the governor of James Watt&#8217;s steam engine, these add-ons will
    curb our current engine&#8217;s unchecked excesses. When illth of one sort
    gets too great, the new bits of code will turn the illth valve down, or give
    authority to trustworthy humans to do so. If money circulates too unequally,
    the new code will alter the circulation, not by re distributing income but
    by pre distributing property. It will make similar adjustments when there&#8217;s
    too much corporate distortion of culture, communities, or democracy itself.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s also nice about the new operating system is that, once installed,
    it can&#8217;t be easily removed. That&#8217;s because it relies on property
    rights rather than government programs that are subject to political ebb
    and flow. If you have any doubt about this, consider the staying power of
    Social Security and the Alaska Permanent Fund, both of which distribute periodic
    payments that have attained the status of property rights. Social Security
    is over seventy years old and has never been cut once; in 2005, it survived
    a privatization campaign led by President Bush. Similarly, the Alaska Permanent
    Fund, now more than twenty-five years old, repelled an attempt in 1999 to
    divert part of its income to the state treasury. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>And, for businesspeople, here&#8217;s the best part: Capitalism 3.0 will
    preserve the driving force of American capitalism, the profit-maximizing
    algorithm. It will do this not only by leaving the algorithm alone, but also
    by giving all Americans, via the American Permanent Fund, a financial stake
    in its success. All Americans will benefit both from nature&#8217;s health
    and from the health of corporations. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
