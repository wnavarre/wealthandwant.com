<p align="center"><strong>What Percentage of Economic Rent Should We Collect?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Should we collect 100% of Rent? 95%? 90%? This question is sometimes raised
      among Georgists. There is no agreement, but most Georgists would also say
    that society would be in a far better position if this was the question we
    were
      considering &#8212; that is, if a consensus had been reached that we should
      indeed collect Rent as the underlying basis for the revenue we need to
      provide government
      services, and had begun doing so. And most of us would not quibble about
      the difference between collecting 90% and collecting 95%. Most of us would
      advocating
      something
      less than 100%,
      but likely more than 90%.</p>
  <p>Harry Pollard, of the Henry George School of Social Science in Los Angeles,
      has often said that it would be better for us to collect economic rent
    and throw it into the sea, than not to collect it at all. By this, I think
    he means that it is even more important that it not be left in private hands
    because of the mal effects of that, than that we collect it and use the revenue
    to reduce or replace some of the dumb, market-dulling taxes we currently
    use.</p>
  <p>Every dollar of economic rent we collect means a revenue dollar we don't
    need to collect from wages, or sales, or buildings. Both aspects move us
    toward a more just society and a more efficient economy</p>
  <p>Currently, we tend to collect less than 1/5 of economic rent. (At the same
      time, we collect property tax on the assessed value of buildings and other
      improvements to property. In California, with Proposition 13, some properties
      which haven't changed hands in more than 10 years see only a small fraction
      of the economic rent collected.) This is the most important explanation
    for California's high housing prices, low housing affordability, high barriers
      to entry for new businesses.</p>

  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>

    That even servitude, the worst of ills,<br />
    Because delivered down from sire to son<br />
    Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.&quot; &#8212;Cowper.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is only custom that makes the ownership of land seem
        reasonable. I have frequently had occasion to tell of the necessity under
        which the city of Cleveland, Ohio, found itself, of paying a land-owner
        several thousand dollars for the right to swing a bridge-draw over his
        land. When I described the matter in that way, the story attracted no
        attention; it seemed perfectly reasonable to the ordinary lecture audience.
        But when I described the transaction as a payment by the city to a land-owner
        of thousands of dollars for the privilege of swinging the draw &quot;through
        that man's air,&quot; the audience invariably manifested its appreciation
        of the absurdity of such an ownership. The idea of owning air was ridiculous;
        the idea of owning land was not. Yet who can explain the difference,
        except as a matter of custom?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">To the same effect was the question of the Rev. F. L.
        Higgins to a friend. While stationed at Galveston, Tex., Mr. Higgins
        fell into a discussion with his friend as to the right of government
        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Suppose,&quot; said Mr. Higgins, &quot;that the
        government should vest in a corporation title to the Gulf of Mexico,
        so that no one could fish there, or sail there, or do anything in or
        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.
        Would that be right?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, suppose the corporation should then parcel
        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Could private titles to the Gulf possibly become
        absolute in morals?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then tell me,&quot; asked Mr. Higgins, &quot;what
        difference it would make if all the water were taken off the Gulf and
        only the bare land left.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single
    Tax. 110</p>

        the famous magazine article on &quot;Who Owns the United States,&quot; estimates
        that sixty-five per cent of the present annual value of the land in the

  <p><em>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?</em><br>
    A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
      of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
      potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
      not is as yet an unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised
      from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while
      any land value remains in private possession. Until land values are exhausted
      the taxation of labor cannot be excused. </p>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would be still
    further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. </p>
  <p><em>Q16. Should the whole rental value of land be taken for common use, or only
    enough for government purposes?</em><br>
    A. Only enough for government purposes. When the people see that this method
    of taxation improves business, increases wages, cheapens land, and generally
    promotes prosperity, they will not hesitate to increase their taxes so long
    as public improvements are needed and land values are unexhausted. As is
    said in &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (book viii, ch. ii): &quot;When
    the common right to land is so far appreciated that all taxes are abolished
    save those which fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more than is
    necessary to induce them to collect the public revenues being left to individual
    landholders.&quot; </p>
  <p><em>Q33. Would not the full single tax destroy the basis of all credit &#8212; land
    values?</em><br>
    A. The full single tax &#8212; one hundred per cent of annual ground rent &#8212; would
    wipe out land values, which are but the capitalization of rent. But land
    values are not the basis of credit. Merchants do not prefer mortgages on
    land as security for commercial debts, unless they hope to get the ownership
    of the land through foreclosure. The true basis of every man's credit, from
    the consumer at the cross-roads store to the great retail merchant at the
    factory or the jobbing house, is honesty, opportunity, and ability. He who
    will pay his debts if he can, and has an opportunity to earn enough to pay
    them with, and is able to make good use of the opportunity, needs no land
    values to offer as a basis for commercial credit. He has the ideal basis
    of all credit. And this basis of credit every man could have if the single
    tax were in operation. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q10. What is the distinction between the taxation of land and the taxation
      of rent?</em><br>
A. Taxing land means, in the ordinary use of the words, to tax the land upon
its capital value, or selling value, at a given rate per $100 or $1,000 of that
value. Taxing rent means taxing the annual value, or ground rent, at a given
percentage of that rent. It is in one case a tax on rent; in the other is a tax
on capitalized rent.</p>
  <p><em>Q15. What should be the limit of revenue under the single tax?</em><br>
    A. The same as under any other system of taxation, the cost of government
      economically administered.</p>
  <p><em>Q16. Did not Henry George hold that the full ground rent of land should
    be taken in taxation?</em><br>
    A. No! Not only did he concede a margin of rent to the landlord, but as a
    matter of fact, as Thomas G. Shearman said, &quot;not all the power of all
    governments&quot; could collect in taxation all of ground rent.</p>
  <p><em>Q40. What is meant by a capitalized tax?</em><br>
A. It is a sum, the interest of which would pay the tax.</p>
  <p><em>Q62.&nbsp; Would it be wise to take gradually in taxation, say, 1/4,
      one half, or 3/4 of the future increase in economic
rent?</em><br>
A. One hundred and one professors of political
economy have answered "Yes." Twenty-nine have answered "No."<br>
<br>
<em>Q63.&nbsp; How could the single tax be put into
operation?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to land all taxes not
already on it.<br>
<br>
<em>Q64.&nbsp; How might such a plan be worked out?</em><br>
A. If fifty cents per thousand should be deducted yearly for 30 years from the
rate on all property other than land, the reduction would finally amount to $15
per thousand, and it would then
be practically exempt from all taxation.<br>
<em><br>
Q65.&nbsp; But how could it be worked out in case of
the land?</em><br>
A. Recognizing that a right thing may be done in a wrong way, it is insisted
that a right way ought to be found to do a thing that ought to be done. The following
is presented as a natural
and convenient <span style="font-style: italic;">unit of calculation</span>:
To be exact, <span style="font-style: italic;">an average of about 20 percent
of the gross ground rent of land is now taken in taxation, for instance, in Boston,
as well as for the whole state of Massachusetts. If an additional one percent
should be taken each year for 30 years, it would amount at the end of that period
to 30 percent, which, added to 20 percent, would make 50 percent, or one half,
which is about the average proportion that present taxes levied on all property
bear to gross ground rent. Meantime few landowners would feel the change, much
less be prejudiced by it.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
The following variable illustrations, A, B, and C, make clear.</p>
  <p align="center"> <span style="font-style: italic;">A "Modus Operandi"</span><br>
      <br>
  A <span style="font-style: italic;">Increase of Present Tax</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For instance, applied to the assessment of a specific lot of land for which
    the user pays a gross ground rent of say ......&nbsp; $68.00<br>
  Of which amount there is taken in taxation, 1915 ..... $18.00<br>
  <br>
  Leaving a net income to the owner of&nbsp; .... $50.00<br>
  The selling value (presumably also the assessed valuation) would be at 5 per
  cent ... $1,000.00<br>
  Proceeding to take yearly from now on 1 per cent additional of the gross ground
  rent of $68 for a period of thirty years would amount in all to 30 per cent
  of $68, equal to&nbsp;&nbsp; .... $20.40<br>
  Which, added to the tax already taken .... $18.00 <br>
  Would give at the end of thirty years, from the $1,000 worth of land alone,
  everything else being exempted, a total tax of .... $38.40.<br>
  Which is not much more than one half of the gross ground rent of ... $68.00<br>
    <br>
  The opening exhibit in detail would stand as follows:<br>
  In 1915 the tax on this $1,000 worth of land was $18.00<br>
  In 1916 the tax would be $18 plus 68 cents (1 per cent of the gross ground
  rent, $68); equal to .... $18.68<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $49.32<br>
  In 1917 the tax would be $18 plus $1.36 (2 per cent of the $68), totaling ....
  $19.36<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $48.64,<br>
  In 1918 the tax would be $18 plus $2.04 (3 per cent of the $68) or $20.45<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $47.96<br>
  In 1945 the tax on the land would be $18 plus $20.40 (30 per cent of the $68)
  or&nbsp; ... $38.40<br>
  With all improvements exempted.<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $29.60.<br>
