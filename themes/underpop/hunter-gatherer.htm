Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p><strong>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</strong></p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by
                agreement divide the earth between them. Under this compact each
                might
                claim exclusive right to his share as against the other. But
            neither could
                  rightfully
                    continue such claim against the next man born. For since
            no one comes into the world
                      without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his
                      equal right to the use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them
                      to refuse him any use of the earth which they had divided
                      between them would
                      therefore be for
                      them to commit
                      murder.
                      And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless
                      by laboring for them or by giving them part of the products
                      of
                      his labor
                      he bought it
                      of them,
                      would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
        of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
        it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
        sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
        and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right
    to do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
        thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the
    fairest division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
        of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
        octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
        duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
        on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
        the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
        be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
        need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
        deem a right one?</p>
      <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
        the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
        scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
        price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
        they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
        thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
        others.</p>
      <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
      <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
        are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
        that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
        the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
        effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
        buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
        gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
        of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
        sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
        it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
        of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
        instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
        of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
      <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
        show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
        intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
      <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
        a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
        the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
        of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
        in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
        of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
        reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
        always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
        user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
        pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
        the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
        or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
        to be a user.</p>
      <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
        of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
        what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
        to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
        community as a whole.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
            are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
            what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
            from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
            for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
            be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
            in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
            will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
            as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
            determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
            the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
            increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
            cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
            or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
            in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
            recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
            cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
          Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
              by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
              and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
              can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
          2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
          particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
          by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
          for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
          3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
          in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
          social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
          withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
            be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
            the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
            land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
            because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
            economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
            were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
            since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
            of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
            receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
            demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
            to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
            were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
            for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
          merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
        of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
        to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
        impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
        it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
        by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
        artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
        that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
        most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
        enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
        temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
        innocent.</p>
      <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
        needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
        of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
        nourishment of the babe.</p>
      <p>See how close is the analogy. <strong>In that primitive condition ere the
          need for the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor
          have value,
        but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.</strong>    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
        necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
        begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
        more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
        time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
        The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
        since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
        steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
        centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
        Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
        of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
        due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
        cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
        streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
        health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
        of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
        the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
        improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
        law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
        anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
        values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
      <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
        and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
        If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
        with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
        the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
        us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
        that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
      <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one
        thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
        of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
        improvements
        of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and
        the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
        Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
        is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society,
        is it
        not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
        while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with
        the advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each
        member
        of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him
        from his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization
        lessen
        relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
        the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not
        show the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
        should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and
        greater
        equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making
        it, an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each
    member is capable of an independent life. He can build his own habitation,
    hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own clothing, manufacture
    his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments. He has all the knowledge of
    nature possessed by his tribe &#8212; knows what vegetable productions are
    fit for food, and where they maybe found; knows the habits and resorts of
    beasts, birds, fishes and insects; can pilot himself by the sun or the stars,
    by the turning of blossoms or the mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable
    of supplying all his wants. He may be cut off from his fellows and still
    live; and thus possesses an independent power which makes him a free contracting
    party in his relations to the community of which he is a member.</p>
  <p>Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized society,
    whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but the infinitesimal
    part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of things that constitute the
    wealth of society and go to supply even the most primitive wants; who not
    only cannot make even the tools required for his work, but often works with
    tools that he does not own, and can never hope to own. Compelled to even
    closer and more continuous labor than the savage, and gaining by it no more
    than the savage gets &#8212; the mere necessaries of life &#8212; he loses
    the independence of the savage. He is not only unable to apply his own powers
    to the direct satisfaction of his own wants, but, without the concurrence
    of many others, he is unable to apply them indirectly to the satisfaction
    of his wants. He is a mere link in an enormous chain of producers and consumers,
    helpless to separate himself, and helpless to move, except as they move.
    The worse his position in society, the more dependent is he on society; the
    more utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself. The very power
    of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes from his own
    control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions of others, or by
    general causes over which he has no more influence than he has over the motions
    of the solar system. The primeval curse comes to be looked upon as a boon,
    and men think, and talk, and clamor, and legislate as though monotonous manual
    labor in itself were a good and not an evil, an end and not a means. Under
    such circumstances, the man loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the
    godlike power of modifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave,
    a machine, a commodity &#8212; a thing, in some respects, lower than the
    animal.</p>
  <p>I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas of
    the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or Cooper.
    I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low and narrow
    range. I believe that civilization is not only the natural destiny of man,
    but the enfranchisement, elevation, and refinement of all his powers, and
    think that it is only in such moods as may lead him to envy the cud-chewing
    cattle, that a man who is free to the advantages of civilization could look
    with regret upon the savage state. But, nevertheless, I think no one who
    will open his eyes to the facts, can resist the conclusion that there are
    in the heart of our civilization large classes with whom the veriest savage
    could not afford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if, standing
    on the threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering life as
    a Terra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in the Arctic
    Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized country as
    Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in selecting the
    lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of wealth are condemned
    to want, suffer all the privations of the savage, without his sense of personal
    freedom; they are condemned to more than his narrowness and littleness, without
    opportunity for the growth of his rude virtues; if their horizon is wider,
    it is but to reveal blessings that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    V, Chapter 2: The Problem Solved: The Persistence of Poverty Amid Advancing
    Wealth</p>
  <p> LET us try to trace the genesis of civilization. Gifted alone with the
    power of relating cause and effect, man is among all animals the only producer
    in the true sense of the term. . . . But the same quality of reason which
    makes him the producer, also, wherever exchange becomes possible, makes him
    the exchanger. And it is along this line of exchanging that the body economic
    is evolved and develops, and that all the advances of civilization are primarily
    made. . . . With the beginning of exchange or trade among men this body economic
    begins to form, and in its beginning civilization begins. . . . To find an
    utterly uncivilized people, we must find a people among whom there is no
    exchange or trade. Such a people does not exist, and, as far as our knowledge
    goes, never did. To find a fully civilized people, we must find a people
    among whom exchange or trade is absolutely free, and has reached the fullest
    development to which human desires can carry it. There is, as yet, unfortunately,
    no such people. &#8212; The Science of Political Economy &#8212; unabridged:

  <p><br>
    WHEN we, come to analyze production, we find it to fall into three modes,
      viz::<br>
    ADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so as to
    fit them for the satisfaction of human desire.<br>
    GROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising vegetables
    or animals.<br>
    EXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth, the
    higher powers of those natural forces which vary with locality, or of those
    human forces which vary with situation, occupation, or character. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    III, Chapter 3, The Laws of Distribution: of Interest and the Cause of Interest</p>
  <p>THESE modes seem to appear and to assume importance, in the development
    of human society, much in the order here given. They originate from the increase
    of the desires of men with the increase of the means of satisfying them,
    under pressure of the fundamental law of political economy, that men seek
    to satisfy their desires with the least exertion. In the primitive stage
    of human life the readiest way of satisfying desires is by adapting to human
    use what is found in existence. In a later and more settled stage it is discovered
    that certain desires can be more easily and more fully satisfied by utilizing
    the principle of growth and reproduction, as by cultivating vegetables and
    breeding animals. And in a still later period of development, it becomes
    obvious that certain desires can be better and more easily satisfied by exchange,
    which brings out the principle of co-operation more fully and powerfully
    than could obtain among unexchanging economic units. &#8212; The Science
