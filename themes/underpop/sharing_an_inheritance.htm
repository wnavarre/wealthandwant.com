  <p>Why on earth do our laws and traditions permit some of us to privatize that
      which rightly belongs to ALL of us? There is enough to go around, but it
    <em>isn't</em> going around. It is getting stuck in the pockets of those
    who have claimed the economic value of our best land as their own treasure,
    and declared that others must pay the taxes which support our common spending
    (and thereby make the best land even more valuable!!)</p>

  Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
  Labor &#8212; An
  Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p><strong>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</strong></p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
        paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
        paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
        paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
        mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
        by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
        and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
        from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
        value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
        owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land</strong>. (8.)</p>
  <p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
    to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
    of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
    you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others. You
    say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the earth
    does not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess
    the soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the
    land.</p>
  <p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
    of conscience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
        our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular,
        leaving the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I
        being the eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing
        so I have not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let
        them work for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would
        have had to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not
        be clear?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal
    sin, and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to
    make restitution and to do penance?</p>
  <p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
    land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
    supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a
    number of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly
    and prosper, you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership
    in the river, refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought
    it of them; and that thus they had become rich without work, while the others,
    though working hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly
    able to exist?</p>
  <p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
  <p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
    action:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby
        to minister to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does
        not
      drink of
        the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the river
      contribute their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all
      water is supplied
        either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry which
        is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for the
        water.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
    yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
  <p><strong>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly
      depriving a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless
    he will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves
    his victim to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. </strong>But I would like
    to point out how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among
    private owners, ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks
    the largest facts.</p>
  <p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
    where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
    are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
    was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
    centuries has condemned it to desertion? History tells us. It was private
    property in land; the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw that
    ancient Italy was perishing; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop
    of men, let in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of
    Odin and Thor, and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the
    East shivered the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars
    of Mohammedan hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church
    of St. Sophia trampled the cross to rear the crescent!</p>
  <p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
    tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
    sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
    are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
    you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
    they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>

  <p>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
    and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the
    growth of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the
    artificial scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem
    as if there is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</p>
  <p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
    private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
    the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
    the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you may
    see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet,
    that prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the
    midst of the earth.</p>

MAN is driven by his instincts and needs to form society. Society, thus formed,
has certain needs and functions for which revenue is required. These needs and
functions increase with social development, requiring a larger and larger revenue.
Now, experience and analogy, if not the instinctive perceptions of the human
mind, teach us that there is a natural way of satisfying every natural want.
And if human society is included in nature, as it surely is, this must apply
to social wants as well as to the wants of the individual, and there must be
a natural or right method of taxation, as there is a natural or right method
of walking. &#8212;<em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

that it is not wrong for you to own the spring, then how shall your fellows slake

        illth &#8212; is the dark side of capitalism. This dark side needs to
        be addressed.</p>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>4. FIX THE CODE, NOT THE SYMPTOMS &#8212; </strong></font>If we want to reduce illth on an economy-wide scale, we need to change the
        code that produces it. Ameliorating symptoms after the fact is a losing strategy.
        Unless the code itself is changed, our economic machine will always create
        more illth than it cleans up. Moreover, illth prevention is a lot cheaper
        than illth cleanup.</p>
    <p><strong><font size="-1">5. REVISE WISELY</font></strong> &#8212; Most of what&#8217;s in our current code is fine as is, and shouldn&#8217;t
        be tinkered with. &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it,&#8221; is
        a valid maxim. What does need fixing should be fixed gradually whenever
        possible, as fairly as possible, and at the lowest cost possible. Efficiency
        and grace
        matter.</p>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>6. MONEY ISN&#8217;T EVERYTHING &#8212; </strong></font>Money
        is the blood of our economic system; it shouldn&#8217;t be the soul.
        Humans have needs and desires that can&#8217;t be met by exchanging dollars.
        These needs include connection to family and community, closeness to nature,
        and meaning in life. A twenty-first-century economic system must address
        these needs, too. This doesn&#8217;t mean it must fill them directly; often,
        the best it can do is leave space for them to be filled in nonmonetary ways.
        What it shouldn&#8217;t do is get in the way of their being met.</p>
    <p><strong><font size="-1">7. GET THE INCENTIVES RIGHT &#8212; </font></strong>Notwithstanding
        the above, an economic system works best when it rewards desired behavior.
        As Mary Poppins put it, &#8220;A spoonful of sugar helps
        the medicine go down&#8221; (and as I&#8217;ve never forgotten, offering
        a free pint of Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s was the best way Working Assets ever
        found to get customers). While we&#8217;re looking for methods to protect
        nature and future generations, we need to make the incentives work for
        living humans as well.</p>

  <p>If you disagree with any of these premises, you&#8217;re unlikely to fancy
    my conclusions. If, on the other hand, these premises make sense to you,
    then welcome to these pages. I won&#8217;t bore you with statistics, or tell
    you, yet again, that our planet is going to hell; I&#8217;m tired, as I suspect
    you are, of numbers and gloom. Nor will I tell you we can save the planet
    by doing ten easy things; you know it&#8217;s not that simple. What I will
    tell you is how we can retool our economic system, one step at a time, so
    that after a decent interval, it respects nature and the human psyche, and
    still provides abundantly for our material needs.</p>
  <p>Perhaps capitalism will always involve a Faustian deal of some sort:
                        if we want the goods, we must accept the bads. But if
    we must make a deal
                          with the devil, I believe we can make a much better
    one than we presently have.
                            We&#8217;ll have to be shrewd, tough, and bold.</p>
  <p>But I&#8217;m confident that, if we understand how to get a better deal,
    we will get one. After all, our children and lots of other creatures are
    counting on us. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like statism conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, privatism connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system. ...</p>
  <p>Propertize, But Don&#8217;t Privatize</p>
  <p>Simply turning the commons over to corporations, without compensation or
    further ado, is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. There&#8217;s
    no guarantee the corporations will preserve the asset, much less share its
    benefits widely. We&#8217;re asked to believe that corporate owners will
    do the right things, either because it&#8217;s in their self-interest or
    because they&#8217;re socially responsible, but historical evidence and the
    inner logic of corporations suggest otherwise.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s possible to propertize a natural inheritance without
    privatizing it, and in the next chapter I&#8217;ll show how this can work.
    The basic idea is to turn pieces of the commons into common property rather
    than corporate property. This would let us charge corporations higher (and
    truer) prices for using the commons, while sharing the benefits of those
    higher prices broadly. And it would ensure that the quantity of usage rights
    sold &#8212; which is to say, the level of pollution allowed &#8212; is set
    with the interests of future generations foremost in mind. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust and liquidity, I eventually realized, are just two small rivulets
    in an enormous river of common wealth that encompasses nature, community,
    and culture. Nature&#8217;s gifts are all those wondrous things, living and
    nonliving, that we inherit from the creation. Community includes the myriad
    threads, tangible and intangible, that connect us to other humans efficiently.
    Culture embodies our vast store of science, inventions, and art.</p>
  <p>Despite its invisibility, the value of our common wealth is immense. How
    much, roughly, is it worth? It&#8217;s easy to put a dollar value on private
    assets; they&#8217;re traded regularly, so their exchange value &#8212; if
    not their intrinsic value &#8212; is readily knowable. This isn&#8217;t the
    case with common wealth. Many shared inheritances are valuable beyond measure.
    Others are potentially quantifiable, but there&#8217;s no current market
    for them.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, economists are a clever lot, and they&#8217;ve developed methodologies
    to estimate the value of things that aren&#8217;t traded. Using such methodologies,
    it&#8217;s possible to get an order of magnitude for the value of common
    wealth. The conclusion that emerges from numerous studies is that even though
    much common wealth can&#8217;t be valued monetarily, the parts that can be
    valued are worth more than all private assets combined (see figure 5.1).
