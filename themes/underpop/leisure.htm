<blockquote>
  <p align="left">When a significant portion of our society lives without leisure
    to enjoy their lives, must spend significantly more than 40 hours a week
    to simply provide the most basis needs of their families, something is wrong.
    How do we correct this? Where is the key to creating a society in which parents
    can provide for themselves and their children without spending the majority
    of their waking hours earning a living? </p>
  <p align="left">Georgists see the connection between
      the privatization of the growing value of our best land and the lack of
    leisure and security for a large subset of our society. When landholders
    as landholders
      get rich without lifting a finger, that wealth does not come out of thin
      air; it comes at the expense of their fellow human beings. But this is
    not a difficult problem to solve, and solving it will relieve a number of
    other
      problems: urban sprawl, excessive fuel usage, housing affordability, excessive
      taxes on productive activity, and many others.</p>

        11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
        IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
        and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
    burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
  consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
    in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
    inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
    as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
    a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
    capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
    and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
    this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
    the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
    instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
    capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
    state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
    would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
    two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
    and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
    And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
    effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
    the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
    community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
    as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
    equality. ...</p>
  <p>But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that while
      thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor, the equalization
      in the distribution of wealth that would result from the simple plan of
    taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity with which wealth is pursued.
    It
      seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
      no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would take the
      trouble to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the
      spectacle
      of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for the
      sake of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state
      of society
      where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration
      with which the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches,
      whoever would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked
      upon as we
    would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen hats.</p>
  <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare it?
    Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development, it is
    not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come from the
    weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and what, if a
    remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
  <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
    of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production is
    greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of the most
    obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire to get rich
    at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping together riches
    would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

  <p>To remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure, and

          suffer, though they know it not, from the want, ignorance, and degradation
          that are underneath.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs
    of civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. <strong>We see that the law of justice,
    the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed
    the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. </strong>We see that Christ was not a mere
    dreamer when he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its
    right-doing
    they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now the public is paying for private parties.
        That is not fair.</span> Look at the economy. Take taxes off homes, and
        they become more affordable. Have some kind of land charge, and housing
        stock
        increases as sites get developed. Affordable housing helps stabilize
        neighborhoods. In places that do have the land tax, i.e., Australia and
        New Zealand, they
        have fewer disputes with assessment. Assessors say their job is so much
        easier now. If land is less profitable and less of a political football,
        it is less
        tense in local politics.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you take taxes off labor and capital,
            more investment flows into jobs, and we would have close to full employment,
            so labor could demand full market value for services. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We could double the income of the average
            worker with no loss in standard of living.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>If fewer demands are placed on government by citizens, it doesn't have
          to borrow so much. </li>
    <li>If you reduce the amount of tax on the economy, and reduce the amount
      of redeemable notes, then we should be able to eliminate inflation. It
      is unmasked.
          You can see lower prices; the cost of living goes down. It will change
      social relationships. </li>
    <li>Labor and capital make up, with higher wages for labor, lower taxes for
          capital, and more investment funds. </li>
    <li>Labor can negotiate from a position of strength. </li>
    <li>Capital might want to share management decisions and spread that risk
      of liability to workers. It tends to reduce hierarchy and increase equality
          in society.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  What other social relations might change? Increase land ownership participation
    in community and it benefits community, with town hall meetings and block parties.
    Those kinds of communities have less crime. Pittsburgh has six times greater
    land tax than improvements, more affordable housing, and less
    crime.<br>
    <br>
    The main indicator of economic health is called the GDP. A good measure would
    be <span style="font-weight: bold;">leisure</span>, the amount of time off
    from labor to maintain a comfortable standard of living. If we shift, it
    would shrink
    the work week, and help get rid of rush

3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why isn&#8217;t economic growth making us happier?</strong> There
  are many possibilities, and they&#8217;re additive rather than exclusive.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> One is that, once material needs are met, happiness is based
        on comparative rather than absolute conditions. </strong>If your neighbors
        have bigger houses than you do, the fact that yours is smaller diminishes
        your happiness, even though your house by itself meets your needs. In
        the same way, more income wouldn&#8217;t make you happier if other people
        got even more. That&#8217;s why an affluent country can get richer without
        its citizens getting happier.</li>
    <li> <strong>A second reason is that surplus capitalism foments anxiety. </strong>Millions
      live one paycheck, or one illness, away from disaster. When disaster strikes,
      the safety nets beneath them are thin. And everyone sees jobs vanishing
      as capital scours the planet for cheap labor.</li>
    <li><strong> Another reason is that surplus capitalism speeds up life and
        creates great stress.</strong> Humans didn&#8217;t evolve to multitask,
        sit in traffic jams, or work, shop, and pay bills 24/7. We need rest,
        relaxation, and time for companionship and creativity. Surplus capitalism
        can&#8217;t give us enough of those things.</li>
    <li><strong> Similarly, its nonstop marketing message &#8212; you&#8217;re
        no good without Brand X &#8212; breeds the opposites of gratitude and
        contentment, two widely acknowledged precursors of happiness.</strong> According
        to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the average American encounters
        about three thousand such messages each day. No wonder we experience
        envy, greed, and dissatisfaction. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
