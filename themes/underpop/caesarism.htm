<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus said &quot;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.&quot; And perhaps he was
      making a comment about what rightly belonged to Caesar. Caesar was not
    part of the community to which Jesus was speaking. What, if anything, was
    rightly
      Caesar's? Was he somehow entitled to a portion of the fruits of the labor
    provided by the community? By what right? </p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
      of Labor &#8212; An
  Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from
      nature, not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that
      to take the
      value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
      owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
  <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
    indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
    want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
    of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
    you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
    of land.</p>
  <p><strong>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from
      nature, not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership
      with possession
    and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
    property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any
    other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
    in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
    to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that
    it came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
    man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively
    to him or to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property,
    which originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
    of the thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
    so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice
    to the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
    They do not belong to <em>Caesar</em>. They are things that God, of whom nature is
    but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
    labor.</strong></p>
  <p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any grant from
    the Maker of land? What does nature give to such ownership? how does she
    in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
    of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
    their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and
    another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from
    man and passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression
    of his labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the
    individual; but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed
    before man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men
    come and go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man
    for &#8220;the daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?</p>
  <p>Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from nature.
    Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of morals when it
    is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as it
    is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice
    on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
    of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
  <p>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value of landownership
    for the use of the community, the real injustice is in leaving it in private
    hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</p>
  <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
    for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
    God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited of
    their natural rights can be restored to them, the present owners of land
    shall first be compensated.</p>
  <p>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and largely
    benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists are
    much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though the great
    landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general among whom the
    profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges,
    etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers in
    the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly, more strongly,
    more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or losses would your
    duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you to listen for one moment
    to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
  <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that those
    whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners would
    be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
    alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim
    to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the
    same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest
    of what they before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice
    are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that land is
    really the storehouse that God owes to all his children, you will no more
    listen to any demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses
    would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before
    letting the children of Israel go.</p>
  <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
    of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
    We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
    We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to
    bury their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of
    land values have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus
    got. We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that
    for the future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community
    the rent that to the community is justly due. ...  <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and. urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. <a href="../../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... let us lay down and briefly defend the proposition that &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Taxation as a means of meeting the proper expenses of government is oppressive,
      unjust, inexpedient and unnecessary.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This proposition will strike a good many readers as absurd, but all must at
    least recognize the timeliness of the topic and the importance of any contribution
    to the discussion of a subject which is agitating the whole civilized world,
    for the methods, subjects and amounts of taxation are among the pressing problems
    of every country.</p>
  <p>The most obvious question which arises in the mind of anyone who reads for
    the first time the proposition above laid down is this:</p>
  <p>&quot;If taxation is unnecessary, what is to take its place? Government and
    its functions are increasingly expensive. They require a lot of money. Where
    is it to come from?&quot; The answer may be placed in the form of a second
    proposition:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village, city,
          state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing income,
          growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
          governmental
          expenditure.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
    on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
    of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
    state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
    its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
    (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
    all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
    society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
    descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot; ...</p>
  <p>But
    make it plain to the wayfaring man that taxation can be abolished and will
    be abolished whenever the voters of any political unit so decree, and
    a force of hope and purpose will be liberated which must bring nearer the
    time when the things that are the community's will be rendered to it, and
    the things
    which are the individual's will be left in his unmolested possession. The
    watchword of our friends the Georgeites is &quot;A Single Tax.&quot; The true slogan
    is &quot;Not a Single Tax!&quot;; and the triumph of the cause behind that
    slogan would cut more of the taproots of poverty, vice and social unrest
    than any other progressive step which is a legislative possibility. <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read
