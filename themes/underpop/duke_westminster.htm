<blockquote>
  <p>MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would be hard to
find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while the
general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the capitalist. So
true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to put
all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely reduce all great
fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest landowner
in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation would largely reduce his
enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income from
them, and doubtless much personal property in various other shapes. He would
still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">Who Owns Southern
        California</a> (1997)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Non-resident aliens own about 75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A. CBD
      west of Broadway [L.A. Times 21 Sept 86].<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Grosvenor</span>, an Englishman, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a.k.a.
      The Duke of Westminster</span>, is one of these is. Grosvenor owns half
      the Wells Fargo Building on a valuable site in downtown L.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;Grosvenor
      also holds 17 acres in Silicon Valley. He also holds Annacis Island, 1200
      acres near Vancouver, B.C. He is a major owner in downtown Melbourne. He
      is diversified
      around the world. These are parts of his overseas holdings. Their value
      was estimated in 1985 at $1.3 billion, but they were not for sale and the
      basis
      for the valuation is not given. Like city land worldwide, they must have
      doubled in price, 1985-89 &#8212; and then dropped again.<br>
      <br>
    The core of Grosvenor's holdings is 300 acres in central London, including half
    the Mayfair District, most of Belgravia, and Grosvenor Square where the U.S.
    Embassy is one of his many lessees. His country estate is 4500 acres. Grosvenor,
    along with Earl Cadogan, the Duke of Bedford, Viscount Portman, and Lord Howard
    de Walden, pretty well control London land. [L.A. Times, 9/85]</p>

<p>Dave Wetzel: <strong><a href="../../docs/Wetzel_Westminster.htm">Who Should Get the Land Rent?</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Transport for London does not own all of the coach station. One third of
    the land and the old in-bound coach shed is owned by &quot;Grosvenor Estates.&quot;</p>
  <p>We pay them &pound;230,000 per annum for the use of their land.</p>
  <p>But where do we get the money from?</p>
  <p>We charge the coach companies a fee for every coach that comes into the coach
      station and a part of that goes to our landlord.</p>
  <p>Where do they get the money from?</p>
  <p>They get the money from their ticket prices.</p>
  <p>So every poor traveller is contributing towards the &pound;230,000 given to
      Grosvenor Estates, which is owned by the Duke of Westminster. (His family name
      was &quot;Grosvenor&quot; until Queen Victoria elevated one &quot;Hugh Grosvenor&quot; to
      the peerage in 1874.) They have owned most of Mayfair, Belgravia and parts
      of Victoria for hundreds of years. </p>
  <p>So, we have the absurdity, . . . . . . . . nay the obscenity!, of the poorest
      travellers in the country, subsidising the third richest man in the country,
      to the tune of &pound;230,000 per annum! </p>
  <p>Surely, the value of this land only arises because people live and work in
      our great city?</p>
  <p>So surely it is all the people that should benefit from land wealth?</p>
  <p>We SHOULD pay rent for the land.</p>
  <p>All of the land. </p>
  <p> But <em>not</em> to the rich Duke, but to the Government, so that they can
      use this natural wealth to pay for schools and hospitals etc.</p>
  <p>And not from this one site, but from all the land in the country.</p>
  <p> AND if there is any wealth left over &#8212; and I'm sure there would be &#8212; the
      Government could return it to all of us in the form of a land dividend.

<p>Karl Williams: <a href="../../docs/Williams_Landlording.html">Landlording It Over Us</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>      Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his underlings
        collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
    land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated his
    net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give him
    his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald
    Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
    Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland
    which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
    the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and Belgravia, are
    today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span><br>
    <br>
    It was a handy marriage which brought this fortune into the Grosvenor
    family&#8217;s hands &#8211; in 1677, Sir Richard Grosvenor married Mary Davies,
    heir to the hundred acres north of Piccadilly and the &#8220;Five Fields&#8221; south
    of Knightsbridge. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Mayfair and Belgravia were
    built up as residential areas for London&#8217;s wealthy classes, a position
    they have occupied ever since. Unlike many other great landowners who have
    cashed in, the Grosvenors held on and have benefited enormously from the
    latest boom
    in London property prices.<br>
    <br>
    The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His commercial property
    company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast array of investments
    and developments around the world. These include
    office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>, business
    parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>, luxury apartments
    in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
    shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>.
    In the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in Basingstoke
    and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use redevelopment in the centre
    of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair, land values are in the stratosphere:
    in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold <span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres
    of Mayfair for a cool &pound;335m.</span><br>
    <br>
    Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land value taxation,
    the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
    But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never contemplate
    selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason for not selling.
    (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&#8220;This is part of my heritage,
    my birthright. It is not to do with anything materialistic,
    but is deeply ingrained.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/irish_land_question.html">The Land Question</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Think of these enormous wastes, and of the others which, like these, are due
      to the fundamental wrong which produces an unjust distribution of wealth and
      distorts the natural development of society, and you will begin to see what
      a higher, purer, richer civilization would be made possible by the simple measure
      that will assert natural rights. You will begin to see how, even if no one
      but the present landholders were to be considered, this would be the greatest
      boon that could be vouchsafed them by society, and that, for them to fight
      it, would be as if the dog with a tin kettle tied to his tail should snap at
      the hand that offered to free him. Even the greatest landholder! As for such
      landholders as our working farmers and homestead-owners, the slightest discussion
      would show them that they had everything to gain by the change. But even such
      landholders
    as the Duke of Westminster and the Astors would be gainers.</p>
