<p align="center"><strong>Land Reform</strong></p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: I want to follow-up on what you had said some months ago about land reform:</p>
  <p>JES: &quot;The main, underlying idea of Henry George is the taxation of
    land <em>and other natural resources</em>. At the time, people thought, &quot;<em>not
    really that too</em>,&quot; but what was underlying his ideas is rent associated
    with things that are inelastically supplied, which are land <em>and natural
    resources</em>.
    And using natural resource extraction and using land rents as the basis of
    taxation is an argument that I think makes an awful lot of sense because
    it is a non-distortionary source of income and wealth.</p>
  <p>Q: In <em>Globalization and its Discontents</em>, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in <em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em>]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ...</p>
  <p>Q: Has President Mugabe of Zimbabwe's misuse of government power to return
    land to its so-called &quot;rightful owners&quot; given land reform a bad
    name?</p>
  <p>JES: That's true, but it doesn't have to be done that way. Now, one of the
    things that is again in the spirit of Henry George is that, if you have land
    taxes, then the market value of land goes down. What you're willing to pay
    for land is the difference between what you pay and what you get to keep
    after paying your land taxes. So, in a Henry George world, the amount of
    compensation would be very low. So one could argue that moving toward a land
    tax would facilitate that reform. Once we raise rates on land taxes, the
    market value will have to go down. The government can buy the land and redistribute
    it to the workers, and they then would be able to keep the fruits of their
    labor. They will continue to pay the land tax, but the product of their own
    efforts &#8212; their labor &#8212; will be their own, as opposed to sharing
    fifty percent with the landlord.</p>
  <p>Q: Do you think land reform could possibly find a way onto the political
    agenda in the United States?</p>
  <p>JES: No. Land reform is not a big issue in the United States because we
    don't have a lot of sharecropping. There's some, but it's very limited.</p>
  <p>Q: What countries do you regard as the most politically open to tax reform
    as a means of achieving meaningful land reform?</p>
  <p>JES: I think some countries in South America are moving in that direction.
    They're beginning to do this form of taxation because they want the land
    to be utilized. Some people own land but make no use of it.</p>
  <p>Q: You mentioned the World Bank's program titled &quot;Market-Based Land
    Reform.&quot; Is that the only international forum in which there is a chance
    of gaining politically-effective support for &quot;land value taxation&quot; as
    an instrument for land reform?</p>
  <p>JES: There's not a lot [of] discussion going on in those circles about land
    reform. The World Bank is still talking about it, as in the program I was
    talking about. And certain countries are continuing to talk about it within
    themselves. But the IMF is not, and I don't know of any NGO (nongovernmental
    organization) that is. ...</p>
  <p>Q: In your opinion, would it be more effective to attempt to achieve support
    from economists about the need for such reform, or to bypass them in seeking
    to build popular support independently from them, in that the views of mainstream
    economists on the topic of land reform might fairly be characterized as an &quot;intransigent&quot;?</p>
  <p>JES: There are some economists who are interested in this. I think most
    economists would like the idea, and would support it. But, economists spend
    their time on things that they think have marketability. So it isn't that
    they don't think it's a good idea; they don't think there's any resonance
    in it. President Bush is still talking about the inheritance tax, and income
    tax, and they want to get involved in what other people are talking about.
    It's a social phenomenon, I think. So, if you get a lot of other people talking
    about it, then they'll join the fray.</p>
  <p>Q: You are aware that Henry George was a critic of the moral foundations
    of our economic institutions. What do you think of reform efforts toward
    land value taxation based on an appeal to morality?</p>
  <p>JES: What it fits into is that there is a wide view today that we should
    tax environmental &quot;bads&quot; such as pollution and the like. And switch
    from taxing good things like labor. So, in a way, that's where it comes in:
    let's stop taxing good things like labor, and tax things that are resources.
    So the argument is, &quot;why tax things that are contributing to society?&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Stiglitz, from <em>Globalization and Its Discontents </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Stabilization is on the agenda; job creation is off. Taxation, and its adverse
      effects, are on the agenda; land reform is off. There is money to bail
    out banks but not to pay for improved education and health services, let
    alone
      to bail out workers who are thrown out of their jobs as a result of the
    IMF's macroeconomic mismanagement. ... </p>
  <p> The sharecropping system weakens incentives&#8212;where they share equally
      with the landowners, the effects are the same as a 50 percent tax on poor
    farmers. The IMF rails against high tax rates that are imposed against the
    rich, pointing
      out how they destroy incentives, but nary a word is spoken about these
    hidden taxes.... Land reform represents a fundamental change in the structure
    of society,
      one that those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those
    with whom the international finance institutions interact, do not necessarily
    like. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>from an interview with Greg Palast (online at <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/the-globalizer-who-came-in-from-the-cold">http://www.gregpalast.com/the-globalizer-who-came-in-from-the-cold</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So then I turned on Stiglitz. OK, Mr Smart-Guy Professor, how would you
    help developing nations? Stiglitz proposed radical land reform, an attack
    at the heart of &#8220;landlordism,&#8221; on the usurious rents charged
    by the propertied oligarchies worldwide, typically 50% of a tenant&#8217;s
    crops. So I had to ask the professor: as you were top economist at the World
    Bank, why didn&#8217;t the Bank follow your advice?</p>
  <p>&#8220;If you challenge [land ownership], that would be a change in the
    power of the elites. That&#8217;s not high on their agenda.&#8221; Apparently
    not. ...</p>
  <p>I took away from my talks with the professor that the solution to world
  poverty and crisis is simple: remove the bloodsuckers.</p>
