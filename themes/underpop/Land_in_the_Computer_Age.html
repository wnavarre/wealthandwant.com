<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some might make the argument that land
no longer matters in the 21st
century, now that we have computers which allow some of us to
telecommute and we can purchase many of our goods from internet
retailers rather than brick and mortar stores.<br>
<br>
That argument, though, fails to recognize the myriad ways we rely on
land itself, and that land includes not only
sites in the sense of plots of land, but also the entire natural
creation -- water, air, the electromagnetic spectrum, oil, coal, gas,
gold, etc.-- and many other things that are in limited supply such as
landing rights at LaGuardia airport, ... on which we depend.&nbsp; <br>

Who would have imagined 20 years ago that today a huge business would
arise selling individual bottles of drinking water, and that  gallons
of spring water would sell for so much, and have so much shelf
space, in grocery stores?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next thing we know we'll be bottling the air and selling it (see <a

<blockquote>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
    That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
    to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
    of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as through
    an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position fortified,
    and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social
    and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by its very
    simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
    of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one for
    an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized world. <strong>And
    back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an active, energetic
    power, a power that in every country, be its political forms what they may,
    writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast and dominant pecuniary
    interest. ...</strong></p>
  <p>...For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the
      supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

Weld Carter: <a href="../../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George is largely remembered for
the single tax. But the single
tax came at the end of a long trail as a means -- <i>the</i> means,
he said -- by which to remedy ills previously identified and
diagnosed. Behind the single tax lay a closely knit system of
thought. To understand George, it is necessary to go behind the
single tax and explore that system for its major characteristics.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notable in George's work is the
emphasis he laid on the relation
of man to the earth. "The most important of all the material
relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George might well be called a land
economist, indeed, the foremost
land economist. For George, the basic fact of man's physical
existence is that he is a land animal, "who can live only on and from
land, and can use other elements, such as air, sunshine and water,
only by the use of land."&nbsp; "Without either of
the three elements, land, air and water, man could not exist; but he
is peculiarly a land animal, living on its surface, and drawing from
it his supplies."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So man not only lives off land,
levying on it for its materials
and forces, but he also lives on land. His very life depends on land.
". ..land is the habitation of man, the store-house upon which he
must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be
applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products of
the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the
forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again -
children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower
of the field. Take away from man all that belongs to land, and he is
but a disembodied spirit."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land and man, in that order! These
two things are the
fundamentals. They are, for instance, the fundamentals of production.
It is said that without labor, certainly, there can be no production.
Similarly, without land, clearly there can be no agricultural
production or mining production. It was just as clear to George that
there could be no production of any kind without land. There could be
no factory production, no trade, no services rendered, and none of
the multitudinous operations of town and city. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All these processes require land:
a place, a spot, a site, a
location, so many acres or square feet of the earth's surface on
which to be performed. "In every form ...the exertion of human labor
in the production of wealth requires space; not merely standing or
resting space, but moving space -- space for the movements of the
human body and its organs, space for the storage and changing in
place of materials and tools and products. This is as true of the
tailor, the carpenter, the machinist, the merchant or the clerk, as
of the farmer or stock-grower, or of the fisherman or miner."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The office building, the store,
the bank, as well as the factory,
need land just as do the farm and mine. Land is needed as sites on
which to build structures. Likewise, businesses need land as the
locations on which to perform their subsequent operations. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George adds: "But it may be said,
as I have often heard it said,
'We do not all want land! We cannot all become farmers!' To this I
reply that we do all want land, though it may be in different ways
and in varying degrees. Without land no human being can live; without
land no human occupation can be carried on. Agriculture is not the
only use of land. It is only one of many. And just as the uppermost
story of the tallest building rests upon land as truly as the lowest,
so is the operative as truly a user of land as is the farmer. As all
wealth is in the last analysis the resultant of land and labor, so is
all production in the last analysis the expenditure of labor upon
land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad needs land, not just
for its terminals and depots but
for its very roadbeds; whoever uses the railroad uses the land that
the railroad occupies, as well as the improvements the railroad
affords. The State needs land not only for parks and reservoirs but
for schools and courts, for hospitals and prisons, and for roads and
highways with which to link its residents together. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our homes require land, whether
the home is a country estate, a
city apartment, or a room in hotel or tenement. Our diversions
require land, whether for a ride in the country, a round on the golf
course, a seat at the theatre, or a chair in the library or before
the television set. "Physically we are air-breathing, light-requiring
land animals, who for our existence and all our production require
place on the dry surface of our globe. And the fundamental perception
of the concept land -- whether in the wider use of the word as that
term of political economy signifying all that external nature offers
to the use of man, or in the narrower sense which the word usually
bears in common speech, where it signifies the solid surface of the
earth -- is that of extension; that of affording standing-place or
room." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In George's view, man's dependence
on land is universal and
endless, "...for land is the indispensible prerequisite to life."&nbsp;
"What is inexplicable, if we lose sight of
man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we
recognize it."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here then is the main element,
the distinctive characteristic, of
George's work. In George's view, man's relation to the earth is his
primary material relation. All other influences, therefore, must be
appraised as to how they affect, or are affected by, this basic
relation. It is perhaps this to which Soule refers when he says, of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, "This book expounded a theory
developed with superb logic."... <a href="../../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
