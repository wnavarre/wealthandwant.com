<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of
    Land Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury
in the Cities</a></p>
<p>Dan Sullivan's comments:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Of course, what happened when lefties like Upton Sinclair sold out to the expedient
      of class envy, was that the privileged classes strategically caved on these
      other taxes, so that now we do tax the rich man's stocks and bonds (and also
      the poor man's retirement funds) and his inheritances (if he is not rich
      enough to hold them overseas) and his wife's jewels (which merely causes
      unemployment among jewelers). And since these various unprincipled measures
      have been disastrous, people are now suspicious of any tax that falls on
      the rich, including the one proper tax, for which Mr. Sinclair, had he not
  been impatient for cheap victories, would have held out.</p>
  <p>It is often asserted that Henry George paved the way for the Progressive
    Movement, which in turn paved the way for the Socialist Movement. This passage,
    to me,
    is the *essential* description of how our own &quot;allies&quot; derailed
    us.</p>
  <p>Thus I regard as critically important, the following passage from paragraph
    18 of Tom Paine's &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> &quot;While, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest myself in
      the hard case of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance
            by the introduction
            of the system of landed property, I equally defend the right of the
      possessor
            to the part which is his.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  We must oppose those who would make public property private, but we must equally
      oppose those who would make private property public. In my opinion, Georgism
      was undone, not by its enemies, but by its shallower allies who were more
      enamored of victory than of principle.</p>
  <p>The rest of the Upton Sinclair article is wonderful, but this passage is especially
    wonderful in its own perverse way, because it is a window into exactly where
    the movement went astray. ... <a href="../../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>
