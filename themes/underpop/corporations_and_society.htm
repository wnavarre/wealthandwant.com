3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> For much of this time I was president of Working Assets, a company that
    donates 1 percent of its gross sales to nonprofit groups working for a better
    world. These donations come off its top line, not its bottom line; the company
    makes them whether it&#8217;s profitable or not (and many years we were not).
    It occurred to me that 1 percent is an exceedingly small portion of sales
    for any business to return to the larger world, given that businesses take
    so much from the larger world without paying. How, for example, could we
    make any goods without nature&#8217;s many free gifts? And how could we sell
    them without society&#8217;s vast infrastructure of laws, roads, money, and
    so on? At the very least, I liked to think, we ought to pay a 1 percent royalty
    for the privilege of being a limited liability corporation. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>What&#8217;s more, many negative externalities aren&#8217;t even the result
    of meeting genuine human needs. The word thneed doesn&#8217;t appear in any
    economics text, but it&#8217;s symbolic of our modern predicament. The word
    was coined by Theodor Geisel &#8212; better known as Dr. Seuss &#8212; in
    his children&#8217;s fable <em>The Lorax</em>. A thneed is a thing we want but don&#8217;t
    really need. As many parents will recall, <em>The Lorax</em> pits a dynamic entrepreneur
    (the Once-ler) against a pesky Lorax who &#8220;speaks for the trees.&#8221; The
    Once-ler makes thneeds by cutting down truffula trees. When the Lorax protests,
    the Once-ler replies:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>I&#8217;m being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.<br>
      A Thneed&#8217;s a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Economists have no technical term for thneed; they assume that all &#8220;demand&#8221; in
    the economy is equivalent, as long as it&#8217;s backed with money. Yet surely
    it would be helpful to differentiate. One can imagine an axis running from
    needs to thneeds. On one end are such things as food, shelter, basic transportation,
    and health care. On the other end are Coca-Cola, iPods, and Hummers. (Significantly,
    needs are generic, while thneeds are typically branded.) Filling needs contributes
    more to human well-being than does selling thneeds, yet our economic system
    increasingly devotes scarce resources to thneeds.</p>
  <p>Why do we have so much illth and so many thneeds? Because our economic operating
    system is far out of balance. On one side, representing owners of capital,
    are powerful profit-maximizing corporations. On the other side, representing
    future generations, nonhuman species, and millions of humans with unmet needs,
    are &#8212; almost nothing. The system lacks institutions that preserve shared
    inheritances, charge corporations for degrading nature, or boost the &#8220;demanding&#8221; power
    of people whose basic needs are ignored. Hence the system generates ever
    more illth, waste, and ever-widening disparities between rich and poor. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Enclosure, in which property rights are literally taken or given away, is
    half the reason for the commons&#8217; decline; the other half is a form
    of trespass called <em><strong>externalizing</strong></em> &#8212; that is,
    shifting costs to the commons. Externalizing is as relentless as enclosure,
    yet much less noticed, since it requires no active aid from politicians.
    It occurs quietly and continuously as corporations add illth to the commons
    without permission or payment.</p>
  <p>The one-two punch of enclosure and externalizing is especially potent. With
    one hand, corporations take valuable stuff <em><strong>from</strong></em> the
    commons and privatize it. With the other hand, they dump bad stuff <em><strong>into</strong></em> the
    commons and pay nothing. The result is profits for corporations but a steady
    loss of value for the commons. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The corporation is an externalizing machine, in the same way that a
      shark is a killing machine. There isn't any question of malevolence or
      of will. The enterprise has within it, as the shark has within it, those
      characteristics
    that enable it to do that for which it is designed.</em>    &#8212;
    Robert Monks, 1998 ...</p>
  <p>Propertize, But Don&#8217;t Privatize</p>
  <p>Simply turning the commons over to corporations, without compensation or
    further ado, is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. There&#8217;s
    no guarantee the corporations will preserve the asset, much less share its
    benefits widely. We&#8217;re asked to believe that corporate owners will
    do the right things, either because it&#8217;s in their self-interest or
    because they&#8217;re socially responsible, but historical evidence and the
    inner logic of corporations suggest otherwise.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s possible to propertize a natural inheritance without
    privatizing it, and in the next chapter I&#8217;ll show how this can work.
    The basic idea is to turn pieces of the commons into common property rather
    than corporate property. This would let us charge corporations higher (and
    truer) prices for using the commons, while sharing the benefits of those
    higher prices broadly. And it would ensure that the quantity of usage rights
    sold &#8212; which is to say, the level of pollution allowed &#8212; is set
    with the interests of future generations foremost in mind.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like <em>statism</em> conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, <em>privatism</em> connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system.</p>
  <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
    is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take data
    from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and display
    the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
  <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
    a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior of
    the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
    system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The algorithms
    are:<br>
    (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
    (2) distribute property income on a per-share basis, and<br>
    (3) the price of nature equals zero.<br>
    <strong>The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more property
    shares than the remaining 95 percent.</strong></p>
  <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell as
    much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources, and waste
    disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses the minds
    of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake up thinking about
    how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their product, they must
    create some. If they work in finance, they worry about margins and leverage.
    If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain hard, replace long-term
    employees with temps, and shift jobs to places where wages are lower. All
    the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to Wall Street.</p>
  <p>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s the
    combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism to devour
    nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time, nothing in the
    algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either individually or collectively,
    to preserve anything.</p>
  <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think about
    protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving something
    back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for actually doing
    such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does it mean that, from
    time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly flout the corporate
    algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying is that, in the great
    majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and its brethren are obeyed. <strong>For
    all practical purposes, the publicly traded corporation is a slave to its
    algorithm. </strong>... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>To build Capitalism 3.0, we each have unique roles to play. I therefore
    address the final pages of this book to a variety of people whose participation
    is critical. ...<br>
    POLITICIANS</p>
  <p>Everyone wants your attention. Channel 5 is on line 3 and a powerful lobbyist
    is at your door. It&#8217;s hard for you to see the forest for the trees.
    What can I possibly tell you?</p>
  <p>What I want to tell you is, there&#8217;s a fork in the road. On one side
    lies capitalism as we know it; on the other, an upgrade. You must decide
    which branch to take. Your choice has vast ramifications. Very possibly,
    the fate of the planet is in your hands. Trillions of dollars are also at
    stake. I want you to be courageous. I want you to choose the upgrade.</p>
  <p>But that isn&#8217;t what one says to a politician. What one says is, we
    need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs in America, and
    protect the environment. All those things cost money, and government doesn&#8217;t
    have enough. But here&#8217;s what government can do.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> First, delegate to an independent authority &#8212; something like the
        Fed &#8212; the power to cap U.S. carbon consumption. That way, when energy
        prices go up (which they inevitably will), you won&#8217;t get blamed.
        Also, make sure the carbon authority pays dividends, like the Alaska
        Permanent
        Fund. Then, when checks are mailed to your constituents, you can take
        credit.</li>
  <li> Second, talk about jobs and energy independence in your speeches. And
          push for an American Permanent Fund financed by sales of pollution
        permits. Within
        a few years, thousands of people in your district will be installing
        new energy systems and cashing dividend checks. You&#8217;ll be a hero.</li>
  <li> Finally, tell your donors not to worry. You&#8217;re a low-tax, small-government,
          pay-as-we-go kind of person. You think the environment should be protected
          through market mechanisms. You favor an ownership society in which every
          American has a tax-deferred savings account and no child is left behind.
