  <p><strong>Carbon Taxes
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
  <div align="left">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Let&#8217;s set aside for a moment the question of whether government
        is inherently biased toward property and focus instead on a purely mechanical
        question: is taxation a good tool for preserving gifts of nature? I pose
        this question because economists have advocated &#8220;green taxes&#8221; for
        over eighty years, and it&#8217;s time to move beyond this hoary panacea.</p>
      <p>The idea of using taxes to protect nature dates back to 1920, when Cambridge
        University&#8217;s top economist, <strong>Arthur Pigou</strong>, proposed
        it. At first blush the idea makes sense. If pollution is free, there&#8217;ll
        be lots of it. If it&#8217;s taxed, there&#8217;ll be less. Taxation
        forces polluters to internalize some of the costs they&#8217;d otherwise
        externalize.</p>
      <p>So far, so good. The devil, however, is in the details. For example,
        who sets the taxes? What algorithm do they use? How quickly can they
        act? To whom are they accountable? And where does the money go?</p>
      <p>When the federal government sets taxes, the key players are the House
        Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. As any observer
        of Congress will tell you, the process of writing tax laws is ugly, contentious,
        and time-consuming. Bills are introduced, hearings held, politics unleashed.
        More than anything else, this is what keeps Washington&#8217;s lobbyists
        on their cell phones.</p>
      <p>What algorithm drives committee members when they write tax laws? Most
        often, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s best for their reelection. They&#8217;re
        not economists, they&#8217;re politicians. They want to please donors
        and voters. Protecting nature, or future generations, isn&#8217;t foremost
        in their minds. Hence, pollution taxes will never be as high as they
        need to be.</p>
      <p>Consider a real example here &#8212; <strong>carbon taxes</strong>. A tax on carbon emissions
        could, in theory, reduce global warming. But in order to make a difference,
        the tax would have to get extremely high. This means Congress would have
        to raise the prices of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity year after
        year, hitting every business and consumer in the pocketbook. That&#8217;s
        an improbable scenario.</p>
      <p>In most situations, mainstream economists would shout, &#8220;Politicians
        shouldn&#8217;t set prices, markets should!&#8221; Prices should announce
        to the world, on any given day, what buyers are willing to pay and sellers
        are willing to accept. To the extent that government distorts or delays
        this process, it leads to inefficient allocation of scarce resources,
        not the least of which is Congress&#8217;s own time.</p>
      <p>So why did Pigou and his followers give the price-setting job to politicians?
        Because, in their minds, there was no alternative. <em>Someone</em> had
        to set prices for pollution, and they thought no one else could do it.
        But there <em>are</em> other options. </p>
      <p>Consider, for example, the Federal Reserve Board, created in 1913 to
        manage the nation&#8217;s money supply. The Fed is a hybrid entity. Technically,
        it&#8217;s a corporation whose stock is owned by member banks. However,
        the seven members of its board of governors are appointed by the president
        and confirmed by the Senate to staggered fourteen-year terms. The genius
        of the Fed is that its governors can make tough economic decisions without
        risking defeat at the polls. In particular, they can raise interest rates,
        which means higher borrowing costs for businesses and higher mortgage
        and credit card payments for millions of voters. No politician wants
        to do this, and thanks to the Fed, none have to. When constituents complain
        about high interest rates, Congress members point to the Fed and say, &#8220;Talk
        to them.&#8221; This model is so sensible that, nowadays, almost all
      countries use it.</p>
      <p>One can imagine similar entities for managing carbon and other pollutants.
        Their governors would serve long terms and have a fiduciary responsibility
        to future generations. They could make tough economic decisions &#8212; such
        as raising energy prices &#8212; without committing political suicide.
        Such entities might appeal to elected politicians precisely because they
        permit a shifting of responsibility and blame.</p>
      <p>And that&#8217;s not the only alternative to political price-setting.
        We know from &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; programs that markets can set
        prices for pollution. In such systems, politicians have an important
        task &#8212; they set up the system and assign the initial property rights &#8212; but
        once they do that, they can be off the hook on prices. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
