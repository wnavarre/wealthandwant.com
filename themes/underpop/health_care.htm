    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.
    ...</p>
  <p>Health Risk Sharing</p>
  <p>Pooled risk sharing, or social insurance, has several advantages over individualized
    risk. One is universality: everyone is covered and assured a dignified existence.
    Another is fairness: when risks are individualized, some people fare well,
    but others do not. There are winners and losers, and the disparities can
    be great.</p>
  <p>Social insurance principles have been applied in America to the risks of
    old-age poverty, temporary unemployment, and disability. In every other capitalist
    democracy, they&#8217;ve been applied to these risks and ill health. The
    United States provides universal health insurance only to people age sixty-five
    and older. Extending this coverage to all Americans would be another pillar
    of the commons sector and make us more of a national community.</p>
  <p>For the benefit of U.S. readers, it&#8217;s worth describing how universal
    health insurance works. Take our northern neighbor as a case in point. In
    1984, the Canadian Parliament unanimously passed the Canada Health Act, designed
    to ensure that all residents of Canada have access to necessary hospital
    and physician services on a prepaid basis. Each province now runs its own
    insurance program in accordance with five federal principles:</p>
  <p> * Universal. All residents are covered.<br>
  * Comprehensive. All medically necessary services are covered.<br>
  * Not-for-profit. Each provincial plan is not-for-profit.<br>
  * Accessible. Premiums are affordable or subsidized.<br>
  * Portable. Coverage continues when a person travels.</p>
  <p>The act also bans extra billing by medical practitioners. As a result, the
    system is incredibly simple. For routine doctor visits, Canadians need only
    present their health card. There are no forms to fill out or bills to pay.
    The system is financed by a combination of federal and provincial funds.
    The provinces raise part of their funds by charging monthly premiums.</p>
  <p>I compared monthly premiums in 2005 for families of four in California (through
    Aetna) and in British Columbia (through the provincial health plan). For
    the California family, the rate was $1,045 when the head of household is
    age forty-five; for the Canadian family, the rate was $88 no matter what
    the age of the parents (see figure 7.1). Discounts are available to low-income
    families.</p>

  <p>    It&#8217;s important to note that in Canada, unlike Britain, there&#8217;s
    no National Health Service. Medical providers work for themselves, or for
    private clinics and hospitals. Customers can freely choose their doctors,
    hospitals, and other practitioners. The only thing that&#8217;s been added
    to the commons is the risk-sharing system.</p>
  <p>Here&#8217;s the bottom line. All Canadians get health care and peace of
    mind at a per capita cost that&#8217;s about 45 percent lower than ours.
    Canada lays out less than ten cents of every health care dollar on administration,
    while we spend nearly thirty cents (and that doesn&#8217;t include the time
    and energy patients themselves spend on paperwork). What&#8217;s more, our
    health care system doesn&#8217;t even keep us healthy. Our infant mortality
    rate is higher than Canada&#8217;s, our life expectancy is lower, and we
    have proportionally more obesity, cancer, diabetes, and depression. To top
    it off, forty-five million of us have no health insurance at all.</p>
  <p>What can we learn from this comparison? Social insurance
                                                enables members of a community
        to reduce common risks more cheaply
                                                    and efficiently than private
            insurance does. It&#8217;s
                                                    thus a vital piece of social
            infrastructure. This is especially
                                                    so when we want
                                                      coverage
                                                            to be
                                                            universal. Some of
            the savings

<blockquote>
  <p>    Patently Unscientific</p>
  <p>Enclosure of the commons has also been occurring in the world of science.
    Here, too, the Founders&#8217; intentions were clear. Ben Franklin, no slouch
    when it came to the dollar, never sought a patent on his most famous invention,
    the Franklin stove. &#8220;As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions
    of others,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;we should be glad to serve others by any
    invention of ours.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson, who served as first head of the
    U.S. Patent Office, believed the purpose of the office was to promulgate
    inventions, not protect them. He rejected nearly half the applications submitted
    during his term. (Eli Whitney&#8217;s cotton gin made it through.)</p>
  <p>As with copyrights, this stringent approach to patents worked well for a
    long time. America didn&#8217;t lack inventiveness in the nineteenth and
    early twentieth centuries (and let it be remembered that we stole much of
    our early technology from the British). But from midcentury to the present,
    patenting has become a national pastime. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which
    let universities get patents on taxpayer-funded research and license those
    patents to corporations, opened the floodgates. Corporate money rushed into
    academic labs, and with it came a corporate mindset. Where scientists once
    shared their discoveries openly, many now fear to discuss them, lest someone
    beat them to the patent office. Today, some say, the secrecy is so intense
    and the thicket of property rights so dense that the advancement of research
    has noticeably slowed.</p>
  <p>The U.S. Patent Office has gone along with this, issuing patents for everything
    from one-click shopping on the Internet to genes that are 99 percent nature-made.
    Often, companies get patents not with the intention of developing them, but
    rather with the intention of suing someone else who might (a practice known
    as patent trolling). Figure 8.1 shows the dramatic rise in number of patents
    issued over the past few decades.</p>
  <p>Consumers and taxpayers are burdened as well. Thanks to patents, pharmaceutical
    companies can charge monopoly prices for up to twenty years after introducing
    a new drug. This is said to benefit society by providing incentives for research,
    but according to the Center for Economic Policy Research, the benefit is
    greatly exceeded by the cost. Pharmaceutical companies spend about $25 billion
    a year on research, of which about 70 percent is for copycat drugs that mimic
    competitors&#8217; brands and add no significant health benefits.</p>
  <p>The federal government could fund 100 percent of noncopycat research &#8212; and
    place the resulting drugs in the public domain &#8212; entirely from cost
    savings to Medicare and Medicaid. On top of that, the savings to consumers
    from lower drug costs would amount to hundreds of billions of dollars each
    year.</p>
  <p>To release science from corporate control, we need to take a twofold approach:
    apply more stringent standards for issuing patents, and provide more public
    funds for research (with the proviso that publicly funded discoveries stay
    in the public domain). The track record for publicly funded research has,
    in fact, been phenomenal. The entire computer industry was spawned by the
    U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, which produced the first digital computer in 1945.
    Similarly, the Internet emerged from the Defense Advanced Research Projects
    Agency and the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. It&#8217;s hard
    to imagine the modern world without either of these breakthroughs, or with
    the Internet being owned, say, by Verizon or TimeWarner. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
