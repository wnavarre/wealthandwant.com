<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers and
      their employers. But working for wages is not the primary or exclusive
      occupation of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention
      of an employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of labor,
      the man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving his
      wages in the fruits of his labor. Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers,
      peddlers, working farmers &#8212; all, in short, of the many workers who
      get their wages directly by the sale of their services or products without
      the medium of an employer, as much laborers as those who work for the specific
      wages of an employer? In your consideration of remedies you do not seem
      even to have thought of them. Yet in reality the laborers who work for
      themselves are the first to be considered, since what men will be willing
      to accept from employers depends manifestly on what they can get by working
      for themselves.</p>
  <p>You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much higher
    were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great majority
    of employers are in reality as much pressed by competition as their workmen,
    many of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such employers could not
    possibly raise the wages they pay, however they might wish to, unless all
    others were compelled to do so.</p>
  <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
    the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
                  in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
                  however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
                  natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
                  are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
                  and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
                  between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
                  men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p><strong>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide
      with differences in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference
      between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</strong> </p>
  <p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
    of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
    on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
    in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
    living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
    in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
    and one of the inferior animals? <strong>Our American apologists for slavery
    used to contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated
    the intent of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference
    that you assume to be natural is between men of the same race. What difference
    does nature show between such men as would indicate her intent that one should
    live idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor?</strong> If
    I could bring you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and
    one who is glad to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by
    side in your antechamber, would you be able to tell which was which, even
    were you to call in the most skilled anatomist? Is it not clear that God
    in no way countenances or condones the division of rich and poor that exists
    today, or in any way permits it, except as having given them free will he
    permits men to choose either good or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer
    hell. <strong>For is it not clear that the division of men into the classes
    rich and poor has invariably its origin in force and fraud; invariably involves
    violation of the moral law; and is really a division into those who get the
    profits of robbery and those who are robbed; those who hold in exclusive
    possession what God made for all, and those who are deprived of his bounty? </strong>Did
    not Christ in all his utterances and parables show that the gross difference
    between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s law? Would he have condemned
    the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction between rich and
    poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s intent?
    <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
      than their share of labor on others.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
      as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
      their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same
      right of excluding their fellows.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that
        all men are children of God the common Father; that all have the same
        last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the
      unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet in all
      this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
      of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
      and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
      give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
    made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
    gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
    that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
    Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
    priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
    of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
    grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? </p>

    themed collection of
excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> IF we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all
  here with an equal title to the enjoyment of His bounty &#8212; with an equal
  right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
  which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human
  being as he enters the world, and which, during his continuance in the world,
  can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
  thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
  make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
  to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
  who follow them. For what are we but tenants for a day? Have we made the earth
  that we should determine the rights of those who after us shall tenant it in
  their turn? The Almighty, who created the earth for man and man for the earth,
  has entailed it upon all the generations of the children of men by a decree
  written upon the constitution of all things &#8212; a decree which no human
  action can bar and no prescription determine, Let the parchments be ever so
  many, or possession ever so long, natural justice can recognize no right in
  one man to the possession and enjoyment of land that is not equally the right
  of all his fellows. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> HAS the first comer at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs
    and claim that none of the other guests shall partake of the food provided,
    except as they make terms with him? Does the first man who presents a ticket
    at the door of a theater and passes in, acquire by his priority the right
    to shut the doors and have the performance go on for him alone? Does the
    first passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his
    baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after him
    to stand up? <br>
              <br>
  The cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests at a banquet
  continually spread, spectators and participants in an entertainment where there
  is room for all who come; passengers from station to station, on an orb that
  whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess cannot be exclusive;
  they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights of others. Just as the
  passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and his baggage over as many
  seats as he pleases, until other passengers come in, so may a settler take
  and use as much land as he chooses, until it is needed by others &#8212; a
  fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when his right must
  be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation
  can give a right which will bar these equal rights of others. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>GREAT as John Stuart Mill was and pure as he was &#8212; warm heart and noble
    mind &#8212; he yet never saw the true harmony of economic laws, nor realized
    how from this one great fundamental wrong flow want and misery, and vice and
    shame. Else he could never have written this sentence: "The land of Ireland,
    the land of every country, belongs to the people of that country. The individuals
    called landowners have no right in morality and justice to anything but the
    rent, or compensation for its salable value." <br>
            <br>
          In the name of the Prophet &#8212; figs! If the land of any country
              belong to the people of that country, what right, in morality and
              justice, have the individuals
  called landowners to the rent? If the land belong to the people, why in the
              name of morality and justice should the people pay its salable
              value for their own? <br>
            <br>
          Herbert Spencer says: "Had we to deal with the parties who originally robbed
  the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter?" Why
  not make short work of the matter anyhow? For this robbery is not like the
  robbery of a horse or a sum of money, that ceases with the act. It is a fresh
  and continuous
  robbery, that goes on every day and every hour. It is not from the produce
  of the past that rent is drawn; it is from the produce of the present. It is
  a toll
  levied upon labor constantly and continuously. Every blow of the hammer, every
  stroke of the pick, every thrust of the shuttle, every throb of the steam engine
  pay it tribute. It levies upon the earnings of the men who, deep underground,
  risk their lives, and of those who over white surges hang to reeling masts;
  it claims the just reward of the capitalist and the fruits of the inventor's
  patient
  effort; it takes little children from play and from school, and compels them
  to work before their bones are hard or their muscles are firm; it robs the
  shivering of warmth; the hungry, of food; the sick, of medicine; the anxious,
  of peace.
  It debases, and embrutes, and embitters. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book
