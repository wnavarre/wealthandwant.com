        <div align="left">
          <p>THE term Labor includes all human exertion in the production
                            of wealth, whatever its mode. In common parlance
            we often speak of brain labor and hand labor as though they were
            entirely distinct kinds
                        of exertion,
                            and labor is often spoken of as though it involved
            only muscular exertion. But in reality any form of labor, that is
            to say, any form of human
                        exertion in the production of wealth above that which
            cattle may be applied to doing,
                            requires the human brain as truly as the human hand,
            and would be impossible without the exercise of mental faculties
            on the part of the laborer.
                        Labor in fact is only physical in external form. In its
            origin it is mental or
                            on strict analysis spiritual. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe316.html">unabridged:

                            Second Factor of Production &#8212; Labor</a> &#8226;</em> <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_10.htm">abridged:

            IT seems to us that your Holiness misses its real
                              significance in intimating that Christ in becoming
                              the son of a carpenter and
                                Himself working as a carpenter
                      showed merely that "there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one's bread
                      by labor." To say that is almost like saying that by not
                      robbing people He showed that there is nothing to be ashamed
                      of in honesty.<strong> If you will consider
                      how true
                      in any large view is the classification of all men into
                      working-men, beggar-men and thieves, you will see that
                      it was morally impossible that Christ during
                      His stay on earth should have been anything else than a
                      working-man, since He who
                      came to fulfill the law must by deed as well as word obey
                      God's law of labor.</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
See how fully and how beautifully Christ's life on earth illustrated
          this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as
          it is appointed
                      that
                      all should enter it, He lovingly took what in the natural
          order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that
          one generation owes to its
                      immediate successors.
                      Arrived at maturity, He earned His own subsistence by that
          common labor in which the majority of men must and do earn it. Then
          passing to a higher &#8212; to
                      the very highest &#8212; sphere of labor. He earned His
                      subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual truths,
                      receiving its material wages in the love offerings
                      of grateful hearers, and not refusing the costly spikenard
                      with which Mary anointed his feet. So, when He chose His
                      disciples, He did not go to land-owners or other
                      monopolists who live on the labor of others but to common
                      laboring men. And when He called them to a higher sphere
                      of labor and sent them out to teach moral and
                      spiritual truths He told them to take, without condescension
                      on the one hand, or sense of degradation on the other,
                      the loving return for such labor, saying
                      to them that the "laborer is worthy of his hire," thus
                      showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist
                      in what is called manual labor, but that
                      whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral,
                      or spiritual fulness of life
                      is also a laborer. - <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
                      Condition of Labor</a><br>
            <br>
            NOR should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher,
                      the teacher, the artist, the poet, the priest, though not
                      engaged in the
                          production of wealth,
                      are not only engaged in the production of utilities and
                      satisfactions to which the production of wealth is only
                      a means, but by acquiring and
                          diffusing knowledge,
                      stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral sense,
                      may greatly increase the ability to produce wealth. For
                      man does not live by bread alone. He is
                          not an engine, in which so much fuel gives so much
                      power. On a capstan bar or a topsail
                      halyard a good song tells like muscle, and a "Marseillaise" or a "Battle Hymn
                      of the Republic" counts for bayonets. A hearty laugh, a
                      noble thought, a perception of harmony, may add to the
                      power of dealing even with material
                      things. <br>
            <br>
            He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate
                      of enjoyable wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge
                      or gives to human life higher
                          elevation
                      or greater fulness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning
                      of the words, a "producer," a "working-man," a "laborer," and
                      is honestly earning honest wages. <strong>But he who without
                      doing aught to make mankind richer, wiser, better, happier,
                      lives
                      on the toil of others &#8212; he,
                      no matter by what name of honor he may be I called, or
                      how lustily the priests
                      of Mammon
                      may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis
                      but a beggarman or a thie</strong>f. &#8212; <em>Protection
