<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
      of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
      sanctioned
    by Divine Law.</strong> (11.)</p>
  <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
    property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
    practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
  <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
    the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
    to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
    right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
    sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
    among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
    used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
    was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
    but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
    in and take it on like tenure. <strong>Of the same nature were the land laws of the
    Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
    by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
    fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</strong></p>
  <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the same
    right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor, has never
    grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery, it is the result
    of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
    whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
  <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of
    the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
    there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in
    land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. The
    sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of
    land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved
    duties or payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea
    that we would carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public
    uses. The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church
    lands defrayed the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief
    of the sick, the destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided
    for public defense and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion
    of the land remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free
    to pasture it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
  <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land is
    to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were rude,
    wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought
    of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which
    despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England, the highest
    authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that
    in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so helpless, so pressed
    and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth century;
    and that, save in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as
    to fear that his wife and children might come to want even were he taken
    from them. Dark and rude in many respects as they were, these were the times
    when the cathedrals and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite
    our admiration were built; the times when England had no national debt, no
    poor law, no standing army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands
    of human beings rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay
    their heads at night.</p>
  <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
    that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
    that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that
    the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in
    Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted
    in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and
    that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time
    all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners;
    while the same private ownership of land was extended over Ireland and the
    Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs.
    Even the military dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today
    have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses without one penny of other
    taxation.</p>
  <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is
    only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is
    due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large
    plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of
    slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
    English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
    manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of
    the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that land was
    to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established in English
    thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so treated by the
    United States and by the several States. And though land was at first sold
    cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also sold in large quantities
    to speculators, given away in great tracts for railroads and other purposes,
    until now the public domain of the United States, which a generation ago
    seemed illimitable, has practically gone. And this, as the experience of
    other countries shows, is the natural result in a growing community of making
    land private property. When the possession of land means the gain of unearned
    wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose,
    economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by
    the state for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands
    of users and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
    will be profitable only to users.</p>
  <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
    of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
    that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
    while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes
    the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
    civilization.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
    ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt not covet
    thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant,
    nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
    field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
    exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
    man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
    for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms
    referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. But
    the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and improvement, to
    which the right of possession and ownership does attach without recognition
    of property in the land itself. And that this reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is
    not a sanction of private property in land as it exists today is proved by
    the fact that the Mosaic code expressly denied such unqualified ownership
    in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the land also shall not be sold
    forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided
    for its reversion every fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive
    industrial conditions of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a
    foothold in the soil.</p>
  <p><strong>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
    be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that justly
    attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated as the
    free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221; ...</strong></p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. T<strong>he real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</strong></p>
  <p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
    of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
    on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
    in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
    living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
    in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
    and one of the inferior animals? Our American apologists for slavery used
    to contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated the
    intent of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference
    that you assume to be natural is between men of the same race. <strong>What
    difference does nature show between such men as would indicate her intent
    that one should
    live idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor?</strong> If
    I could bring you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and
    one who
    is glad to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by side in
    your antechamber, would you be able to tell which was which, even were you
    to call in the most skilled anatomist? Is it not clear that God in no way
    countenances or condones the division of rich and poor that exists today,
    or in any way permits it, except as having given them free will he permits
    men to choose either good or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer hell.
    <strong>For is it not clear that the division of men into the classes rich
    and poor has invariably its origin in force and fraud; invariably involves
    violation
    of the moral law; and is really a division into those who get the profits
    of robbery and those who are robbed; those who hold in exclusive possession
    what God made for all, and those who are deprived of his bounty? </strong>Did
    not Christ in all his utterances and parables show that the gross difference
    between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s law? Would he have condemned
    the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction between rich and
    poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s intent?

  <p> OR let him go to Edinburgh, the &quot;modern Athens,&quot; of which Scotsmen
    speak with pride, and in buildings from whose roofs a bowman might strike
    the spires of twenty churches he will find human beings living as he would
    not keep his meanest dog. Let him toil up the stairs of one of those monstrous
    buildings, let him enter one of those &quot;dark houses,&quot; let him close
    the door, and in the blackness think what life must be in such a place. Then
    let him try the reduction to iniquity. And if he go to that good charity
    (but, alas! how futile is Charity without Justice!) where little children
    are kept while their mothers are at work, and children are fed who would
    otherwise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs are shrunken from want
    of nourishment. Perhaps they may tell him, as they told me, of that little
    girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who, when they gave her bread, raised
    her eyes and clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Heaven for His
    bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think, of its terrible
    meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child, thankful for
    that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard? If
    not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
    bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
    to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths
    of the sea? &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll),
    The Nineteenth Century, July, 1884</p>
  <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries
    we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we
    take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization large
    classes should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority
    should only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toil. There are
    professors of political economy who teach that this condition of things is
    the result of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are ministers
    of religion who preach that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful
    Creator intended for His children! If an architect were to build a theater
    so that not more than one-tenth of the audience could see and hear, we should
    call him a bungler and a botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide
    so little food that nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should
    call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even
    the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great Architect
    of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature testifies, has made such
    a botch job of this world that the vast majority of the human creatures whom
    He has called into it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want,
    suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development
    of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely
    live! &#8212; Social Problems ... <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">go
