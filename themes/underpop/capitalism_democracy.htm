<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m also a liberal, in the sense that I&#8217;m not averse to a role
    for government in society. Yet history has convinced me that representative
    government can&#8217;t adequately protect the interests of ordinary citizens.
    Even less can it protect the interests of future generations, ecosystems,
    and nonhuman species. The reason is that most &#8212; though not all &#8212; of
    the time, government puts the interests of private corporations first. This
    is a systemic problem of a capitalist democracy, not just a matter of electing
    new leaders.</p>
  <p>If you identify with the preceding sentiments, then you might be
              confused and demoralized, as I have been lately. If capitalism
          as we know
                it is deeply flawed, and government is no savior, where lies
          hope? This strikes
                  me as
                    one of the great dilemmas of our time. For years the Right
              has been saying &#8212; nay,
                    shouting &#8212; that government is flawed and that only
                    privatization, deregulation, and tax cuts can save us. For
                    just as long, the Left has been insisting that
                    markets are flawed and that only government can save us.
                    The trouble is that both sides are half-right and half-wrong.
                    They&#8217;re both right that markets
                    and state are flawed, and both wrong that salvation lies
                    in either sphere. But if that&#8217;s the case, what are
                    we to do? Is there, perhaps, a missing set of institutions
        that can help us? ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The notion that government should protect the commons goes back a long way.
    Sometimes this duty is considered so basic it&#8217;s taken for granted.
    At other times, it&#8217;s given a name: the public trust. Several states
    actually put this duty in writing. Pennsylvania&#8217;s constitution, for
    example, declares: &#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s public natural resources are
    the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come.
    As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain
    them for the benefit of all the people.&#8221; Note that in this constitutional
    dictum, serving as trustee of natural resources isn&#8217;t an option for
    the state, it&#8217;s an affirmative duty.</p>
  <p>Yet here as elsewhere, rhetoric and reality differ. Political institutions
    don&#8217;t function in a vacuum; they function in a world in which power
    is linked to property. This was true when fifty-five white male property
    owners wrote our Constitution, and it&#8217;s no less true today.</p>
  <p>America has been engaged in two experiments simultaneously: one is called
    democracy, the other, capitalism. It would be nice if these experiments ran
    separately, but they don&#8217;t. They go on in the same bottle, and each
    affects the other. After two hundred years, we can draw some conclusions
    about how they interact. One is that capitalism distorts democracy more than
    the other way around.</p>
  <p>The reason capitalism distorts democracy is simple. Democracy is an open
    system, and economic power can easily infect it. By contrast, capitalism
    is a gated system; its bastions aren&#8217;t easily accessed by the masses.
    Capital&#8217;s primacy thus isn&#8217;t an accident, nor the fault of George
    W. Bush. It&#8217;s what happens when capitalism inhabits democracy.</p>
  <p>This isn&#8217;t to say the United States government can&#8217;t, at times,
    restrain corporations. It has a number of tools at its disposal, and has
    used them in the past with some success. But the measures it can take are
    woefully inadequate to the task of safeguarding the planet for our children.
    Let&#8217;s see why. ....</p>
  <p>Three points are worth making here.</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> First, ownership isn&#8217;t the same thing as trusteeship. Owners of
              property &#8212; even government owners &#8212; have wide latitude to
              do whatever they want with it; a trustee does not. Trustees are bound
              by the
              terms of their trust and by centuries-old principles of trusteeship,
              foremost among which is &#8220;undivided loyalty&#8221; to beneficiaries.</li>
      <li> Second, in a capitalist democracy, the state is a dispenser of many
              valuable prizes. Whoever amasses the most political power wins
        the most valuable prizes.
            The rewards include property rights, friendly regulators, subsidies,
            tax breaks, and free or cheap use of the commons. The notion that
        the state
              promotes &#8220;the
            common good&#8221; is sadly naive.</li>
      <li> Third, while free marketers are fond of saying that capitalism is
        a precondition for democracy, what they neglect to add is that capitalism
                  also distorts democracy.
                  Like gravity, its tug is constant. The bigger the concentrations
          of capital, the stronger the tug.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>We face a disheartening quandary here. Profit-maximizing corporations dominate
          our economy. Their programming makes them enclose and diminish common wealth.
          The only obvious counterweight is government, yet government is dominated
        by these same corporations.</p>
      <p>One possible way out of this dilemma is to reprogram corporations &#8212; that
          is, to make them driven by something other than profit. This, however, is
          like asking elephants to dance &#8212; they&#8217;re just not built to do
          it. Corporations are built to make money, and the truth is, as a society
          we want them to make money. We&#8217;ll look at this further in the next
        chapter.</p>
      <p>Another possible way out is to liberate government from corporations, not
          just momentarily, but long-lastingly. This is easier said than done. Corporations
          have decimated their old adversary, organized labor, and turned the media
          into their mouthpiece. Occasionally a breakthrough is made in campaign financing &#8212; for
          example, corporations are now barred from giving so-called soft money to
          political parties &#8212; but corporate money soon finds other channels to
        flow through. The return on such investments is simply too high to stop them.</p>
      <p>Does this mean there&#8217;s no hope? I don&#8217;t think so. The window
          of opportunity is small, but not nonexistent. Throughout American history,
          anticorporate forces have come to power once or twice per century. In the
          nineteenth century, we had the eras of Jackson and Lincoln; in the twentieth
          century, those of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty-first century equivalents
          will, I&#8217;m sure, arise. It may take a calamity of some sort &#8212; another
          war, a depression, or an ecological disaster &#8212; to trigger the next
          anticorporate ascendancy, but sooner or later it will come. Our job is to
          be ready when it comes. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
