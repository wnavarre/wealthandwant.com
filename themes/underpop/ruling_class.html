    <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political
    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em></strong>,
1883)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural.  Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of the citizen, and  political organization always starts from this base. It is as social  development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make  the many the slaves of the few. How this is we may see. In all  institutions which involve the lodgment of governing power there is,  with social growth, a tendency to the exaltation of their function and  the centralization of their power, and in the stronger of these  institutions a tendency to the absorption of the powers of the rest.  <strong>Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government the business  of a special class.</strong> And as numbers increase and the power and  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all,  so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny  and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head  man of a little village, can command or govern only by common consent,  and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his fellows. But when a  tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a populous country,  the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition, become  practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to  appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes  irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as power thus  concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and <strong>the habit of thought grows  up which regards the masses as born but for the service of their rulers.</strong><br>
          <br>
          <span class="style1">[07] </span><strong>Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual  conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the  people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &mdash;  though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles and a  hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and  hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but  follow it. </strong>The same methods which, in a little town where each knows  his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city,  as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers  to gain and hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and  even in our State legislatures, the growth of the country and the  greater number of interests make the proportion of the votes of a  representative, of which his constituents know or care to know, less  and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial departments tend  constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.</p>
      <p>        <span class="style1">[08] </span>But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the  changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of  steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the  concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by  hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;  small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen  of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues  and payrolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this  concentration grows the facility of combination among these great  business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal  operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers, combine,  either to regulate prices or to use the powers of government! The  tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation of rings  against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[09] </span>It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great  aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to  corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of the  people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars &mdash; except two  million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in power, no  matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for reform, for it  instinctively fears change. It never struggles against misgovernment.  When threatened by the holders of political power it does not agitate,  nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is in this way, no less  than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth corrupts  government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our organized lobbies,  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon  the hopes of moneyed interests. When "business" is dull, their resource  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat.  So, too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political  funds, on the principle of keeping on the right side of those in power,  just as the railroad companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes  to Florida to fish.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[10] </span>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence. A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[11] </span>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the  aggregation of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations,  necessarily implies the loss by the people of governmental control.  Democratic forms may be maintained, but there can be as much tyranny  and misgovernment under democratic forms as any other &mdash; in fact, they  lend themselves most readily to tyranny and misgovernment. Forms count  for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and continued to abhor the  very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators,  that at first meant no more than our "Boss," they crouched before  tyrants more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular  name of "bosses," developed political C&aelig;sars in municipalities  and states. If this development continues, in time there will come a  national boss. We are young but we are growing. The day may arrive when  the "Boss of America" will be to the modern world what C&aelig;sar was  to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic government  in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with  something like equality &mdash; where the great mass of citizens are  personally free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor  made subject by their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a  property qualification. The man who is dependent on a master for his  living is not a free man. To give the suffrage to slaves is only to  give votes to their owners. That universal suffrage may add to, instead  of decreasing, the political power of wealth we see when mill-owners  and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn, without fear  or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to vote.  Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a  square inch of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and. urged by  starvation, must bid against his fellows for the privilege of using  them? When it comes to voting tramps. some principle has been carried  to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme. I have known elections to be  decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse to the polls. But  such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
