<blockquote>
  <p>George was moreover the terror of the political routineer. When the Republicans
    suddenly raised the tariff issue in 1880 the Democratic committee asked him
    to go on the stump. They arranged a long list of engagements for him, but after
    he made one speech they begged him by telegraph not to make any more. The nub
    of his speech was that he had heard of high-tariff Democrats and revenue-tariff
    Democrats, but he was a no-tariff Democrat who wanted real free trade, and
    he was out for that or nothing; and naturally no good bi-partisan national
    committee could put up with such talk as that, especially from a man who really
  meant it.</p>
  <p>Yet, on the other hand, when the official free-traders of the Atlantic seaboard,
    led by Sumner, Godkin, Beecher, Curtis, Lowell, and Hewitt, opened their
    arms to George, he refused to fall in. His free-trade speeches during Cleveland&#8217;s
    second campaign were really devoted to showing by implication that they were
    a hollow lot, and that their idea of free trade was nothing more or less than
    a humbug. His speeches hurt Cleveland more than they helped him, and some of
    George&#8217;s closest associates split with him at this point. In George&#8217;s
    view, freedom of exchange would not benefit the masses of the people a particle
    unless it were correlated with freedom of production; if it would, how was
    it that the people of free-trade England, for example, were no better off
    than the people of protectionist Germany! None of the official free-traders
    could
    answer that question, of course, for there was no answer. George had already
    developed his full doctrine of trade in a book, published in 1886, called <em>Protection
    or Free Trade</em> &#8212; a book which, incidentally, gives a reader the
    best possible introduction to <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. ...<a href="../../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a><br>
