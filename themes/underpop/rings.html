    <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political
    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em></strong>,
1883)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span class="style1">[07] </span>Thus the mere growth  of society involves danger of the gradual conversion of government into  something independent of and beyond the people, and the gradual seizure  of its powers by a ruling class &mdash; though not necessarily a class marked  off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history shows,  personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the  concentration of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a  little town where each knows his neighbor and matters of common  interest are under the common eye, enable the citizens freely to govern  themselves, may, in a great city, as we have in many cases seen, enable  an organized ring of plunderers to gain and hold the government. So,  too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the  growth of the country and the greater number of interests make the  proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents  know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and  judicial departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the  people.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[08] </span>But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the  changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of  steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the  concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by  hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;  small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen  of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues  and pay-rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this  concentration grows the facility of combination among these great  business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal  operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers, combine,  either to regulate prices or to use the powers of government! The  tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation of rings  against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served. </p>
      <p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
  of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
  it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
  earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
  to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
  gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
  is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
  the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
  competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
  their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
  in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
  a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
  the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
  doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
  time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
  chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
  due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
  in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
