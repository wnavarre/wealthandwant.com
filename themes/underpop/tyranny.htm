  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">WE should keep our own market for our
      own producers</span>, seems by many to be regarded as the same kind of
      a proposition as,<span style="font-style: italic;"> We should keep our
      own pasture for our own cows</span>; whereas, in truth, it is such a proposition
      as, <span style="font-style: italic;">We should keep our own appetites
      for our own cookery</span>, or, <span style="font-style: italic;">We should
      keep our own transportation for our own legs</span>. &#8212; <em>Protection

THE protection of the masses has in all times been the pretense of tyranny &#8212; the
plea of monarchy, of aristocracy, of special privilege of every kind. The slave
owners justified slavery as protecting the slaves. British misrule in Ireland
is upheld on the ground that it is for the protection of the Irish. But, whether
under a monarchy or under a republic, is there an instance in the history of
the world in which the "protection" of the laboring masses has not meant their
oppression? The protection that those who have got the law-making power into
their hands have given labor, has at best always been the protection that man
gives to cattle &#8212; he protects them that he may use and eat them. &#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 2, Clearing Ground&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT2.html">econlib </a><br />

IT is never intimated that the land-owner or the capitalist needs protection.
They, it is always assumed, can take care of themselves. It is only the poor
workingman who must be protected. What is labor that it should so need protection?
Is not labor the creator of capital, the producer of all wealth? Is it not the
men who labor that feed and clothe all others? Is it not true, as has been said,
that the three great orders of society are "workingmen, beggarmen, and thieves?" How,
then, does it come that workingmen alone need protection? &#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 2, Clearing Ground&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT2.html">econlib </a>-|- <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/trade/pft2.htm">abridged</a><br />
            <br />
WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a country which
should compel each family to keep constantly on their guard against every other
family, to expend a large part of their time and labor in preventing exchanges
with their neighbors, and to seek their own prosperity by opposing the natural
efforts of other families to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies
that laws such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families of
men who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws, as immutable
as the physical laws, each nation must stand jealously on guard against every
other nation and erect artificial obstacles to national intercourse.&#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 4: Protection as a Universal Need&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT4.html">econlib </a><br />
            <br />
TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying from other
nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make a man prosperous by preventing
him from buying from other men. How this operates in the case of the individual
we can see from that practice which, since its application in the Irish land
agitation, has come to be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has
been thrust the unenviable fame of having his name turned into a verb, was in
fact "protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind built
around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act of Parliament. No
one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk or bread or meat or any
service or commodity whatever. But instead of growing prosperous, this much-protected
man had to fly from a place where his own market was thus reserved for his own
productions. What protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home
market for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain Boycott.
They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,
Chapter 11: The Home Market and Home Trade - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT11.html">econlib</a><br />
            <br />
WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to take a certain
course is proof that it ought to take that course, and restrictions are harmful
because they restrict, and in proportion as they restrict. To assert that the
way for men to become healthy and strong is for them to force into their stomachs
what nature tries to reject, to regulate the play of their lungs by bandages,
or to control the circulation of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit
more absurd than to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them
to restrict the natural tendency to trade. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,
