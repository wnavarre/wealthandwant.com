<p align="center"><strong>Land Value Taxation as Primary Revenue Source</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are people who suggest that since a tax on land value today might not
      be sufficient to meet <em>all</em> the revenue needs of government at all levels, we
      shouldn't even be seriously considering land value taxation. This strikes those
      who think seriously about the matter as very shallow reasoning. </p>
  <p><strong>If there is a form of taxation which is clearly superior to the alternatives,
      why would we <em>not</em> make it our primary revenue source, even if it
      alone is not sufficient to meet all our revenue needs?</strong> (And there are many
      who will
      make the argument &#8212; a fair one, I think &#8212; that the implementation
      of this reform would have many effects which would reduce the need for
      many of the social services we currently provide to those who are victims
      of our
      current structure. Many costs of government would go away.)</p>
  <p>If land value taxation is insufficient to completely meet our revenue needs,
      well, let's use it anyway. If it supplies 30% and we must find other sources
      for the other 70%, fine. If it supplies 50% and we must find other sources
      for the other 50%, fine. If it supplies 70% and we must find other sources
      for the other 30%, fine. We should rely first on non-distorting taxes before
      we supplement with distorting ones. We should rely first on just taxes
    before we turn to unjust ones. We should rely first on taxes that align our
    incentives
      in directions we need to go (e.g., slowing, even reversing urban sprawl;
    increasing urban density to facilitate more and better public transportation;
    lower housing
      costs, etc.).</p>

    A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
      of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
      potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
      not is as yet an unimportant question. <strong>If all revenues ought to
      be raised from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other
      sources while any land value remains in private possession. Until land
      values are exhausted the taxation of labor cannot be excused. </strong>... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

  <p><em>Q48. But would it not be an injustice to the landowner?</em><br>
A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes (wages) to maintain an unearned
  income (net economic rent) that bears no tax burden, how can it be an injustice
  to stop doing so? There can be no injustice in taking for the benefit of the
  community the value that is created by the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q49. What is the lesson of the inevitable &quot;capitalization&quot; of
    the land tax?</em><br>
    A. It is that an unfair discrimination in favor of the landowner can never
    be overcome until all taxes are paid out of ground rent; then all men will
    enjoy total exemption equally with the landowner.</p>

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
        interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: I want to follow-up on what you had said some months ago about land reform:</p>
  <p>JES: &quot;The main, underlying idea of Henry George is the taxation of
    land and other natural resources. At the time, people thought, &quot;not
    really that too,&quot; but what was underlying his ideas is rent associated
    with things that are inelastically supplied, which are land and natural resources.
    And using natural resource extraction and using land rents as the basis of
    taxation is an argument that I think makes an awful lot of sense because
    it is a non-distortionary source of income and wealth.</p>
  <p>Q: In Globalization and its Discontents, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ...</p>
  <p>Q: I wanted to ask your view on the adequacy of land as a tax base. At one
    time, as you know, there was a &quot;Single Tax&quot; movement, for the purpose
    of deriving revenues sufficient to run the government solely from land value
    taxation. In your view, how feasible is that today?</p>
  <p>JES: Most economists would say that you cannot run the US economy
                on the &quot;Single
                      Tax.&quot; In my mind, the &quot;Single Tax&quot; is the wrong way to think
                      about it. The question is: &quot;Would it be better if we had more taxation
                      of land and natural resource, and more revenue from natural resource management,
                      and I would include atmosphere and spectrum.&quot; And less tax on income
                      and savings. And I would say, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I think many economists
                      would agree with that. So, if you want to sell it as a &quot;Single Tax,&quot; then,
                      no, you won't get anyone to agree that there's enough revenue there. If you
                      look at is a more &quot;central&quot; tax, then, yes, you
                      will get most economists to agree with you.</p>
