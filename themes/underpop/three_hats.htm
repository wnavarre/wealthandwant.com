<blockquote>
  <p>Each of us may wear more than one hat. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We have our labor, the ability to work,
            and therefore may be Labor. </li>
    <li> If we have been able to save some of our earnings,
                or have inherited someone else's savings, we may have invested
      them, and therefore be Capital. </li>
    <li>Third, we may also be Landholders. While the landholder
                  hat may at first thought be part of being Capital, it is actually
          quite
                different.</li>
  </ul>
      <p>More important, our interests as Labor are very different from our interests
          as Capital and from our interests as Landholders. And we should be conscious
        of whether we are looking for a return on our labor, or on some sort of privilege.  </p>
      <p>By lowering the price of land and eliminating other taxes, it is likely
          that many more of us will be able to save something for future consumption,
          and for investment into others' productivity (capital, on which the return
          is interest, to sustain us in retirement). The demand for labor which will
          result from the more intense use of centrally located land will increase
          wages <em>in this country</em> and increase labor's ability to seek a better
        return.</p>
      <p>The landholder is inert. He doesn't lift a finger or add anything to production.
          Why should he be paid for his non-effort? Why should our young people have
          to pay sellers or landlords a large share of their earnings for access to
          land the sellers and landlords didn't create? (Buildings, particularly ones
          that aren't brand new, aren't all that expensive.) Collect those funds to
          meet our common spending needs, and things will improve for
          all
        of us.</p>
      <p>Many of us have watched as the lot on which we live has appreciated rapidly,
          perhaps producing more addition to our net worth than our labor does. We
          may feel very attached to that appreciation, <em>but we've done nothing
        to earn it</em>.</p>
      <p>Those who have &quot;retired&quot; from work may think that their own interests are
          no longer the interests of labor, that they are now &quot;land&quot; and &quot;capital&quot;
          and that therefore it behooves them to support the privileges landholders
          currently receive. But if they have children, or nieces and nephews, or younger
          neighbors, or think beyond the end of their noses and fingers, ultimately
          the interests of their fellow human beings must compel them to seek justice
        for all, not privilege for some.</p>

  <p>AND while in the nature of things any change from wrong-doing to right-doing
    must entail loss upon those who profit by the wrong-doing, and this can no
    more be prevented than can parallel lines be made to meet; yet it must also
    be remembered that in the nature of things the loss is merely relative, the
    gain absolute. Whoever will examine the subject will see that in the abandonment
    of the present unnatural and unjust method of raising public revenues and
    the adoption of the natural and just method even those who relatively lose

MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would be hard to
find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while the
general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the capitalist. So
true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to put
all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely reduce all great
fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest landowner
in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation would largely reduce his
enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income from
them, and doubtless much personal property in various other shapes. He would
still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system benefits

    those obtaining privileges from the current system, the greater reason why
    this tax reform has not taken place is that the public has not been informed.

  <p><em>Q27. Would working people, whose savings are in savings banks or insurance
    companies which own land or have mortgages upon land, lose by the shrinkage
    in land values?</em><br>
    A. Not if the companies were managed intelligently. Well managed companies
    would shift their investments as they observed the persistent decline of
    land values. They would do it even as soon as conditions appeared which would
    naturally cause land values to shrink. But working people could well afford
    to give all their savings for the permanent employment and high wages that
    the single tax would bring about. It is not working people but idle people
    who would lose anything by the single tax.</p>

  <p><em>Q58. Should not the poor man be compensated for the loss of his land value?</em><br>
    A. No. The reasons are numerous. Among them are the following: The poor man's
      rights in the community and in common property are neither more nor less
      than the rich man's. The better conditions for the poor man which the single
      tax would bring about would more than off-set his loss in land values.
      The poor man has no land values worth speaking of. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from
      nature, not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that
      to take the
      value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
      owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
  <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
    indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
    want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
    of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
    you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
    of land.</p>
  <p>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from nature,
    not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership with possession
    and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
    property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any
    other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
    in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
    to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that
    it came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
    man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively
    to him or to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property,
    which originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
    of the thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
    so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice
    to the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
    They do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is
    but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
    labor.</p>
  <p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any grant from
    the Maker of land? What does nature give to such ownership? how does she
    in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
    of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
    their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and
    another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from
    man and passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression
    of his labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the
    individual; but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed
    before man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men
    come and go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man
    for &#8220;the daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?<br>
    Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from nature.
    Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of morals when it
    is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as it
    is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice
    on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
    of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
  <p>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value of landownership
    for the use of the community, the real injustice is in leaving it in private
    hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</p>
  <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
    for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
    God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited of
    their natural rights can be restored to them, the present owners of land
    shall first be compensated.</p>
  <p><strong>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and
      largely benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists
      are
    much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though the great
    landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general among whom the
    profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges,
    etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers</strong> in
    the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly, more strongly,
    more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or losses would your
    duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you to listen for one moment
    to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
  <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that those
    whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners would
    be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
    alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim
    to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the
    same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest
    of what they before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice
    are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that land is
    really the storehouse that God owes to all his children, you will no more
    listen to any demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses
    would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before
    letting the children of Israel go.</p>
  <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
    of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
    We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
    We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to
    bury their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of
    land values have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus
    got. We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that
    for the future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community
    the rent that to the community is justly due. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it,
    what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. <strong>The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
    deprivation both spring.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes.
      The existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from
      which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. </strong>Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p><strong>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights
      we do not seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by
      faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all. </strong>... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>
