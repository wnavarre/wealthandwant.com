Liberty</span><br>
</div>
<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I want to impress upon those who
    may read this book is this:</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The land question is nowhere a mere local question; it is a universal
      question. It involves the great problem of the distribution of wealth,
      which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by measures which in their nature can have but
    local application. It can be settled only by measures which in their nature
    will apply everywhere.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>It cannot be settled by half-way measures. It can be settled only
    by the acknowledgment of equal rights to land. Upon this basis it can be
    settled easily and permanently.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If the Irish reformers take this ground, they will make their fight
    the common fight of all the peoples; they will concentrate strength and divide
    opposition. They will turn the flank of the system that oppresses them, and
    awake the struggle in its very intrenchments. They will rouse against it
    a force that is like the force of rising tides.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the men of Ireland to do is to proclaim, without limitation
    or evasion, that the land, of natural right, is the common property of the
    whole people, and to propose practical measures which will recognize this
    right in all countries as well as in Ireland.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>What I urge the Land Leagues of the United States to do is to announce
    this great principle as of universal application; to give their movement
    a reference to America as well as to Ireland; to broaden and deepen and strengthen
    it by making it a movement for the regeneration of the world &#8211; a movement
    which shall concentrate and give shape to aspirations that are stirring among
    all nations.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Ask not for Ireland mere charity or sympathy. Let her call be the
    call of <strong>fraternity</strong>: "For yourselves, O brothers, as well
    as for us!" Let her rallying cry awake all who slumber, and rouse to a common
    struggle all who are oppressed. Let it breathe not old hates; let it ring
    and echo with the new hope!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>In many lands her sons are true to her; under many skies her daughters
    burn with the love of her. Lo! the ages bring their opportunity. Let those
    who would honor her bear her banner to the front!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The harp and the shamrock, the golden sunburst on the field of living
    green! emblems of a country without nationality; standard of a people downtrodden
    and oppressed! The hour has come when they may lead the van of the great
    world-struggle. Types of harmony and of ever-springing hope, of light and
    of life! The hour has come when they may stand for something higher than
    local patriotism; something grander than national independence. The hour
    has come when they may stand forth to speak the world's hope, to lead the
    world's advance!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Torn away by pirates, tending in a strange land a heathen master's
    swine, the slave boy, with the spirit of Christ in his heart, praying in
    the snow for those who had enslaved him, and returning to bring to his oppressors
    the message of the gospel, returning with good to give where evil had been
    received, to kindle in the darkness a great light&#8211;this is Ireland's
    patron saint. In his spirit let Ireland's struggle be. Not merely through
    Irish vales and hamlets, but into England, into Scotland, into Wales, wherever
    our common tongue is spoken, let the torch be carried and the word be preached.
    And beyond! The brotherhood of man stops not with differences of speech any
    more than with seas or mountain-chains. A century ago it was ours to speak
    the ringing word. Then it was France's. Now it may be Ireland's, if her sons
    be true.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But wherever, or by whom, the word must be spoken, the standard will
    be raised. No matter what the Irish leaders do or do not do, it is too late
    to settle permanently the question on any basis short of the recognition
    of equal natural right. And, whether the Land Leagues move forward or slink
    back, the agitation must spread to this side of the Atlantic. The Republic,
    the true Republic, is not yet here. But her birth-struggle must soon begin.
    Already, with the hope of her, men's thoughts are stirring.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Not a republic of landlords and peasants; not a republic of millionaires
    and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and some serve. But
    a republic of equal citizens, where competition becomes cooperation, and
    the interdependence of all gives true independence to each; where moral progress
    goes hand in hand with intellectual progress, and material progress elevates
    and enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>And the gospel of deliverance, let us not forget it: it is the gospel
    of love, not of hate. He whom it emancipates will know neither Jew nor Gentile,
    nor Irishman nor Englishman, nor German nor Frenchman, nor European nor American,
    nor difference of color or of race, nor animosities of class or condition.
    Let us set our feet on old prejudices, let us bury the old hates. There have
    been "Holy Alliances" of kings. Let us strive for the Holy Alliance of the
    people.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberty, equality, fraternity! Write
    them on the banners. Let them be for sign and countersign. Without equality,
    liberty cannot be; without fraternity, neither equality nor liberty can be
    achieved.</span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Liberty&#8211;the full freedom of each bounded only by the equal
      freedom of every other!</small></li>
  <li><small>Equality&#8211;the equal right of each to the use and enjoyment
      of all natural opportunities, to all the essentials of happy, healthful,
      human life!</small></li>
  <li><small>Fraternity&#8211;that sympathy which links together those who struggle
      in a noble cause; that would live and let live; that would help as well
      as be helped; that, in seeking the good of all, finds the highest good
      of each!</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"By this sign shall ye conquer!"</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>"We hold these truths to be self-evident&#8211;that all men are
      created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>It is over a century since these words rang out. It is time
          to give them their full, true meaning. Let the standard be lifted that
          all may see it; let the advance be sounded that all may hear it. Let
          those who would fall back, fall back. Let those who would oppose, oppose.
          Everywhere are those who will rally. The stars in their courses fight
          against Sisera!... <a

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
  Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</span></small><br>
<small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>And as the
wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>Thus
association in equality is the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other,</span> must civilization advance. Just as they fail in
this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Only that social adjustment
which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it."&nbsp;
