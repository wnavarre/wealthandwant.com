<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Differing from all these are those for whom I would speak. Believing that
    the rights of true property are sacred, we would regard forcible communism
    as robbery that would bring destruction. But we would not be disposed to
    deny that voluntary communism might be the highest possible state of which
    men can conceive. Nor do we say that it cannot be possible for mankind to
    attain it, since among the early Christians and among the religious orders
    of the Catholic Church we have examples of communistic societies on a small
    scale. St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Thomas of Aquin and Fra Angelico, the
    illustrious orders of the Carmelites and Franciscans, the Jesuits, whose
    heroism carried the cross among the most savage tribes of American forests,
    the societies that wherever your communion is known have deemed no work of
    mercy too dangerous or too repellent &#8212; were or are communists. Knowing
    these things we cannot take it on ourselves to say that a social condition
    may not be possible in which an all-embracing love shall have taken the place
    of all other motives. But we see that communism is only possible where there
    exists a general and intense religious faith, and we see that such a state
    can be reached only through a state of justice. For before a man can be a
    saint he must first be an honest man.</p>
  <p><strong>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better
      term have come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ.
      We regard them
    as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social nature
    of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature. While we see that man
    is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or can come
    from the interference by the state with things that belong to individual
    action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him,
    a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social advance, having
    an indispensable place in the natural order. </strong>Looking on the bodily organism
    as the analogue of the social organism, and on the proper functions of the
    state as akin to those that in the human organism are discharged by the conscious
    intelligence, while the play of individual impulse and interest performs
    functions akin to those discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious
    instincts and involuntary motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who
    would try to get along without heads and the socialists like men who would
    try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of their
    frames by conscious will.</p>
  <p>The philosophical anarchists of whom I speak are few in number, and of little
    practical importance. It is with socialism in its various phases that we
    have to do battle.</p>
  <p>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize fully
    the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be held and
    governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
    knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
    the functions of the state.</p>
  <p>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees
                        is its want of radicalism, of going to the root. It takes
                      its theories
                            from those
                                  who have sought to justify the impoverishment
                    of the masses, and its advocates generally teach the preposterous
                      and
                        degrading
                            doctrine
                              that
                                slavery
                                  was
                                    the first condition of labor. It assumes
                    that
                      the tendency of wages to a minimum is the natural law,
                    and seeks
                        to abolish
                          wages;
                              it assumes
                                that
                                  the
                                    natural result of competition is to grind
                    down workers, and seeks
                                to abolish competition by restrictions, prohibitions
                        and extensions of governing
                                  power.
                                    Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly
                        blaming the stone for hitting it, it wastes strength
                    in striving for
                          remedies that
                              when
                                not worse
                                  are futile.
                                    Associated though it is in many places with
                    democratic aspiration, yet its essence is the same delusion
                    to which
                      the children of
                            Israel yielded
                                  when
                                    against the protest of their prophet they
                    insisted on a king; the delusion that has everywhere corrupted
                    democracies
                          and enthroned
                              tyrants &#8212; that
                                    power over the people can be used for the
                              benefit of the people; that there may be devised
                              machinery
                              that through
                              human
                              agencies will
                                secure
                                    for the
                                    management of individual affairs more wisdom
                              and more virtue than the people themselves possess.
                              This superficiality and this tendency may be seen
                              in all the phases of socialism. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IN socialism as distinguished from individualism there is an unquestionable
    truth &#8212; and that a truth to which (especially by those most identified
    with free-trade principles) too little attention has been paid. <strong>Man
    is primarily an individual &#8212; a separate entity, differing from his fellows in desires
    and powers, and requiring for the exercise of those powers and the gratification
    of those desires individual play and freedom. But he is also a social being,
    having desires that harmonize with those of his fellows, and powers that
    can only be brought out in concerted action.</strong> There is thus a domain of individual
    action and a domain of social action &#8212; some things which can best be
    done when each acts for himself, and some things which can best be done when
    society acts for all its members. And the natural tendency of advancing civilization
    is to make social conditions relatively more important, and more and more
    to enlarge the domain of social action. This has not been sufficiently regarded,
    and at the present time, evil unquestionably results from leaving to individual
    action functions that by reason of the growth of society and the developments
    of the arts have passed into the domain of <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> social
    action; just as, on the other hand, evil unquestionably results from social
    interference with what properly belongs to the individual. Society ought
    not to leave the telegraph and the railway to the management and control
    of individuals; nor yet ought society to step in and collect individual debts
    or attempt to direct individual industry. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free
