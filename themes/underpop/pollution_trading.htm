<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
    One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that
      nature can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private property
      rights. This line of thought is called free market environmentalism, and
      it&#8217;s favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute.</p>
  <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential paper
    by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960, Coase challenged
    the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation is the only way
    to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be protected through property
    rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined and the cost of enforcing
    them is low.</p>
  <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a polluter
    and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance, if the
    polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not to be emitted
    upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will come to a deal that
    reduces pollution.</p>
  <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
    air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid such
    potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a sum of money
    up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation for the inconvenience
    and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree on a level of pollution
    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given free
    to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of pollution
    is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking the opposite
    tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
    Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common property
    and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</p>
  <p>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property rights
    when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by everyone? It turns out
    this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s no
    textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
    I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
    Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
    In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
    different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new property
    rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a long time, it
    behooves us to get them right.</p>
  <p>Consider the matter of who represents pollutees. Coase presented his model
    in its simplest form: a single polluter and a single pollutee. In the real
    world, there are usually a few large polluters and millions of people who
    are polluted upon. It&#8217;s prohibitively expensive for individual pollutees
    to sue large polluters, just as it is for large polluters to negotiate individually
    with pollutees.</p>
  <p>For the Coasian model to work, the class of pollutees as a whole needs to
    be represented by an agent. What&#8217;s more, it matters to whom that agent
    is accountable, and what principles drive its actions. If either the accountability
    or the principles are wrong, the agent will sooner or later do the wrong
    things. But if the agent&#8217;s accountability and principles are right,
    we may actually have a fix for capitalism&#8217;s predisposition to pollute.
    The key is to make each agent a trustee for future generations and all living
    citizens equally.</p>
  <p>Then there&#8217;s the matter of who gets the initial property rights, and
    whether or not they have to pay for them. Consider <strong>pollution trading </strong>as it&#8217;s
    been put into practice so far. <strong>Government issues permits to dump
    a particular pollutant into the commons. It gives the permits &#8212; for free &#8212; to
    large polluters, based on how much they polluted in the past. Past polluters
    who reduce their future pollution can benefit by selling permits they no
    longer need.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>This kind of pollution trading involves both propertization and
      privatization. First, a new kind of property is created &#8212; a right
      to emit a particular chemical into the commons. Then, this piece of property
      is given to private
    corporations. I have no problem with the first part of this process, propertization.
    What troubles me is the second part, privatization.</strong></p>
  <p>Giving away pollution permits, instead of auctioning them to the highest
            bidders, is like handing out free leases to an office building. Worse,
          it&#8217;s
            like handing out free leases and letting the freeloaders sublease
          to others and pinch the rent. And we&#8217;re not talking about pocket
          change, either. When it comes to carbon dioxide emissions, the assignment
          of property rights
            is potentially worth trillions of dollars. That&#8217;s money consumers
            will inescapably pay in higher prices for energy. To whom they pay
            it depends
            on who gets the property rights to the sky. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
