<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: In Globalization and its Discontents, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
  the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. <strong>But
    the land is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to
    pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society.</strong> So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>
