<p align="center"><strong>Is There a Right to Employment?
</strong></p>
<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry
George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOW, why is it that men, have to work for such low wages? Because, if they
    were to demand higher wages, there are plenty of unemployed men ready to
    step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed men who compel that
    fierce competition that drives wages down to the point of bare subsistence.
    Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment? Did you ever think
    what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment?&nbsp; If men
    cannot find an employer, why can they not employ themselves? Simply because
    they are shut out from the element on which human labor can alone be exerted;
    men are compelled to compete with each other for the wages of an employer,
    because they have been robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves;
    because they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
    paying some other human creature for the privilege. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The
    Crime of Poverty</a> <br>
            <br>
WE laud as public benefactors those who, as we say, "furnish employment." We
are constantly talking as though this "furnishing of employment," this "giving
of work" were the greatest boon that could be conferred upon society. To listen
to much that is talked and much that is written, one would think that the cause
of poverty is that there is not work enough for so many people, and that if the
Creator had made the rock harder, the soil less fertile, iron as scarce as gold,
and gold as diamonds; or if ships would sink and cities burn down oftener, there
would be less poverty, because there would be more work to do. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp08.html">Social
Problems,</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp08.html"> Chapter
8 &#8212; That We All Might Be Rich</a><br>
            <br>
YOU assert the right of laborers to employment and their right to receive from
their employers a certain indefinite wage. No such rights exist. No one has a
right to demand employment of another, or to demand higher wages than the other
is willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another to make him raise
such wages against his will. There can be no better moral justification for such
demands on employers by working-men than there would be for employers demanding
that working-men shall be compelled to work for them when they do not want to,
and to accept wages lower than they are willing to take. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
THE natural right which each man has, is not that of demanding employment or
wages from another man, but that of employing himself &#8212; that of applying
by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which the Creator has in the
land provided for all men. Were that storehouse open, as by the single tax we
would open it, the natural demand for labor would keep pace with the supply,
the man who sold labor and the man who bought it would become free exchangers
for mutual advantage, and all cause for dispute between workman and employer
would be gone. For then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity
to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for another
for less, all things considered, than he could earn by working for himself, wages
would necessarily rise to their full value, and the relations of workman and
employer be regulated by mutual interest and convenience. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q26. Hasn't every man who needs it a right to be employed by the government?</em><br />
    A. No. But he has a right to have government secure him in the enjoyment
      of his equal right to the opportunities for employment that nature and
      social growth supply. When government secures him in that respect, if he
      cannot get work it is because (1) he does not offer the kind of service
      that people want; or (2) he is incapable. His remedy, if he does not offer
      the kind of service that people want, is either to make people see that
      they are mistaken, or go to work at something else; if he is incapable,
      his remedy is to improve himself. In no case has he a right to government
      interference in his behalf, either through schemes to make work, or by
  bounties or tariffs. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What Is Geolibertarianism?</strong></p>
  <p> Geolibertarians are simply libertarians who take the principle of self-ownership
    to its logical conclusion: J<strong>ust as the right to one's self implies
    the right to the fruit of one's labor (i.e., the right to property), the
    right to the
    fruit of one's labor implies the right to labor, and the right to labor implies
    the right to labor &#8212; somewhere. </strong>Hence <a href="http://www.jim.com/2ndtreat.htm#5CHAP">John
    Locke's proviso</a> that one has &quot;property&quot; in land only to the
    extent that there is &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; When
    there is not, land begins to have <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/rent1.htm">rental </a>value.
    Thus, the rental value of land reflects the extent to which Locke's proviso
    has been violated, thereby making community-collection of rent, or CCR, a
    just and necessary means of upholding the Lockean principle of private property.
    In the late 19th century CCR was known as the &quot;Single Tax&quot;&#8212; a
    term that was (and is) used to denote <a href="http://www.progress.org/books/george.htm">Henry
    George's</a> proposal to abolish all taxes save for a single &quot;tax&quot; on
    the value of land, irrespective of the value of improvements in or on it. </p>
