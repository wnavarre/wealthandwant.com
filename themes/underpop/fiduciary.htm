<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So too in a market economy. When two property rights come to the same intersection,
    one has to trump the other. Either capital can fire labor, or labor can fire
    capital. Either my right to pollute trumps your right not to be polluted,
    or vice versa. As they say in Hollywood, someone must get top billing.</p>
  <p>But who? Marjorie Kelly has written a brilliant book called The Divine Right
    of Capital. By divine she doesn&#8217;t mean God-given. She means that, under
    our current operating system, the rights of capital trump everything else.
    The rights of workers, communities, nature, and future generations &#8212; all
    play second fiddle to capital&#8217;s prerogative to maximize short-term
    gain. This hierarchy isn&#8217;t the doing of God or some inexorable law
    of nature. Rather, it&#8217;s a result of political choice.</p>
  <p>The question of who gets the top right in any society is always an interesting
    one. Invariably, the top dogs in any era assert that there&#8217;s no alternative.
    Kings said it three hundred years ago; capital owners say it today. They
    hire priests and economists to add moral or pseudoscientific credence to
    their claims. The truth, though, is that societies choose their top right
    holders, and we can change our minds if we wish.</p>
  <p>Kelly locates many places where capital&#8217;s supremacy is written into
    our codes. Corporate directors, for example, are bound by law to put shareholders&#8217; financial
    gain first. If a raider offers a higher price for a publicly traded company
    than its current market value, directors have little choice but to sell,
    regardless of the consequences for workers, communities, or nature. Similarly,
    it&#8217;s the fiduciary duty of mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional
    investors to seek the highest returns for their shareholders or beneficiaries.
    This duty is embodied, among other places, in the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974. Although the language of the act sounds innocent enough &#8212; a
    pension fund manager, like any trustee, &#8220;shall discharge his duties
    . . . solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries&#8221; &#8212; it
    results, ironically, in the financing of many workers&#8217; retirements
    by investing in companies that shift other workers&#8217; jobs overseas.
    Throw in the WTO and NAFTA, and the rights of capital stand comfortably astride
    everyone else&#8217;s. ...</p>
  <p>Trusts are centuries-old institutions devised to hold and manage property
    for beneficiaries. The essence of a trust is a fiduciary relationship. Neither
    trusts nor their trustees may ever act in their own self-interest; they&#8217;re
    legally obligated to act solely on behalf of beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Trusts are bound by numerous rules, including the following:</p>
  <p> * Managers must act with undivided loyalty to beneficiaries.<br>
  * Unless authorized to act otherwise, managers must preserve the corpus of
    the trust. It&#8217;s okay to spend income, but not to diminish principal.<br>
  * Managers must ensure transparency by making timely financial information
  available to beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>These rules are enforceable. The basic enforcement mechanism is that an
    aggrieved beneficiary or a state attorney general can bring suit against
    a trustee. When that happens, the trustee must prove she acted prudently;
    if there&#8217;s any doubt, the trustee is fined or fired. As Supreme Court
    Justice Benjamin Cardozo once put it: &#8220;A trustee is held to something
    stricter than the morals of the marketplace. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio
    of an honor the most sensitive, is the standard of behavior.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A trustee isn&#8217;t the same thing as a steward. Stewards care for an
    asset, but their obligations are voluntary and vague. By contrast, trustees&#8217; obligations
    are mandatory and quite specific. Trusteeship is thus a more formal and rigorous
    responsibility than stewardship.</p>
  <p>Trusts can be in charge of financial as well as physical assets. In this
    chapter, my concern is natural assets &#8212; gifts we inherit from creation.
    One of my premises is that each generation has a contract to pass on such
    gifts, undiminished, to those not yet born. If we are to keep this contract,
    someone must act as trustee of nature&#8217;s gifts, or at least of the most
    endangered of them. The question is, who?</p>
  <p>The candidates are government, corporations, and trusts. I argued earlier
    that neither corporations nor government can fulfill this function; they&#8217;re
    both too bound to short-term private interests. That leaves trusts. ...</p>
  <p>Think, for example, about carbon. At present, our economic engine is emitting
    far too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; this is destabilizing the
    climate. We desperately need a valve that can crank the carbon flow down.
    Let&#8217;s assume we can design and install such a valve. (I explained how
    this can be done in my previous book, Who Owns the Sky? It involves selling
    a limited quantity of &#8220;upstream&#8221; permits to companies that bring
    fossil fuels into the economy.) The question then is, who should control
    the valve?</p>
  <p>Unfettered markets can&#8217;t be given that responsibility; as we&#8217;ve
    seen, they have no ability to limit polluting. So we&#8217;re left with two
    options: government or trusts. Government is a political creature; its time
    horizon is short, and future generations have no clout in it. Common property
    trusts, by contrast, are fiduciary institutions. They have long time horizons
    and a legal responsibility to future generations. Given the choice, I&#8217;d
    designate a common property trust to be keeper of the carbon valve, based
    on peer-reviewed advice from scientists. Its trustees could make hard decisions
    without committing political suicide. They might be appointed by the president,
    like governors of the Fed, but they wouldn&#8217;t be obedient to him the
    way cabinet members are. Once appointed, they&#8217;d be legally accountable
    to future generations.</p>
  <p>Now imagine a goodly number of valves at the local, regional, and national
    levels, not just for carbon (which requires only one national valve) but
    for a variety of pollutants. Imagine also that the valve keepers are trusts
    accountable to future generations. They&#8217;d have the power to reduce
    some of the negative externalities &#8212; the illth &#8212; that corporations
    shift to the commons. They&#8217;d also have the power to auction limited
    pollution rights to the highest bidders, and to divide the resulting income
    among commons owners. That&#8217;s something neither the Fed nor the EPA
    can do.</p>
  <p>These trusts would fundamentally change our economic operating system. What
    are now unpriced externalities would become property rights under accountable
    management. If a corporation wanted to pollute, it couldn&#8217;t just do
    so; it would have to buy the rights from a commons trust. The price of pollution
    would go up; corporate illth creation would go down. Ecosystems would be
    protected for future generations. More income would flow to ordinary citizens.
    Nonhuman species would flourish; human inequality would diminish. And government
    wouldn&#8217;t be enlarged &#8212; our economic engine would do these things
    on its own.</p>
  <p>One final point about valves. It&#8217;s not too critical where we set them
    initially. It&#8217;s far more important to install them in the right places,
    and to put the right people in charge. Then they can adjust the settings.
    ...</p>
  <p>Accountability and Democracy</p>
  <p>The question I&#8217;m most often asked about commons trusteeship is: How
    can we be sure trustees won&#8217;t succumb to corporate influence, just
    as politicians have? My answer is that, while there can be no guarantees,
    the odds of escaping corporate capture are much better with trustees than
    with elected officials.</p>
  <p>The key reason is accountability. In the world of corporations, accountability
    is quite clear: directors must be loyal to shareholders. In the world of
    government, accountability is less clear. Elected officials must uphold the
    Constitution, but that&#8217;s about it. If there are conflicts between workers
    and employers, polluters and pollutees, voters and donors, or future generations
    and current ones, whose side should politicians be on? There are no requirements
    or even guidelines. Elected officials, as sovereign political actors, are
    free to do as they please.</p>
  <p>The fact that politicians operate this way is no accident; it&#8217;s what
    the Founders had in mind. The job of democratic government isn&#8217;t to
    take, consistently, one side or another. Rather, it&#8217;s to resolve disputes
    among factions peaceably, without trampling minorities. James Madison made
    this plain in the Federalist Papers. Voters can &#8220;fire&#8221; elected
    officials at regular intervals if a majority so chooses, but they can&#8217;t
    expect loyalty to any particular constituency between elections. It&#8217;s
    this absence of built-in loyalty that opens the door to corporate influence,
    a force the Founders didn&#8217;t &#8212; and couldn&#8217;t &#8212; foresee.</p>
  <p>The decision-making of judges, it should be noted, isn&#8217;t as untethered
    as that of legislators and executive officeholders. Their duty is to uphold
    not just the skeletal bones of the Constitution but the full flesh and blood
    of the law, with its thousands of pages and interpretations. They may, on
    occasion, interpret anew, but unless they&#8217;re among a Supreme Court
    majority, all such reinterpretations are subject to review.</p>
  <p>Trustees are in the same boat as judges, rather than the wide-open waters
    in which politicians swim. Their hands are constrained both by the law and
    by their fiduciary duty to beneficiaries. This isn&#8217;t to say they have
    no room to wiggle: equally loyal trustees may differ over what&#8217;s in
    the best interest of beneficiaries. Still, they are subject to court review,
    and they can&#8217;t betray their beneficiaries too brazenly.</p>
  <p>The tricky thing here is that the beneficiaries to whom we want commons
    trustees to be loyal &#8212; future generations, nonhumans, and ecosystems &#8212; are
    voiceless and powerless. We must therefore take extra care when we set up
    commons trusts. For example, we should install strict conflict-of-interest
    rules for trustees and managers. We should require that all relevant information
    about the trusts &#8212; including audited financial reports &#8212; are
    freely available on the Internet. We should ensure that, if a commons trust
    fails, its assets are transferred to a similar trust rather than privatized.
    We should build in internal watchdogs and ombudsmen. And we should authorize
    external advocates, such as nonprofit organizations, to represent nonliving
    beneficiaries who, by their very nature, can&#8217;t take trustees to court.
    Most states assign this function to their attorneys general, but this is
    insufficient given the political pressures attorneys general are subject
    to.</p>
  <p>With regard to the manner of selecting trustees, there&#8217;s no single
    method. Trustees might be elected, appointed by outsiders, or be self-perpetuating
    like the boards of many nonprofits. This is as it should be; we don&#8217;t
    live in a one-size-fits-all world. The important thing is that, once selected,
    trustees should have secure tenure, and &#8212; like judges &#8212; lengthy
    terms. Indeed, trustees should be like judges in other ways: professional,
    impeccably honest, well-compensated, and honored. Being a commons trustee
    should be a distinguished and attractive calling.</p>
  <p>It might be argued that, by shielding trustees from direct political influence,
    we&#8217;d make them &#8212; and commons trusts generally &#8212; undemocratic.
    The same could be said, however, for our courts. The fact is, there are certain
    decisions, both economic and judicial, that should be shielded from politics
    and markets. Moreover, neither government nor corporations represent the
    needs of future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species. Commons trusts
    can do this. In that sense, they&#8217;d expand rather than constrict the
    boundaries of democracy. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
