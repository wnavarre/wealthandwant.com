Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  We hold: That&#8212;</p>
  <p>This world is the creation of God.</p>
  <p>The men brought into it for the brief period of their earthly lives are
    the equal creatures of his bounty, the equal subjects of his provident care.</p>
  <p>By his constitution man is beset by physical wants, on the satisfaction
    of which depend not only the maintenance of his physical life but also the
    development of his intellectual and spiritual life.</p>
  <p>God has made the satisfaction of these wants dependent on man&#8217;s own
    exertions, giving him the power and laying on him the injunction to labor &#8212; a
    power that of itself raises him far above the brute, since we may reverently
    say that it enables him to become as it were a helper in the creative work.</p>
  <p>God has not put on man the task of making bricks without straw. With the
    need for labor and the power to labor he has also given to man the material
    for labor. This material is land &#8212; man physically being a land animal,
    who can live only on and from land, and can use other elements, such as air,
    sunshine and water, only by the use of land.</p>
  <p>Being the equal creatures of the Creator, equally entitled under his providence
    to live their lives and satisfy their needs, men are equally entitled to
    the use of land, and any adjustment that denies this equal use of land is
    morally wrong. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><br>
    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>      <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
      reason.</strong> (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
    new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
    never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
    the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the <a href="../../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Bishop
    of Meath</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit
      filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Your Holiness seems to assume that there is some just rate of wages that
    employers ought to be willing to pay and that laborers should be content
    to receive, and to imagine that if this were secured there would be an end
    of strife. This rate you evidently think of as that which will give working-men
    a frugal living, and perhaps enable them by hard work and strict economy
    to lay by a little something.</p>
  <p>But how can a just rate of wages be fixed without the &#8220;higgling of
    the market&#8221; any more than the just price of corn or pigs or ships or
    paintings can be so fixed? And would not arbitrary regulation in the one
    case as in the other check that interplay that most effectively promotes
    the economical adjustment of productive forces? Why should buyers of labor,
    any more than buyers of commodities, be called on to pay higher prices than
    in a free market they are compelled to pay? Why should the sellers of labor
    be content with anything less than in a free market they can obtain? Why
    should working-men be content with frugal fare when the world is so rich?
    Why should they be satisfied with a lifetime of toil and stinting, when the
    world is so beautiful? Why should not they also desire to gratify the higher
    instincts, the finer tastes? Why should they be forever content to travel
    in the steerage when others find the cabin more enjoyable?</p>
  <p>Nor will they. The ferment of our time does not arise merely from the fact
    that working-men find it harder to live on the same scale of comfort. It
    is also and perhaps still more largely due to the increase of their desires
    with an improved scale of comfort. This increase of desire must continue.
    <strong>For working-men are men. And man is the unsatisfied animal.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>He is not an ox, of whom it may be said, so much grass, so much grain, so
    much water, and a little salt, and he will be content. On the contrary, the
    more he gets the more he craves. When he has enough food then he wants better
    food. When he gets a shelter then he wants a more commodious and tasty one.
    When his animal needs are satisfied then mental and spiritual desires arise.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>This restless discontent is of the nature of man &#8212; of that
      nobler nature that raises him above the animals by so immeasurable a gulf,
      and shows
    him to be indeed created in the likeness of God.</strong> It is not to be
    quarreled with, for it is the motor of all progress. It is this that has
    raised St.
    Peter&#8217;s dome and on dull, dead canvas made the angelic face of the
    Madonna to glow; it is this that has weighed suns and analyzed stars, and
    opened page after page of the wonderful works of creative intelligence; it
    is this that has narrowed the Atlantic to an ocean ferry and trained the
    lightning to carry our messages to the remotest lands; it is this that is
    opening to us possibilities beside which all that our modern civilization
    has as yet accomplished seem small. Nor can it be repressed save by degrading
    and embruting men; by reducing Europe to Asia. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with
    links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    DOES not the fact that all of the things which furnish man's subsistence
      have the power to multiply many fold &#8212; some of them many thousand
      fold, and some of them many million or even billion fold &#8212; while
      he is only doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings increase to
      the full extent of their reproductive power, the increase of population
      can never exceed subsistence? This is clear when it is remembered that
      though in the vegetable and animal kingdoms each species, by virtue of
      its reproductive power, naturally and necessarily presses against the conditions
      which limit its further increase, yet these conditions are nowhere fixed
      and final. No species reaches the ultimate limit of soil, water, air, and
      sunshine; but the actual limit of each is in the existence of other species,
      its rivals, its enemies, or its food. Thus the conditions which limit the
      existence of such of these species as afford him subsistence man can extend
      (in some cases his mere appearance will extend them), and thus the reproductive
      forces of the species which supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves
      against their former limit, start forward in his service at a pace which
      his powers of increase cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds
      will increase: if he but trap foxes the wild rabbits will multiply; the
      bumble bee moves with the pioneer, and on the organic matter with which
      man's presence fills the rivers, fishes feed. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
      II, Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North American
    continent, there would now be no more bears than in the time of Columbus,
    and possibly fewer, for bear food would not have been increased nor the conditions
    of bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the reverse.
    But within the limits of the United States alone, there are now forty-five
    millions of men where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet
    there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five
    millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. It is not the
    increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of
    men that has brought about the increase of food. There is more food, simply
    because there are more Man. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
    Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>TWENTY men working together will, where nature is niggardly, produce more
    than twenty times the wealth that one man can produce where nature is most
    bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the subdivision
    of labor, the greater the economies of production and distribution, and,
    hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the
    limits in which we have any reason to suppose increase would still go on,
    in any given state of civilization a greater number of people can produce
    a larger proportionate amount of wealth and more fully supply their wants,
    than can a smaller number. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
    Chapter 4: Population and Subsistence: Disproof of the Malthusian Theory </p>
  <p>OUT upon nature, in upon him himself, back through the mists that shroud
    the past, forward into the darkness that overhangs the future, turns the
    restless desire that arises when the animal wants slumber in satisfaction.
    Beneath things he seeks the law; he would know how the globe was forged,
    and the stars were hung, and trace to their sources the springs of life.
    And then, as the man develops his nobler nature, there arises the desire
    higher yet &#8212; the passion of passions, the hope of hopes &#8212; the
    desire that he, even he, may somehow aid in making life better and brighter,
    in destroying want and sin, sorrow and shame. He masters and curbs the animal;
    he turns his back upon the feast and renounces the place of power; he leaves
    it to others to accumulate wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves
    in the warm sunshine of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and
    never can see; for a fame, or it may be but for a scant justice, that can
    only come long after the clods have rattled upon his coffin lid. He toils
    in the advance, where it is cold, and there is little cheer from men, and
    the stones are sharp and the brambles thick.</p>
  <p>Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that stab like knives, he
    builds for the future; he cuts the trail that progressive humanity may hereafter
    broaden into a highroad. Into higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons,
    and a star that rises in the east leads him on. Lo! the pulses of the man
    throb with the yearnings of the god &#8212; he would aid in the process of
    the suns! &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II, Chapter 3, Population
