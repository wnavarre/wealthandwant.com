<p>Bill Batt: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../docs/Batt_3legged.html">The
Fallacy of the "Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tax experts, especially at the state level, ply their trade by invoking one
      metaphor above all others: the three-legged
    stool.<small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><font size="-1">1</font></span></small>&nbsp; It
    rests on the claim that a sound and successful tax regime for any government
    needs
    to rely on a three tax bases: income, property and sales.&nbsp; This is repeated
    so often that it passes today without much examination.</p>
  <p>There seem to be three arguments for this: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>that taxes should be drawn from as wide an array of sources as possible
          so as not to overburden any one base or sector.</li>
    <li>that the spread of tax burdens over a number of bases will ensure greater
          stability and reliability.</li>
    <li>that reliance upon a wider number of revenue streams minimizes the downside
          consequences which all taxes impose on the economy. ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_3legged.html">read the whole article</a></li>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But it is probable that the disposition to tax everything susceptible of
    taxation does not spring so much from the notion that more may thus be obtained,
    as from the notion that as a matter of justice everything should be taxed.
    That all species of property shall be equally taxed, is enjoined by many
    of our State constitutions, and that it should be so, at least so far as
    direct taxation is concerned, is regarded by most of our people as a self-evident
    truth &#8212; the idea being that every one should contribute to public expenses
    in proportion to his means, or, as it is sometimes phrased, that all property,
    being equally protected by the State, should equally contribute to the expenses
    of the State.</p>
  <p>But under no system that any of our legislatures have yet been able to devise
    is all property equally taxed; nor can it be equally taxed. And if it were
    possible to even approximate to the equal taxation of all property, this
    would not be to secure that equality which justice demands. For, as is evident
    in the case of mortgages, etc., to equally tax all property would infallibly
    be to levy a higher rate of taxation upon some than upon others; and even
    if the same proportion could be taken from the means of every member of the
    community, that would no more conform to the dictates of equality than would
    the levy upon each of an equal sum; for, as the demand for a sum which would
    not be felt by the rich man would fall with crushing weight on the poor man,
    so to take the same proportion of their means would be a very different thing
    to him who has barely enough, and to him who has a large surplus.</p>
  <p>Quite as fallacious is the idea that all property should be equally taxed,
    because equally protected. The fact is that all property is not equally protected,
    cannot be equally protected, and ought not to be equally protected, if by
    protection anything more is meant than the mere preservation of the peace.
    The protection of property is not the end, it is only one of the incidents,
    of government. As John Stuart Mill says: &quot;The ends of government are
    as comprehensive as those of the social union. They consist of all the good
    and all the immunity from evil which the existence of government can be made,
    either directly or indirectly, to bestow.&quot; And to say that government
    should impartially protect and equally tax all property, is like saying that
    the farmer should bestow the same care upon everything he may find growing
    in his fields, whether weeds or grain.</p>
  <p>That there is no obligation to equally tax all property is fully realized
    in regard to property brought from abroad. No one contends for a tariff which
    should equally tax all such property. The protectionists assert that the
    leading idea in determining what should be taxed and what not taxed, and
    the different rates which various imports should bear, ought to be the promotion
    of the general good by the encouragement and protection of industry. Their
    opponents, on the other hand, do not deny the propriety of such exemptions
    and discriminations. They merely deny that industry can be protected and
    encouraged by the endeavor to shield certain classes of producers from foreign
    competition; and, in the enactment of a purely revenue tariff, they would
    make the same kind of exemptions and discriminations, with a view to the
    collection of the revenue with the smallest cost and least interference with
    trade. Both parties equally recognize the general good as the true guiding
    principle in taxation of this kind.</p>
  <p>Even in internal taxation the same principle is largely recognized. On certain
    businesses and certain manufactures we impose taxes not imposed upon others,
    on the ground that it is for the public good that such businesses and manufactures
    should be restricted. With similar regard to the public good, we exempt certain
    species of property from taxation, as cotton factories in Georgia, growing
    crops in California, property devoted to religious and charitable uses in
    New York, the bonds of the United States, by Federal law, etc.</p>
  <p>Evidently this regard for the general good is the true principle of taxation.
    The more it is examined the more clearly it will be seen that there is no
    valid reason why we should, in any case, attempt to tax all property. That
    equality should be the rule and aim of taxation is true, and this for the
    reason given in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created
    equal. But equality does not require that all men should be taxed alike,
    or that all things should be taxed alike. It merely requires that whatever
    taxes are imposed shall be equally imposed upon the persons or things in
    like conditions or situations; it merely requires that no citizen shall be
    given an advantage, or put at a disadvantage, as compared with other citizens.</p>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
