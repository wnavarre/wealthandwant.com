<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond t<strong>he
      mere selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their
      goods
    are worth,</strong> springs from such superficial ideas as that production,
    not consumption, is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods
    involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers, enters
    into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate of profit upon
    that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the
    manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price
    and are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the tax with
    all intermediate profits upon it, together with their :usual rate of profit
    upon the whole, from final purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what
    appears on the surface to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination
    to be an indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of
    profits upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were imposed
    upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount of the
    tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect
    the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
    and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with their profit
    from retailers, who would collect with their profit from shoe consumers.
    The principle applies also when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales
    of merchants, or the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with
    the usual profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
    interest and discounts.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
      or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost wholesalers
      $110,000;
    at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
    and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
    of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would get.
    Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that indirect
    taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed only
    upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed upon materials
    also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent in addition
    to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect
      taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe
      manufacturers,
    or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest,
    it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is because
    the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other
    tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
    goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business. It
    follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase the price
    of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must
    pay as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the cost
    of their output as is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of
    the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase
    the price of their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as
    the tax is more or less great and competition more or less keen. ...<br>

  <p><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; <strong>so as to take from the people
      as little as possible in addition to what it yields the government</strong>. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; s<strong>o as to give no citizen an advantage
        or put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others</strong>. 23 ...</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p><strong>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers
      through many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until
      they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.</strong>26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and
        in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as
        they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been often attempted,
        the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and the borrower must pay
        it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses it in his business, he in
        his turn must get back the tax from his customers, or his business becomes
        unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
        finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until building rents
        become high enough to pay the regular profit and the tax besides. If we impose
        a tax upon manufactures or imported goods, the manufacturer or importer will
        charge it in a higher price to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and
        the retailer to the consumer. Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately
        falls, must not only pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this
        amount to everyone who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit
        on the capital he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. 2.</font><br>
