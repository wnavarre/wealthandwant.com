    Conflict Between Protecting Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Three hundred years ago virtually no one questioned the propriety of slavery.
    Even John Locke, that most articulate advocate of human freedom, invested in
    slaves. But over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, amid
    extreme controversy in some times and places, slavery was nearly eliminated
    from the world. With a bit of a lag, a consensus gradually evolved among humanity
    that slavery was wrong, indeed that no distinctions in civil rights based on
    race
  could be justified. </p>
  <p>Two hundred years ago almost no one thought that women should be allowed to
    vote. Amid extreme controversy in some times and places, they were granted
    voting rights. Now virtually no one argues that women should be denied any
    rights that men have. We have not yet arrived at a consensus about what equality
    of the sexes means, but we are near a consensus that we should strive for it.</p>
  <p>The next point to be made is that it would not be reasonable to expect constitutional
    changes that reflect new moral understandings to be made as approximate Pareto
    improvements. It would have been possible to end slavery in a way that made
    almost no one noticeably worse off as compared to their expected utilities
    under slavery. It would merely have been necessary to declare the slaves free,
    provided that they made reasonable progress on paying debts to their former
    masters equal to their market value as slaves, and that they used their first
    earnings to buy insurance policies that would compensate their former masters
    in the event that they died or became incapacitated before they finished paying
    the debts. But such an end to slavery would never have satisfied the impulse
    that pushed for its abolition.</p>
  <p>Ending slavery was not an issue of economic efficiency or voter preferences.
    Slavery needed to be ended because so many people could not in good conscience
    participate in a legal system that enforced slavery. If slavery was wrong,
    there was no basis for requiring persons subjected to slavery to purchase their
    freedom. They had to be recognized as unconditionally free. Others would need
    to bear the loss from the fact that those formerly recognized as the owners
    of slaves would no longer be allowed to appropriate the product of slave labor.
    Who should bear the loss?</p>
  <p><b>Assigning the
    Costs of Moral Accidents</b></p>
  <p>In addressing this question, it is helpful to employ ideas from the theory
    of accidents. We now see that the perpetuation of slavery was a moral accident.
    To reduce the likelihood of future moral accidents, it is sensible to assign
    the costs of accidents to some or all of the persons who could have prevented
    them. Costs might also reasonably be assigned to anyone who benefitted from
    the accidents. Among the prominent candidates for bearing the cost would be
    those who captured people and sold them into slavery, those who bought, sold
    and transported slaves, those who held slaves, those who passed and enforced
    laws perpetuating slavery, those who bought products produced with slave labor,
    those who sold goods to persons involved in the selling or holding of slaves,
    etc. Anyone who received an inheritance derived from slavery could be called
    upon to relinquish it as well. Emphatically not on the list are the slaves
    themselves and any person who came of age without an inheritance after slavery
    ended. They did not cause slavery. Thus it was wrong of Britain, in ending
    slavery in the 1830s, to compensate those who were historically regarded as
    the owners of slaves with funds from general revenues, and with a rule permitting
    them to work the slaves for a few more years, during which many slaves were
    worked to death.</p>
  <p>There are particular advantages to assigning the cost of the end of slavery
    to those who thought of themselves as slave owners. It is administratively
    more efficient than other possibilities, because in means leaving the costs
    where they fall. More importantly, the idea that slavery might be seen to be
    wrong, and that then the costs of ending slavery might be left where the fall,
    provides a continuing incentive for those involved in slavery to cease. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">read
