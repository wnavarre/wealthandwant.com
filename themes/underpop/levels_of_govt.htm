<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From 1778 to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, the United States
    was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Article VII stated the expenses
  of the Confederation shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall
    be supplied by the several states, in proportion to the value of all land within
    each state, granted
    to or surveyed for any person, as such land and the buildings and improvements
    thereon shall be estimated according to such mode as the United States in Congress
    assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint. The taxes for paying
    that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of
    the legislatures of the several states within the time agreed upon by the United
  States in Congress assembled.17</p>
  <p>Thus, the states would levy taxes and each would pass on a share of the federal
    budget based on its land value. Individuals would pay taxes only to their state
    and local governments.18<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation would provide
    about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local government revenue,
    which would be more than adequate for government spending if it did not include
    transfer payments. The taxable value of the land in the economy would increase
  over time for two reasons.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, a shift from taxing production to taxing land values would eliminate
              the lost output due to taxes &#8212; about $1 trillion per year.44
              One-fifth of that would be rent, thus increasing rent by $300 billion.</li>
    <li> Secondly, the economy would grow faster, which also would increase rent
    over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a concrete example, the transition to land value taxation can be accomplished
    in these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Each county expands its register of all real estate and the title holders
                to include all lands owned by governments and previously non-registered
        entities.</li>
    <li> Local real estate taxes are split into two taxes, one on land value
        and one on improvements.</li>
    <li> The county real estate assessment function is transferred to land
                    value assessment boards, comprised of representatives from
      the federal, state, county,
                    and municipal governments as well as real estate professionals
              and scholars. These boards appoint assessors and establish an appeals
                    process, similar to
        current real estate tax appeals.</li>
    <li> All land is assessed at its current market value.</li>
    <li> Over a period of years, depending on how much land values already
                        have fallen in anticipation of the tax shift, the tax
      on improvements is reduced, while
                        the tax on land values is increased. (An immediate tax
      shift to geo-rent, with other taxes reduced or abolished, could be compensated,
                        for
                        those with net
                        losses, with special bonds whose face-value interest
      payments
              would
                        decrease over time; this would have an effect similar
      to the gradual increase in the
        geo-rent tax rate.)</li>
    <li> Sales taxes, tariffs, and excise taxes are reduced and eventually
        eliminated.</li>
    <li>The personal exemption in federal income taxes is raised
                            each year, until it eventually includes all income,
      at which time
                            all state and federal personal
                            income taxes are abolished. The taxation of corporate
      profits is also phased out.</li>
    <li> The value of material land (minerals, oil, water, etc.),
                              the electromagnetic spectrum, naturally growing
      forests, and other
                              natural resources
                              is taxed at gradually increasing rates up to a
      substantial amount, if not all, of the unimproved
        rental value.</li>
    <li> An amendment to the Constitution is enacted prohibiting
                                any taxation of wages, sales, profits, value-added,
              or produced wealth
                                and establishing
                                the
                                taxation of the value of land and other natural
      resources, along with voluntary user fees and charges for pollution
                                and congestion,
                                as the only sources of
                                public revenues. The amendment also establishes
      a land value tax commission with representatives from the
              federal, state,
                                local,
                                territorial, and Indian-nation
                                governments to divide the taxes raised. Generally,
              taxes raised from off-shore oil and water, atmospheric pollution,
                                airline
                                routes, and
                                other continental
                                uses would be allocated to the federal government,
              and the rest would be allocated to the state (or provincial,
                                in Canada),
                                local,
                                territorial,
                                and Indian-nation
                                governments. If the national government needs
      additional revenue, it is obtained from the state or territorial
                                governments in
                                proportion to their land value,
                                as was specified in the Articles of Confederation
      that preceded the U.S. Constitution.</li>
    <li> Top-down revenue sharing from federal to state
                                  and from state to local government stops. Many
      services, functions, and agencies
                                  are transferred from
                                  the central government to the state/provincial
      and local
                                  governments. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font><br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Land Value Taxation and Decentralized Governance</p>
  <p>The United States is a federation of states (and Indian-nation reservations),
    with many government functions such as criminal law, education, and local services
    provided by the states. Since the federal income tax was enacted in 1913, taxation
    and authority have shifted increasingly to the federal government.</p>
  <p>In 1902, federal taxes represented 37 percent of total revenue to governments
      at all levels.45 By 2002, federal taxes represented 67 percent of the government
      revenue pie.46 The share taken by state governments rose from 11.4 percent
      in 1902 to 21.5 percent in 1986. Local governments&#8217; share fell from
      51.3 percent in 1902 to 13.7 percent in 1986.</p>
  <p>The change in the share of tax revenues taken by each level of government
      has occurred in large part because of the relative ease of increasing income
      taxes at the federal level, and the relative difficulty of increasing local
      and state taxes. Taxpayers find it much easier to respond to changes in
    state and local taxes, by moving to lower-tax communities. It is far more
    difficult
      to avoid taxes imposed by the federal government &#8212; especially since
      U.S. citizens are taxed even if they are abroad.</p>
  <p>Revenue-sharing from the federal government to the states is, in effect, a
    tax cartel among the states, collusion to tax the population and then divide
    the funds among the states. Taxation at the federal level also encourages spending
    by the federal government instead of the states, so now we have federal departments
    and agencies for education, housing, health and welfare, energy, and other
    fields that once were local, state, or private-sector matters.</p>
  <p>Local and state governments, once willing to go along with the federal government&#8217;s
      tax-and-revenue-sharing scheme, are beginning to realize centralized taxing
      brings with it centralized authority, dramatically reducing local control.
      Revenue-sharing comes with strings attached: Local and state governments
    must abide by federal government mandates in order to obtain the funds, taken
    from
      their residents in the first place. Revenue-sharing allows the federal
    government to sidestep the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides
    that powers
      not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the
    people and the states.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
    Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
    and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of local
    public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
    don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
    to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not taxed
    if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation reduces
    the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
    funds in an enterprise.</p>
  <p>When public finance is based on land value taxation, government revenues flow
    up, instead of trickling down from the federal government to the states and
    then to local governments. Real estate taxes today are assessed and collected
    primarily by county governments; under a system of land value taxation, funds
    raised would flow up from the counties to the states, and only then to the
    federal government.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would create a decentralizing force, shifting or &#8220;devolving&#8221; power
    down to local government in accord with the principle of subsidiarity: that
    which can be most efficiently done by individuals or smaller jurisdictions
    should not be done by larger or higher-level jurisdictions. Government functions
    would then come under more observation and control by the voters, who can
    monitor and alter local governments much more easily than remote federal
    agencies.... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

  <p>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value, how
    would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public needs?<br>
    A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
    values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth,
    are not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values
    of the state at large.</p>

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
    state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
    with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
  expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
    on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
    of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
    state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
    its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
    (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
    all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
    society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
    descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
    the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
    ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
    holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
    wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
    unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
    for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
  above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.
