<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,

George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> OR let him go to Edinburgh, the &quot;modern Athens,&quot; of which Scotsmen
    speak with pride, and in buildings from whose roofs a bowman might strike
    the spires of twenty churches he will find human beings living as he would
    not keep his meanest dog. Let him toil up the stairs of one of those monstrous
    buildings, let him enter one of those &quot;dark houses,&quot; let him close
    the door, and in the blackness think what life must be in such a place. Then
    let him try the reduction to iniquity. And if he go to that good charity
    (but, alas! how futile is Charity without Justice!) where little children
    are kept while their mothers are at work, and children are fed who would
    otherwise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs are shrunken from want
    of nourishment. Perhaps they may tell him, as they told me, of that little
    girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who, when they gave her bread, raised
    her eyes and clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Heaven for His
    bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think, of its terrible
    meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child, thankful for
    that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard? If
    not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
    bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
    to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths
    of the sea? &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll),
    The Nineteenth Century, July, 1884</p>
  <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced
                      countries we regard it as the natural lot of the great
                  masses of the
                      people; that we take it as a matter of course that even
                  in our highest civilization
                          large
                            classes should want the necessaries of healthful
                  life, and the vast majority
                            should only get a poor and pinched living by the
                  hardest toil. There are professors of political economy who
                  teach that
                      this condition
                      of
                        things is
                            the result of social laws of which it is idle to
                  complain! There are ministers of religion who preach that this
                  is the
                    condition which
                        an all-wise,
                          all-powerful
                            Creator intended for His children! If an architect
                  were to build a theater so that not more than one-tenth of
                  the audience
                      could see
                      and hear, we
                          should call him a bungler and a botcher. If a man were
                    to give
                      a feast and provide
                            so little food that nine-tenths of his guests must
                  go away hungry, we should call him a fool, or worse. Yet so
                  accustomed
                      are we to
                      poverty, that even
                            the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell
                  us that
                      the great Architect of the Universe, to whose infinite
                  skill all nature
                      testifies,
                          has made such
                            a botch job of this world that the vast majority
                  of the human creatures whom He has called into it are condemned
                  by the
                    conditions
                      he has imposed
                          to want,
                            suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity
                      for the development
                            of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely
                            live! &#8212; Social Problems </p>
