  <strong>Joseph Priestley</strong>
</div>
<p>Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) was a Renaissance man, a friend of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, and an important scientist and thinker. See this 2009 article in Salon, <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2009/01/09/johnson/print.html">Father of the Ecosystem</a>. Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_priestley">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_priestley</a> </p>
<p>Henry George's <em><a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em>, written in 1879, opens with these paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <h2 class="style1 style2">The Problem</h2>
  <p><span class="style2 style3">[01] </span><strong>The present century has been marked                 by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing power. The utilization                 of steam and electricity, the introduction of improved processes                 and laborsaving machinery, the greater subdivision and grander scale                 of production, the wonderful facilitation of exchanges, have multiplied                 enormously the effectiveness of labor. </strong></p>
  <p><span class="style3">[02]</span> At the beginning                 of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and it was expected,                 that laborsaving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the                 condition of the laborer; that the enormous increase in the power                 of producing wealth would make real poverty a thing of the past.                 <strong>Could a man of the last century &#8212; a Franklin or a Priestley &#8212; have                 seen, in a vision of the future</strong>, the steamship taking the place                 of the sailing vessel, the railroad train of the wagon, the reaping                 machine of the scythe, the threshing machine of the flail; could                 he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience to human                 will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater                 than that of all the men and all the beasts of burden of the earth                 combined; could he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished                 lumber &#8212; into doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly                 the touch of a human hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes                 are turned out by the case with less labor than the old-fashioned                 cobbler could have put on a sole; the factories where, under the                 eye of a girl, cotton becomes cloth faster than hundreds of stalwart                 weavers could have turned it out with their hand looms; could he                 have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and mighty anchors,                 and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the diamond drill cutting                 through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil sparing the whale;                 could he have realized the enormous saving of labor resulting from                 improved facilities of exchange and communication &#8212; sheep killed                 in Australia eaten fresh in England, and the order given by the                 London banker in the afternoon executed in San Francisco in the                 morning of the same day; <strong>could he have conceived of the hundred                 thousand improvements which these only suggest, what would he have                 inferred as to the social condition of mankind? </strong></p>
  <p><span class="style3">[03]</span> It would not have                 seemed like an inference; further than the vision went it would                 have seemed as though he saw; and his heart would have leaped and                 his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height beholds                 just ahead of the thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of rustling                 woods and the glint of laughing waters. <strong>Plainly, in the sight of                 the imagination, he would have beheld these new forces elevating                 society from its very foundations, lifting the very poorest above                 the possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from anxiety                 for the material needs of life; he would have seen these slaves                 of the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse,                 these muscles of iron and sinews of steel making the poorest laborer's                 life a holiday, in which every high quality and noble impulse could                 have scope to grow. </strong></p>
  <p><span class="style3">[04]</span> And out of these                 bounteous material conditions he would have seen arising, as necessary                 sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden age of which mankind                 have always dreamed. ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley's contributions to science are perhaps less widely known in the 21st century than Benjamin Franklin's, but, as the Salon article makes clear, he was quite a thinker about issues we continue to confront in the 21st century, with regard to, among other things, sustainability. Steven Johnson describes him as a pioneer in the &quot;open source&quot; model.</p>
