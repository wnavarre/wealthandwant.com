<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which every
      human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was fixed in
      supply, the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to
      enjoy exclusive rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer
      majority from land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners
      in order to access this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of
      rents by landowners allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing
      to the productive efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did
      the demand for land, forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition,
      increases in land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such
      as roads and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the
      expense of the community. Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged
      speculation in land, pushing prices even higher, while exposing the economy
      to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;.</p>
  <p>One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land nationalisation.
                But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on land could
    be effective in capturing the economic surplus arising from land ownership.
    This tax would
                generate all the revenue necessary to fund public expenditures.
    George thought that such a land tax would permit the removal of other taxes
    on labour and
                capital, which he regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued
    that taxes on incomes, sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives
    to production
                and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and creating
    a barrier to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be both economically
    efficient
                and more equitable in its distributional effects. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q9. Does not the single tax mean the nationalization of land?</em><br>
    A. No; as Henry George has said, &quot;the primary error of the advocates
    of land nationalization is in their confusion of equal rights with joint
    rights. ... In truth, the right to the use of land is not a joint or common
    right, but an equal right; a joint or common right is to rent.&quot;* It
    means rather the socialization of economic rent. It simply proposes gradually
    to divert an increasing share of ground rent into the public treasury.<br>
    *<em><a href="../../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A Perplexed Philosopher, Part III, Chapter XI: Compensation</a></em></p>
  <p><em>Q11. Does not the common right to rent involve common ownership of land?</em><br>
A. Not in the least. When the economic rent is appropriated by the community
  for common purposes, individual ownership of land could and should continue.
  Such ownership would carry all the present rights of the landowner to use,
  control, and dispose of land, so that nothing like common ownership of land
  would be necessary.</p>
  <p><em>Q12. Did not Henry George believe in the abolition of private property in
    land?</em><br>
    A. Assuredly not. If he did, why was it that he suggested no modification
    whatever of present land tenure or &quot;estate in land&quot;? If he did,
    how could he have said that the sole &quot;sovereign&quot; and sufficient
    remedy for the wrongs of private property in land was &quot;to appropriate
    rent by taxation&quot;?</p>
  <p><em>Q59. Is it correct to say that &quot;land&quot; is one thing, and the &quot;rent
    of land&quot; another and quite different thing, and that to take in taxation
    the rent of land it is not necessary to take the land itself?</em><br>
    A. Ninety-one professors of political economy have answered &quot;Yes.&quot; Twenty-three
    have answered &quot;No.&quot; ... <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
