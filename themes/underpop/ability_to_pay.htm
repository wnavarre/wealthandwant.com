<blockquote>
  <p>We frequently talk about &quot;ability to pay&quot; as one of the criteria for judging
    a tax. But this page makes the case that it is an imprecise criterion, and
    that it is not as good a criterion as we are used to considering it to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</strong><br />
    <br />
Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon men
in proportion to their <em>ability to pay</em>, and (2) taxes that are levied
in proportion to the <em>benefits received</em> by the tax-payer from the public.
Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though probate and inheritance
taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only important one of the second
class.</p>
  <p> There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two. To tax in proportion
    to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy. The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p> But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the piratical
    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">12. It is often said, for instance, by its advocates,
        that house owners should in justice contribute to the support of the
        fire departments that protect them and it is even gravely argued that
        houses are more appropriate subjects of taxation than land; because they
        need protection, whereas land needs none. Read note 8.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">13. Following is an interesting computation of the cost
        and loss to the city of Boston of the present mixed system of taxation
        as compared with the single tax; The computation was made by James R.
        Carret, Esq., the leading conveyancer of Boston:</font></p>

    Polls ... .... ... .... .... ...272,750 &nbsp;&nbsp;2.31%</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But to ascertain the total cost to the people of Boston
        of the present system of taxation for the taxable year, beginning May
        1, 1892, there should be added to the taxes assessed upon them what it
        cost them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the use of the
        land, being the net ground rent, which I estimate at four per cent on
        the land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Total tax levy, May 1, 1892 ... ... ... ... .... ....
        .... .... .... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..$11,805,036<br>

    <p><font size="-1">To contrast this with what the single tax system would
        have cost the people of Boston for that year, take the gross ground rent,
        found by adding to the net ground rent the taxation on land values for
        that year, being $12.90 per $1000, or 1.29 per cent added to 4 per cent
        = 5.29 per cent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Total cost of present system as above .. .... .... ....
        .... .... .... .... .... ....$27,771,843<br>

    <p><font size="-1">But the present system not only costs the people more

      .... .... .... .. ..... ..$9,311,066</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the
        present system and the single tax, for large amounts of real estate are
        exempt from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth,
        by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by charitable,
        literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount of the value
        of land so held as returned by the assessors for the year 1892 is $60,626,171.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should
        be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of the public
        burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here. There is good
        reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
        to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an indication
        of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
        October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were
        valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report) at $52,712,600.
        I believe that this represents not more than fifty per cent of their
        true market value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property
        and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think $500,000,000
        to be a fair estimate of the land values of Boston. Making this the basis
        of contrast, we have:</font></p>

  <p><strong>  <font size="-1">3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</font></strong><br />
  <br />
  To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
  service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and
  now, in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in
  proportion to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government
  must use land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government
  is poor to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits
  of good government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many
  and fully enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government
  are available, or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest
  and most available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would
  work or live where the benefits of government are available, and does not already
  own land there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other
  things being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that
  the site he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service
  of government in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public
  which provides the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor government
        than in any country of better government, other things being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government. Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.
    But landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts,
    and of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and
    the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with
    the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their
    property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government which its
    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
        respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence and
        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year! &quot; you
        exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
        for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
        if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down; they
        have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be 'held up'
        and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out in the spring,
        your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs, and if you walk you
        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.
        Isn't it worth a hundred and fifty dollars a year more for a building
        site here than over in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
        But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,
        what would be the conversation if your sense of the fitness of things
        were not warped by familiarity with false systems of taxation? Would
        it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
        the assessor. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
        your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What

  <p><em>Q18. How would you reach the bondholder, or the man with money alone?</em><br>
  A. Why should we wish to reach him if his bonds or his money represent labor
        products to which he has honestly acquired a just title? This question
        is a legitimate offspring of the plundering theory that men should be
        taxed according to their ability to pay, the merits of which are considered
        on pages 7-9. It is a question which may also have been suggested by
        the fact that &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; are
        so often men who have special privileges which coin money for them. There
        is a feeling that it would be unfair to allow such special privileges
        to escape taxation. It would be. But inquiry will show that the most
        important of these privileges rest in the ownership of land, and that
        the &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; whom the questioner
        probably has in mind, are in fact great landlords; that is to say, that
        their fortunes are really based upon land. When land values were taxed,
        the great source of unearned incomes &#8212; land monopoly &#8212; would
        be practically abolished, and bondholders and men of money would be only
        those who earn what they have. Such property no man of honest instincts
        should wish to expropriate. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The Taxable Surplus
  of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable surplus is also what you
        can tax without driving land into the wrong use.</span> It is not enough
        that the land supply is fixed: a tax must not force underuse or other
        misuse of the fixed supply. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of taxing rent
    is that it does not change the ranking of land uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let
    me explain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    In a free market, the function of rent is to sort and arrange land uses:
    landowners allocate land to those uses yielding the most net product, or
    rent. Economists have shown (and you can easily see) that this is socially
    advantageous: the net product is the excess of revenue over all costs, so
    land yielding the highest rent is adding its utmost to the national product. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    When you base your tax on the net product (or rent), the ranking of rival
    land uses remains the same after-tax as it was before-tax. That is, if use "A" yields
    20% more rent than use "B", and a tax takes 50% of the rent, then use A still
    yields the owner 20% more after-tax than use B, and the owner still prefers
    use A. We will see below, (<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">Section
    D</a>), that when you tax something other than rent (say the Gross Revenue,
    G), you will drive the land into less intensive uses, or out of use altogether. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A related advantage of taxing rent
    is that you can often levy the tax on the land's <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>to
    yield rent, regardless of what use the owner actually chooses.</span> This
    is, indeed, a standard way of taxing rent in most capitalist nations. It
    is possible because buyers and sellers trade land based on their careful
    estimates of its maximum rent-yielding capability. The tax valuer observes
    and records these value data, and uses them to place a value on all comparable
    lands. Many books and manuals and professional journals have been published
    on the techniques used: it is a well established art, with its own professional
    associations, of which our speaker Mr. Gwartney is a leading member. <br>
&nbsp; <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a tax is limited to the maximum possible
    rent, and so will not exceed a landowner's ability to pay - provided he uses
    the land in the most economical manner (which is not always the most intensive
    manner). It will surely not interfere with his using the land in the best
    way, but will discourage using it any other way. ...</span></small></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you base a tax on taxable surplus,
      and keep the tax proportional to taxable surplus, you levy taxes without
      twisting and inverting the landowner's or land manager's ranking of land
      uses. </span>As noted before, the owner's preferred use after tax remains
      the same as it would be without any tax. On
the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">if you
tax on some other basis</span> (Gross Revenue, for example), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">you
bias the owner
against uses more heavily taxed.</span></span> To keep the example simple, and
generally
realistic, we assume here that the seller is a "price-taker," meaning he sells
on a world market and cannot raise the price, and so has no choice but to bear
the tax. ... <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">read the whole article</a></p>
