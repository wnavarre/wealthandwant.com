      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nevertheless, many economists have recognized and supported land value taxation
    for public finance. L&eacute;on Walras, known for his development of general-equilibrium
    theory, wrote land rent provides the best means for funding a state.22 Knut
    Wicksell, a Swedish economist who integrated classical, neoclassical, and Austrian
    economic thought, wrote, &#8220;the general economic development of the community&#8221; increased
    the value of its land, and he proposed taxing such increases.23 Contemporary
    economists who have written favorably about land value taxation include Kris
    Feder, Mason Gaffney, C. Lowell Harris, Fred Harrison, Nicolaus Tideman,
    the late William Vickrey (winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize in economics), and
    myself.</p>
  <p>Other economists have opposed the public collection of rent. William Fischel
    (1998) accuses land value taxation of high administrative costs in &#8220;the
    knife-edge goal&#8221; of &#8220;getting almost all land rent.&#8221; He
    does not say why there has to be such an impossible &#8220;knife-edge goal.&#8221; Others
    claim the administrative costs of property taxes are greater than for income
    taxes. But even if this is so, real property taxes already exist, so eliminating
    income and sales taxes can only reduce total tax-collecting costs, not increase
  them. ... </p>
  <p>Costs of collection and administration</p>
  <p>Consider the effect of abolishing income taxes and sales taxes, replacing
    them with a land value tax. There would no longer be any tax audits. There
    would be no record-keeping for taxes. You, the landowner, would instead get
    a monthly bill, like you get for utilities. You would simply pay the bill
    or have it automatically deducted from some financial account. At the same
    time, government would avoid the high cost of processing complex accounts
    and keeping individual tax records. It would only need to keep real estate
    records and assess the land values, both of which it already does for property
    tax purposes.</p>
  <p>Those who are retired or temporarily have little cash income would be able
    to defer taxes by accumulating liens on the real estate until they die or
    sell the property, as is commonly done today with real estate taxes.</p>
  <p>If you thought the assessment of the land value was too high, you could
    appeal, as one can today&#8217;s real estate taxes. The land value assessments
    would be public records available on the Internet, unlike income tax records,
    which are quite properly hidden from public view. You could easily compare
    your assessment with those of your neighbors. If the appeals board rejected
    your claim, the assessment could be appealed to a jury, if you were willing
    to pay the cost of the jury&#8217;s decision.</p>
  <p>Nobody would be sent to prison for tax evasion, because there would be no
    tax evasion. A non-payer would lose title to his land or lose the protective
    services of government, depending on the local enforcement practice. Property
    taxes are already being assessed and collected by counties in the U.S. A
    complete shift to the taxation of land values would not increase these costs,
    but would eliminate the expenses involved in collecting sales and income
    taxes.<br>
