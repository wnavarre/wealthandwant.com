<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and
      all necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature
      dictates
        that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his
        own personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to
        enable
        them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
        of this mortal life.<strong> Now, in no other way can a father effect
        this except by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit
        to his
        children by inheritance.</strong> (14.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p><strong>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property
      that will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? </strong>Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      <strong>The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private
      property in land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is
      land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals.</strong> It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? <strong>Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them!</strong> Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land
                                          in the richest of so-called Christian
        countries? Is it not that
                                              young
                                                people fear to marry; that married
                people fear to have children; that
                                                  children
                                                    are
                                                      driven
                                                        out of
                                                          life from sheer want
        of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil when they ought
                        to be at school or at
                                              play; that great
                                                  numbers of
                                                        those who
                                                          attain maturity enter
        it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves, undeveloped minds &#8212; under
                                            conditions that foredoom them, not
        merely to suffering, but to crime;
                                                that fit them in
                                                      advance for the
                                                      prison and
                                                          the brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!
    <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong> </font></p>
  <p><br>
    I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
      remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness
      dictates that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the
      remedies proposed or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see

    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material

    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
