    <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political
    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em></strong>,
1883)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-2">[07]</font> Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual conversion
  of government into something independent of and beyond the people, and the
  gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &#8212; though not necessarily
  a class marked off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history
  shows, personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the concentration
  of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each
  knows his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city, as we
  have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers to gain and
  hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State
  legislatures, the growth of the country and the greater number of interests
  make the proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents
  know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
  departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
                  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
                  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
                  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
                  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
                  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
                  continued to abhor
                  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
                  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
                  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
                  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
                  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
                  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
                  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
                  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
                  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
                  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
                  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
                  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
                  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
                  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
                  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
                  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
                  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
                  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
                  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
                  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
                  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
                  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
                  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
        of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize, and they listen to quacks
        who propose to cure the symptoms without touching the disease. &quot;Let us
        elect good men to office,&quot; say the quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds
        by sprinkling salt on their tails!</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[13]</font> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of popular government
        in the United States is clearly a failure. Not that it is a failure everywhere
        and in everything. An experiment of this kind does not have to be fully worked
        out to be proved a failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from
        the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our government
        by the people has in large degree become, is in larger degree becoming, government
        by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
      <p><font size="-2">[14]</font> The people, of course, continue to vote; but the people are losing their
        power. Money and organization tell more and more in elections. In some sections
        bribery has become chronic, and numbers of voters expect regularly to sell
        their votes. In some sections large employers regularly bulldoze their hands
        into voting as they wish. In municipal, State and Federal politics the power
        of the &quot;machine&quot; is increasing. In many places it has become so strong
        that the ordinary citizen has no more influence in the government under which
        he lives than he would have in China. He is, in reality, not one of the governing
        classes, but one of the governed. He occasionally, in disgust, votes for &quot;the
        other man,&quot; or &quot;the other party;&quot; but, generally, to find that
        he has effected only a change of masters, or secured the same masters under
        different names. And he is beginning to accept the situation, and to leave
        politics to politicians, as something with which an honest, self-respecting
        man cannot afford to meddle. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
