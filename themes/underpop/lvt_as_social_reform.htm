<blockquote>
  <p>    III. THE SINGLE TAX AS A SOCIAL REFORM.</p>
  <p>But the single tax is more than a revenue system. Great as are its merits
    in this respect, they are but incidental to its character as a social reform.31
    And that some social reform, which shall be simple in method but fundamental
    in character, is most urgently needed we have only to look about us to see.</p>
  <p>Poverty is widespread and pitiable. This we know. Its
                        general manifestations are so common that even good men
                        look
                        upon it as a providential
                              provision for enabling the rich to drive camels
                    through needles' eyes by exercising
                                    the modern virtue of organized giving.32
                    Its occasional manifestations in recurring periods of &quot;hard times&quot;33
                            are like epidemics of a virulent disease, which excite
                        even the most contented
                                  to ask if they
                                  may not be the
                                    next victims. Its spasms of violence threaten
                        society with anarchy on the one hand, and, through panic-stricken
                            efforts at restraint,
                                  with loss
                                  of
                                    liberty on the other. And it persists and
                    deepens despite the continuous increase of wealth producing
                        power.34</p>
  <p>That much of our poverty is involuntary may be proved, if proof be necessary,
    by the magnitude of charitable work that aims to help only the &quot;deserving
    poor&quot;; and as to undeserving cases &#8212; the cases of voluntary poverty &#8212; who
    can say but that they, if not due to birth and training in the environs of
    degraded poverty, 35 are the despairing culminations of long-continued struggles
    for respectable independence? 36 How can we know that they are not essentially
    like the rest &#8212; involuntary and deserving? It is a profound distinction
    that a clever writer of fiction 37 makes when he speaks of &quot;the hopeful
    and the hopeless poor.&quot; There is, indeed, little difference between
    voluntary and involuntary poverty, between the &quot;deserving&quot; and
    the &quot;undeserving&quot; poor, except that the &quot;deserving&quot; still
    have hope, while from the &quot;undeserving&quot; all hope, if they ever
    knew any, has gone.</p>
  <p>But it is not alone to objects of charity that the question of poverty calls
    our attention. There is a keener poverty, which pinches and goes hungry,
    but is beyond the reach of charity because it never complains. And back of
    all and over all is fear of poverty, which chills the best instincts of men
    of every social grade, from recipients of out-door relief who dread the poorhouse,
    to millionaires who dread the possibility of poverty for their children if
    not for themselves.38</p>
  <p>It is poverty and fear of poverty that prompt men of honest instincts to
    steal, to bribe, to take bribes, to oppress, either under color of law or
    against law, and &#8212; what is worst than all, because it is not merely
    a depraved act, but a course of conduct that implies a state of depravity &#8212; to
    enlist their talents in crusades against their convictions. 39 Our civilization
    cannot long resist such enemies as poverty and fear of poverty breed; to
    intelligent observers it already seems to yield. 40</p>
  <p>    But how is the development of these social enemies to be arrested? Only by
      tracing poverty to its cause, and, having found the cause, deliberately
      removing it. Poverty cannot be traced to its cause, however, without serious
      thought; not mere reading and school study and other tutoring, but thought.
      41 To jump at a conclusion is very likely to jump over the cause, at which
      no class is more apt than the tutored class.42 We must proceed step by
      step from familiar and indisputable premises. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read
