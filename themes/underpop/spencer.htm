<blockquote>
  <p>Herbert Spencer's early writings, including <em>Social Statics</em>, were
      of an entirely different spirit from his later writings. Henry George called
      attention to the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Herbert Spencer: <em>Social Statics</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Given a race of beings having like claims to pursue the objects of their
    desires; given a world adapted to the gratification of those desires &#8212;      a
    world into which such beings are similarly born &#8212; and it unavoidably
    follows that they equal rights to the use of this world. For if each of them
    has &quot;freedom
          to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the  equal freedom
    of any other,&quot; then each of them is free to use the earth  for the satisfaction
          of his wants, provided he allows all others the  same liberty. And
          conversely, it is manifest that no one, or part of them, may use the
          earth in such
          a way as to prevent the rest from similarly using it; seeing that to
          do this
          is
        to assume greater freedom than the rest, and consequently to break the
          law.</p>
  <p>Equity, therefore, does not permit property in land. For if one portion
     of the earth's surface may justly become the possession of an individual
    and
      may be held by him for his sole use and benefit as a thing to which  he
    has an exclusive right, then other portions of the earth's surface may be
    so held;
      and eventually the whole of the earth's surface may be  so held, and our
    planet may thus lapse altogether into private hands. Observe now the dilemma
    to which
      this leads. Suppose the entire  habitable globe to be so enclosed, it follows
      that if the landowners  have a valid right to its surface, all who are
    not landowners have no right at all to its surface. Hence, such can exist
    on the
      earth by  sufferance only. They are all trespassers. Save by the permission
      of the  lords of the soil, they can have no room for the soles of their
    feet. Nay, should the others think fit to deny them a resting place, these
    landless
      men
      might equitably be expelled from the earth altogether. If,  then, the assumption
      that land can be held as property involves that the  whole globe may become
      the private domain of a part of its inhabitants;  and if, by consequence,
    the rest of its inhabitants can then exercise their faculties &#8212; then
    exist even
      &#8212; only by consent of the landowners,  it is manifest than an exclusive
    possession of the soil necessitates an infringement of the law of equal freedom.
    For
      men who cannot &quot;live and  move and have their being&quot; without
      the leave of others cannot be equally free with those others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Herbert Spencer, quoted by James Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
    Policy</a>&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;You have turned over the soil to a few inches in depth with a spade
    or a plough; you have scattered over this prepared surface a few seeds ;
    and you have gathered the fruits which the sun, rain, and air helped the
    soil to produce. Just tell me, if you please, by what magic have these acts
    made you sole owner of that vast mass of matter, having for its base the
    surface of your estate, and for its apex the centre of the globe? . . . You
    say truly, when you say that 'whilst they were unreclaimed these lands belonged
    to all men.' And it is my duty to tell you that they belong to all men still;
    and that your ' improvements' as you call them, cannot vitiate the claim
    of all men. You may plough and harrow, and sow and reap; you may turn over
    the soil as often as you like; but all your manipulations will fail to make
    that soil yours, which was not yours to begin with. . . . This extra worth
    which your labour has imparted to it is fairly yours . . . but admitting
    this, is quite a different thing from recognising your right to the land
    itself.&quot; [Herbert Spencer, Social Statics, 1851, ix, 4]</p>

<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry
George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>GREAT as John Stuart Mill was and pure as he was &#8212; warm heart
        and noble mind &#8212; he yet never saw the true harmony of economic
        laws, nor realized how from this one great fundamental wrong flow want
        and misery, and vice and shame. Else he could never have written this
        sentence: "The land of Ireland, the land of every country, belongs to
        the people of that country. The individuals called landowners have no
        right in morality and justice to anything but the rent, or compensation
        for its salable value." <br>
            <br>
In the name of the Prophet &#8212; figs! If the land of any country belong to
the people of that country, what right, in morality and justice, have the individuals
called landowners to the rent? If the land belong to the people, why in the name
of morality and justice should the people pay its salable value for their own? <br>
            <br>
Herbert Spencer says: "Had we to deal with the parties who originally robbed
the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter?" Why
not make short work of the matter anyhow? For this robbery is not like the robbery
of a horse or a sum of money, that ceases with the act. It is a fresh and continuous
robbery, that goes on every day and every hour. It is not from the produce of
the past that rent is drawn; it is from the produce of the present. It is a toll
levied upon labor constantly and continuously. Every blow of the hammer, every
stroke of the pick, every thrust of the shuttle, every throb of the steam engine
pay it tribute. It levies upon the earnings of the men who, deep underground,
risk their lives, and of those who over white surges hang to reeling masts; it
claims the just reward of the capitalist and the fruits of the inventor's patient
effort; it takes little children from play and from school, and compels them
to work before their bones are hard or their muscles are firm; it robs the shivering
of warmth; the hungry, of food; the sick, of medicine; the anxious, of peace.
It debases, and embrutes, and embitters. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book
