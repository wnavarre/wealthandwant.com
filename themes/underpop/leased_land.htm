                            of Labor &#8212; An
                        Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
      of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
      meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading
      it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property
      in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property.
      With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private
      property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation.
      You urge:</p>
    <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
      paragraph 5) ...<br>
      2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
      (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
      3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
      paragraph 8.) ...<br>
      4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
      paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
      5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
      of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
      sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
      6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
      in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
      7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
      and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.)
      ...<br>
      8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
      from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
      value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
      owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
    <p><strong>  4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. </strong>(9-10.)</p>
    <p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended on land gives a right
      to ownership of the land, and that the improvement of land creates benefits
      indistinguishable and inseparable from the land itself.</p>
    <p>This contention, if valid, could only justify the ownership of land by
      those who expend industry on it. It would not justify private property
      in land as it exists. On the contrary, it would justify a gigantic no-rent
      declaration that would take land from those who now legally own it, the
      landlords, and turn it over to the tenants and laborers. And if it also
      be that improvements cannot be distinguished and separated from the land
      itself, how could the landlords claim consideration even for improvements
      they had made?</p>
    <p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words imply. What you really mean,
      I take it, is that the original justification and title of landownership
      is in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither can this justify private
      property in land as it exists. For is it not all but universally true that
      existing land titles do not come from use, but from force or fraud?</p>
    <p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part of the land of Italy
      is held by those who so far from ever having expended industry on it have
      been mere appropriators of the industry of those who have? Is this not
      also true of Great Britain and of other countries? Even in the United States,
      where the forces of concentration have not yet had time fully to operate
      and there has been some attempt to give land to users, it is probably true
      today that the greater part of the land is held by those who neither use
      it nor propose to use it themselves, but merely hold it to compel others
      to pay them for permission to use it.</p>
    <p>And if industry give ownership to land what are the limits of this ownership?
      If a man may acquire the ownership of several square miles of land by grazing
      sheep on it, does this give to him and his heirs the ownership of the same
      land when it is found to contain rich mines, or when by the growth of population
      and the progress of society it is needed for farming, for gardening, for
      the close occupation of a great city? Is it on the rights given by the
      industry of those who first used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes
      that you would found the title to the land now covered by the city of New
      York and having a value of thousands of millions of dollars?</p>
    <p>But your contention is not valid. Industry expended on land gives ownership
      in the fruits of that industry, but not in the land itself, just as industry
      expended on the ocean would give a right of ownership to the fish taken
      by it, but not a right of ownership in the ocean. Nor yet is it true that
      private ownership of land is necessary to secure the fruits of labor on
      land; nor does the improvement of land create benefits indistinguishable
      and inseparable from the land itself. That secure possession is necessary
      to the use and improvement of land I have already explained, but that ownership
      is not necessary is shown by the fact that in all civilized countries land
      owned by one person is cultivated and improved by other persons. Most of
      the cultivated land in the British Islands, as in Italy and other countries,
      is cultivated not by owners but by tenants. And so the costliest buildings
      are erected by those who are not owners of the land, but who have from
      the owner a mere right of possession for a time on condition of certain
      payments. Nearly the whole of London has been built in this way, and in
      New York, Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne, as well
      as in continental cities, the owners of many of the largest edifices will
      be found to be different persons from the owners of the ground. So far
      from the value of improvements being inseparable from the value of land,
      it is in individual transactions constantly separated. For instance, one-half
      of the land on which the immense Grand Pacific Hotel in Chicago stands
      was recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is a not infrequent occurrence
      for one person to own a fruit-tree and another to own the ground in which
      it is implanted.</p>
    <p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether it be clearing, plowing,
      manuring, cultivating, the digging of cellars, the opening of wells or
      the building of houses, that so long as its usefulness continues does not
      have a value clearly distinguishable from the value of the land. For land
      having such improvements will always sell or rent for more than similar
      land without them.</p>
    <p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what the land irrespective
      of improvement would bring, it will take the benefits of mere ownership,
      but will leave the full benefits of use and improvement, which the prevailing
      system does not do. And since the holder, who would still in form continue
      to be the owner, could at any time give or sell both possession and improvements,
      subject to future assessment by the state on the value of the land alone,
      he will be perfectly free to retain or dispose of the full amount of property
      that the exertion of his labor or the investment of his capital has attached
      to or stored up in the land.</p>
    <p>Thus, what we propose would secure, as it is impossible in any other way
      to secure, what you properly say is just and right &#8212; &#8221;that
      the results of labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; But private
      property in land &#8212; to allow the holder without adequate payment to
      the state to take for himself the benefit of the value that attaches to
      land with social growth and improvement &#8212; does take the results of
      labor from him who has labored, does turn over the fruits of one man&#8217;s
      labor to be enjoyed by another. For labor, as the active factor, is the
      producer of all wealth. Mere ownership produces nothing. A man might own
      a world, but so sure is the decree that &#8220;by the sweat of thy brow
      shalt thou eat bread,&#8221; that without labor he could not get a meal
      or provide himself a garment. Hence, when the owners of land, by virtue
      of their ownership and without laboring themselves, get the products of
      labor in abundance, these things must come from the labor of others, must
      be the fruits of others&#8217; sweat, taken from those who have a right
      to them and enjoyed by those who have no right to them.</p>
    <p>The only utility of private ownership of land as distinguished from possession
      is the evil utility of giving to the owner products of labor he does not
      earn. For until land will yield to its owner some return beyond that of
      the labor and capital he expends on it &#8212; that is to say, until by
      sale or rental he can without expenditure of labor obtain from it products
      of labor, ownership amounts to no more than security of possession, and
      has no value. Its importance and value begin only when, either in the present
      or prospectively, it will yield a revenue &#8212; that is to say, will
      enable the owner as owner to obtain products of labor without exertion
      on his part, and thus to enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</p>
    <p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery involved in private
      property in land is that in the most striking cases the robbery is not
      of individuals, but of the community. For, as I have before explained,
      it is impossible for rent in the economic sense &#8212; that value which
      attaches to land by reason of social growth and improvement &#8212; to
      go to the user. It can go only to the owner or to the community. Thus those
      who pay enormous rents for the use of land in such centers as London or
      New York are not individually injured. Individually they get a return for
      what they pay, and must feel that they have no better right to the use
      of such peculiarly advantageous localities without paying for it than have
      thousands of others. And so, not thinking or not caring for the interests
      of the community, they make no objection to the system.</p>
    <p>It recently came to light in New York that a man having no title whatever
      had been for years collecting rents on a piece of land that the growth
      of the city had made very valuable. Those who paid these rents had never
      stopped to ask whether he had any right to them. They felt that they had
      no right to land that so many others would like to have, without paying
      for it, and did not think of, or did not care for, the rights of all. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q15. How will the single tax affect leases already made? Will the loss of
    declining values fall upon the owner or the lessee?</em><br>
    A. That will depend upon the covenants in the lease. It behooves tenants
    to see to it that their leases contain provisions in this respect. If they
    fail to protect themselves they cannot complain in case they suffer when
    the single tax comes into operation. They will have had ample warning, and
    their misfortune will be due to their own negligence. ...</p>
  <p><em>Q32. Is not ownership of land necessary to induce its improvement? Does
      not history show that private ownership is a step in advance of common
      ownership?</em><br>
A. No. Private use was doubtless a step in advance of common use. And because
private use seems to us to have been brought about under the institution of private
ownership, private ownership appears to the superficial to have been the real
advance. But a little observation and reflection will remove that impression.
Private ownership of land is not necessary to its private use. And so far from
inducing improvement, private ownership retards it. When a man owns land he may
accumulate wealth by doing nothing with the land, simply allowing the community
to increase its value while he pays a merely nominal tax, upon the plea that
he gets no income from the property. But when the possessor has to pay the value
of his land every year, as he would have to under the single tax, and as ground
renters do now, he must improve his holding in order to profit by it. Private
possession of land, without profit except from use, promotes improvement; private
ownership, with profit regardless of use, retards improvement. Every city in
the world, in its vacant lots, offers proof of the statement. It is the lots
that are owned, and not those that are held upon ground-lease, that remain vacant.</p>
