<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts
    of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985
study &#8220;Who Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
      sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or
      two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to
      the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in
      land. American cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at
      least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of
      total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers
      reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
      because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market
      price from the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive
      market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a
      penalty on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their
      maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden
      would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for
      their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
      challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
      particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes,
      evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated
      with administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve
  disputes over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    <strong>The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. </strong>The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    <strong>Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</strong></p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38</p>
