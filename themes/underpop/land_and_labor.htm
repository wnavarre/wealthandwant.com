<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thus all artificial objects external to man &#8212; Wealth, are found to
    have their ultimate source in the conjunction of man's activities &#8212; Labor,
    with natural objects external to man &#8212; Land.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Wealth is produced solely by the application of Labor to Land.51</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">50. It may at first seem like a great waste of time and
        space to have gone through this long analysis for no other purpose at
        last than to demonstrate the self-evident fact that land and labor are
        the sole original factors in the production of Wealth. But it will have
        been no waste if it enables the reader to firmly grasp the fact. Nothing
        is more obvious, to be sure. Nothing is more readily assented to. Yet
        by layman and college professor and economic author alike, this simple
        truth is cast adrift at the very threshold of argument or investigation,
        with results akin to what might be expected in physics if after recognizing
        the law of gravitation its effects should be completely ignored.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">51. There is ample authority among economic writers for
        this conclusion.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Professor Ely enumerates Nature, Labor, and Capital as
        the factors of production, but he describes Capital as a combination
        of Nature and Labor &#8212; Ely's Introduction, part ii, ch. iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Say describes industry as &quot; nothing more or less
        than human employment of natural agents.&quot; &#8212; Say's Trea., book
        i, ch. ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And though John Stuart Mill and numerous others speak
        of Land, Labor, and Capital as the three factors of production, as does
        Professor Jevons, most of them, like Jevons, recognize the fact, though
        in their reasoning they often fail to profit by it, that Capital is not
        a primary but a secondary requisite. See Jevons's Pol. Ec., secs. 16,
        19.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Henry George says: &quot;Land, labor, and capital are
        the factors of production. The term land includes all natural opportunities
        or forces; the term labor, all human exertion; and the term capital,
        all wealth used to produce more wealth. . . Capital is not a necessary
        factor in production. Labor exerted upon land can produce wealth without
        the aid of capital, and in the necessary genesis of things must so produce
        wealth before capital can exist.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
        book iii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Also : &quot;The complexities of production in the civilized
        state, in which so great a part is borne by exchange, and so much labor
        is bestowed upon materials after they have been separated from the land,
        though they may to the unthinking disguise, do not alter the fact that
        all production is still the union of the two factors, land and labor.&quot;&#8212; Id.,
        ch. viii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">By intelligent observers no authority is needed. In all
        the phenomena of human life, whether primitive or civilized, the lesson
        of the chart stands out in bold relief. Nothing can be produced without
        Labor and Land, and nothing can be named which under any circumstances
        enters into productive processes that is not resolvable into either the
        one or the other. To satisfy all human wants mankind requires nothing
        but human labor and natural material, and each of them is indispensable.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is the final analysis. In the union of Labor, which includes all human
    effort,52 with Land, which includes the whole material universe outside of
    man,53 we discover the ultimate source of Wealth, which includes all the
    material things that satisfy want.54 And that is the first great truth upon
    which the single tax philosophy is built.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">52. The term labor includes all human exertion in the
        production of wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book i, ch.
        ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">53. &quot;The term land necessarily includes, not merely
        the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water and the air,
        but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it is only
        by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man
        can come in contact with or use nature.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
        book i, ch. ii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">54. &quot;As commonly used the word 'wealth ' is applied
        to anything having exchange value. But ... wealth, as alone the term
        can be used in political economy, consists of natural products that have
        been secured, moved, combined, separated, or in other ways modified by
        human exertion, so as to fit them for the gratification of human desires.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book i, ch ii.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>e. Effect of Retaining Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>If society retained Rent for common purposes, all incentive to hold land
    for any other object than immediate use would disappear. The effect may be
    illustrated by a comparison of the last preceding chart with the following:
    [chart]</p>
  <p> There is but one difference between this chart and the chart immediately
    preceding. In that Rent is confiscated to private use, whereas in this Rent
    is retained for common use. All the labor force indicated with red in the
    first of the two charts would not more than utilize the space to the left
    and part of the adjoining one, which would elevate Wages to what, with the
    given labor force, could be produced from the poorer of the two spaces. After
    that, increase of Rent would not enrich land-owners at the expense of other
    classes; it would enrich the whole community.108</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">108. The laborer would receive in Distribution all that
        he earned and no more than he earned in Production; and that is the natural
        law.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In social conditions, where industry is subdivided and trade is intricate,
    it is impossible to say arbitrarily what is the equivalent of given labor.
    Hence no statute fixing the compensation for labor can really be operative.
    All that we can say is that labor is worth what men freely contract to give
    and take for it. But it must be what they freely contract to take as well
    as what they freely contract to give; and men are not free to contract for
    the sale of their labor when labor generally is so divorced from land as
    to abnormally glut the labor market and make men's sale of their labor for
    almost anything the buyer offers, the alternative of starvation. Laborers
    may be as truly enslaved by divorcing labor from land as by driving them
    with a whip. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q36. How is it possible to determine what part of a man's product is
      due to land, and what part is due to labor?</em><br>
A. All products are due wholly to the union of land and labor. Labor is the active
force, land is the passive material; and without both there can be no product
at all. But the part of a man's product that he individually earns, as distinguished
from the part that he obtains by virtue of advantageous location, is determined
by the law of rent &#8212; by what his location is worth. </p>
  <p><em>Q57. If land and labor are equally indispensable factors of production,
      why are they not equally entitled to the product?</em><br>
A. The laborer justly owns his labor, but the land-owner cannot justly own his
land. The question is not one of the relative rights of men and land, but of
men and men. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
