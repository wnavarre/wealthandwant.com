<p align="center"><strong>The Fear of Poverty</strong></p>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. <strong>And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to
    seek it, what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want.</strong> As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
  deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The
    existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights we do not
    seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it is not alone to objects of charity that the question of poverty calls
    our attention. There is a keener poverty, which pinches and goes hungry,
    but is beyond the reach of charity because it never complains. And back of
    all and over all is fear of poverty, which chills the best instincts of men
    of every social grade, from recipients of out-door relief who dread the poorhouse,
    to millionaires who dread the possibility of poverty for their children if
    not for themselves.38</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">38. A well known millionaire is quoted as saying: &quot;I
        would rather leave my children penniless in a world in which they could
        at all times
      obtain
        employment for wages equal to the value of their work as measured by
      the work of others, than to leave them millions of dollars in a world like
      this,
        where if thy lose their inheritance, they may have no chance of earning
      am decent living.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is poverty and fear of poverty that prompt men of honest
        instincts to steal, to bribe, to take bribes, to oppress, either under
        color of law
      or
        against law, and &#8212; what is worst than all, because it is not merely
        a depraved act, but a course of conduct that implies a state of depravity &#8212; to
        enlist their talents in crusades against their convictions. 39 Our civilization
        cannot long resist such enemies as poverty and fear of poverty breed;
        to intelligent observers it already seems to yield. 40</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">39. &quot;From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread
        everything pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all the
        higher possibilities of life; which converts civility into a hollow pretense,
        patriotism into a sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which makes so much
        of civilized existence an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which the weapons are
        cunning and fraud? Does it not spring from the existence of want? Carlyle
        somewhere says that poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is
        most afraid. And he is right. Poverty is the openmouthed, relentless hell
        which yawns beneath civilized society. And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare
        no truer thing than when the wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of
        Vishnu that the keenest pain is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation;
        it means shame, degradation; the searing of the most sensitive parts of our
        moral and mental nature as with hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses
        and the sweetest affections; the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You
        love your wife, you love your children; but would it not be easier to see
        them die than to see them reduced to the pinch of want in which large classes
        in every highly civilized community live? ... From this hell of poverty,
        it is but natural that men should make every effort to escape. With the impulse
        to self-preservation and self-gratification combine nobler feelings, and
        love as well as fear urges in the struggle. Many a man does a mean thing,
        a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping and unjust thing, in the effort
        to place above want, or the fear of want, mother or wife or children.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book ix, ch iv.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    But how is the development of these social enemies to be arrested? Only
    by tracing poverty to its cause, and, having found the cause, deliberately
      removing it. Poverty cannot be traced to its cause, however, without serious
      thought; not mere reading and school study and other tutoring, but thought.41
    To jump at a conclusion is very likely to jump over the cause, at which no
    class is more apt than the tutored class.42 We must proceed step by
      step from familiar and indisputable premises. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

    <br>
I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that honored, not
with the lips but with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion
to worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There
is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad struggle, we trample
in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all; trample it in the
mire while we tear and rend each other. &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a></em> <br>
  <br>
WHOSE fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make that
terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and the necessity
of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that it is the fault
of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring cholera to this country,
or the man who, having the power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort
to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty
kills more people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at the death
statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come quickest; see where it is
that the little children die like flies &#8212; it is in the poorer quarters.
And the man who looks with careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence;
the man who does not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty
of a crime. &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime of Poverty</a></em><br>
  <br>
SOCIAL progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business of each;
it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can escape.
He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes
no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden
underfoot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true Christian. Nor is
he a good citizen. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp01.html">Social

WE cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political economy to college

  <p>THAT the masses now festering in the tenement houses of our cities, under
    conditions which breed disease and death, and vice and crime, should each
    family have its healthful home, set in its garden; that the working farmer
    should be able to make a living with a daily average of two or three hours'
    work, which more resembled healthy recreation than toil; that his home should
    be replete with all the conveniences yet esteemed luxuries; that it should
    be supplied with light and heat, and power if needed, and connected with
    those of his neighbors by the telephone; that his family should be free to
    libraries, and lectures, and scientific apparatus and instruction; that they
    should be able to visit the theater, or concert, or opera, as often as they
    cared to do so, and occasionally to make trips to other parts of the country
    or to Europe; that, in short, not merely the successful man, the one in a
    thousand, but the man of ordinary parts and ordinary foresight and prudence,
    should enjoy all that advancing civilization can bring to elevate and expand
    human life, seems, in the light of existing facts, as wild a dream as ever
    entered the brain of hasheesh eater. Yet the powers already within the grasp
    of man make it easily possible.&nbsp; &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp21.html">Social

GIVE labor a free field and its full earnings; take for the benefit of the whole
community that fund which the growth of the community creates, and want and the
fear of want would be gone. The springs of production would be set free, and
the enormous increase of wealth would give the poorest ample comfort. Men would
no more worry about finding employment than they worry about finding air to breathe;
they need have no more care about physical necessities than do the lilies of
the field. The progress of science, the march of invention, the diffusion of
knowledge, would bring their benefits to all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With this abolition of want and the fear of want, the admiration of riches would
decay, and men would seek the respect and approbation of their fellows in other
modes than by the acquisition and display of wealth. In this way there would
be brought to the management of public affairs and the administration of common
funds the skill, the attention, the fidelity and integrity, that can now only
be secured for private interests, and a railroad or gas works might be operated
on public account, not only more economically and efficiently than, as at present,
under joint stock management, but as economically and efficiently as would be
possible under a single ownership. The prize of the Olympian games, that called
forth the most strenuous exertions of all Greece, was but a wreath of wild olive;
for a bit of ribbon men have over and over again performed services no money
could have bought. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>THE law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just as social
    adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the equality of right
    between man and man, just as they insure to each the perfect liberty which
    is bounded only by the equal liberty of every other, must civilization advance.
    Just as they fail in this, must advancing civilization come to a halt and
    recede. Political economy and social science cannot teach any lessons that
    are not embraced in the simple truths that were taught to poor fishermen
    and Jewish peasants by One who eighteen hundred years ago was crucified &#8212; the
    simple truths which, beneath the warpings of selfishness and the distortions
    of superstition, seem to underlie every religion that has ever striven to
    formulate the spiritual yearnings of man. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book
    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</a></p>
  <p>THE poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
    all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
    In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
    offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
    so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
    to be the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice
    and asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
    ourselves to the law &#8212; we shall remove the great cause of unnatural
    inequality in the distribution of wealth and power; we shall abolish poverty;
    tame the ruthless passions of greed; dry up the springs of vice and misery;
    light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; give new vigor to invention and
    a fresh impulse to discovery; substitute political strength for political
    weakness; and make tyranny and anarchy impossible.&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html"> &#8212; Book
