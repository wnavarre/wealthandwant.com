<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Why did this happen? There are many explanations. One is that welfare kept
    the poor poor; this was argued by Charles Murray in his 1984 book <em>Losing
    Ground</em>. Welfare, he contended, encouraged single mothers to remain unmarried,
    increased the incidence of out-of-wedlock births, and created a parasitic
    underclass. In other words, Murray (and others) blamed victims or particular
    policies for perpetuating poverty, but paid scant attention to why poverty
    exists in the first place.</p>
  <p>There are, of course, many roots, but my own hypothesis is this: much of
    what we label private wealth is taken from, or coproduced with, the commons.
    However, these takings from the commons are far from equal. To put it bluntly,
    the rich are rich because (through corporations) they get the lion&#8217;s
    share of common wealth; the poor are poor because they get very little.</p>
  <p>Another way to say this is that, just as water flows downhill to the
            sea, so money flows uphill to property. Capitalism by its very design
            maximizes
                returns to existing wealth owners. It benefits, in particular,
        those who own stock when a successful company is young; they can receive
            hundreds, even thousands of times their initial investments when
    the company matures.
                Moreover, once such stockholders accumulate wealth, they can
    increase it
                through reinvestment, pass it on to their heirs, and use their
        inevitable
                influence over politicians to gain extra advantages &#8212; witness
                the steady lowering of taxes on capital gains, dividends, and
                inheritances. On top of
                this, in the last few decades, has been the phenomenon called
                <strong>globalization</strong>. The whole point of globalization is to increase
                the return to capital
                by enabling its owners to find the lowest costs on the planet.
                Hence the stagnation
                at the bottom alongside the surging wealth at the top. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Q: I was at a conference recently on the French concept of &quot;mondialization&quot; as
    opposed to &quot;globalization.&quot; The French consider the spirit of &quot;mondialization&quot; to
    be more &quot;generous&quot; towards less developed countries, in contrast
    to the American idea of pursuing our national interest without regard to
    theirs. Would you call yourself a proponent of &quot;mondialization&quot; rather
    than of &quot;globalization&quot;?</p>
  <p>JES: It is interesting that my book has been selling fantastically in France,
    so they obviously sense the commonality on our views.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Q: From the conference on &quot;mondialization,&quot; I saw a major difference
    in attitude among the French with regard to public investment. The French
    believe strongly in public funds for public works, whereas Americans believe
    they shouldn't be taxed more in order to support public projects. Which view
    do you agree with?</p>
  <p>JES: There's been a lot of so-called &quot;bad rhetoric&quot; in this whole
    area. The real point is that we need to recognize that there are some things
    in the area of &quot;the public sphere.&quot; We're not having investment
    in basic research; we need to have the government do it. And that's what
    I've consistently been arguing; you don't want the government building steel
    factories. But you do want the government doing certain research, and the
    relative size of that depends on the society. Right now, we should be spending
    far more on basic research. So what is the message. I think how much we depend
    on the government. And the new economy, we take it for granted, but it is
    the public sector. I think you're right that we have the wrong view. But
    I keep saying, &quot;The Internet.&quot; How much as it changed our lives?
    And it's [the result of] the government. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>
