  <p><em>Q40. Under the single tax theory what right have you to tax the value
      of &quot;made land,&quot; like the Back Bay of Boston? Is not such land
      produced by labor?</em><br />
A. The surface soil is produced by labor. But the foundation &#8212; the bottom
of a bay, a swamp, a river, or a hole, is not. &quot;Made land&quot; does not
differ economically from a house. Its materials are produced from one place to
another and adjusted to meet the demand. But nature in the case of the &quot;made
land,&quot; as in that of the house, supplies the materials and the foundation.
The value of the Back Bay of Boston is chiefly the value of a location &#8212; a
communal value. The single tax would not take the value of &quot;made land&quot;;
it would take the value of the space where the &quot;made land&quot; is. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

  <p>HE term Land in political economy means the natural or passive element in
    production, and includes the whole external world accessible to man, with
    all its powers, qualities, and products, except perhaps those portions of
    it which are for the time included in man's body or in his products, and
    which therefore temporarily belong to the categories, man and wealth, passing
    again in their reabsorption by nature into the category, land. &#8212; <em>The
    Science of Political Economy &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe314.html">unabridged:
    Book III, Chapter 14: The Production of Wealth, Order of the Three Factors
    of Production</a> &#8226;</em> <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_10.htm">abridged:
    Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production<br>
  </a><br>
THAT land is only a passive factor in production must be carefully kept in mind.
. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who
own land. . . . <br>
  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production
as landowners, and by virtue of that ownership, is as ridiculously impossible
as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</a> </p>
  <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the Bay of
    New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite the point
    where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers, board incoming steamers
    to ask strangers to take their first American swear, and where, if false
    oaths really colored the atmosphere the air would be bluer than is the sky
    on this gracious day. I turn from my writing-machine to the window, and drink
    in, with a pleasure that never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political
  Economy</em> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe406.html">unabridged:
