<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
      bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is the
      way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists, who
      deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics and
    legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
      is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life of
      his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
      it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For
      He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
      that with
      the increase of population and the development of industry the organization
      of human society into states or governments would become both expedient
      and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues. This
      need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry rude
      and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
      and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
      and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
      as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need
      for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained
      need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some way that we
      can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this right way
      of raising
      public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
          of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
          it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing
          men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
          thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the
    fairest division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
          of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
          octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous
          customs duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states;
          the taxes
          on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses,
          on the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can
          these be
          the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
          need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we
          can deem
        a right one?</p>
        <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
          the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the scrupulous;
          they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the price of what
          some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government; they make oaths
          a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and thrift; they lessen
        the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
        <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
        <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
          are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
          that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
        the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
        effects
          in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must buy,
        has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this gospel, which
          holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws of national well-being
          utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory sanctifies national hatreds;
          it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their
          prosperity lies in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions
          they do not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
        of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
        <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
          show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way
        God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
        <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
          a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
          the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any
        exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values
        produced in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The
        value of land
          irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by reason
        of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that always
        goes
          to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the user; for
        if the user be a different person from the owner he must always pay the owner
          for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also the owner,
        it
          is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling or renting
        the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases to be a
        user.</p>
        <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
          of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual what
          belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches to land
          by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the community
        as a whole.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
                are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
                what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
                from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
                for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
                be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
                in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the will
                of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as
                to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
                determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
                the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
                increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
                cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
                or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
                in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in recent
                years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no cost of production,
                since it is created by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is
            fixed &#8212;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
                    by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
                    and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
                    can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br />
              2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
                  particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
                  by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
                  for which no rent is paid; and,<br />
              3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
                  in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
                  social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
              withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
                be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
                the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
                land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
                because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
                economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
                were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
                since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
                of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
                receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
                demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
                to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
                were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult for
                them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not merely
            destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products of
          labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor; to the
          individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would impose no
          burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift; it would
          secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth, by leaving
          men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any artificial
          enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value that cannot
          be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is most easily ascertained
          and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would enormously lessen the number
          of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and
        evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
        <p><strong>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it needs
          by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree of evidence
          that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the nourishment
        of the babe.</strong></p>
        <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
          the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
          but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
          But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
          necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues,
        value begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry
        grows
          more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
          time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
          The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
          since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
          steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
        centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
        Consider
          the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value of
        land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this due?
        Is it
          not due to the density and activity of the populations of those cities &#8212; to
          the very causes that require great public expenditure for streets, drains,
          public buildings, and all the many things needed for the health, convenience
          and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth of such cities
          the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how the opening
          of roads,
          the building of railways, the making of any public improvement, adds to
          the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that
          is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than
          that He
          who ordained the state with its needs has in the values which attach to
        land provided the means to meet those needs? </p>
        <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper
          still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose
          of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law by which
          land values increase with the growth of society not only such a perfectly
          adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual
          perceptions by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose
          with regard to the individual that gratifies our moral perceptions
        by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
        <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one
          thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
          of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
          improvements of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands
          of justice and the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the
          common uses of society. Now, since increase in the fund available for
          the common uses of society is increase in the gain that goes equally
          to each member of society, is it not clear that the law by which land
          values increase with social advance while the value of the products
          of labor does not increase, tends with the advance of civilization
          to make the share that goes equally to each member of society more
          and more important as compared with what goes to him from his individual
          earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen relatively
          the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between the
          strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not
          show the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
          should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and
          greater equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent,
          are making it, an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality?</p>
        <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for
          social needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God
          in the sense that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort
          of men to do things other than in the way he has intended; in the sense
          that where the blessings he proffers to men are refused or misused
          they turn to evils that scourge us. And just as for the mother to withhold
          the provision that fills her breast with the birth of the child is
          to endanger physical health, so for society to refuse to take for social
        uses the provision intended for them is to breed social disease.</p>

  Augustus M Kelley edition (1970), p.xix:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When a child is born, we recognise that it has a natural right to its mother's
      milk, and no one can deny that it has the same right to mother-earth. It is
      really its mother-earth, plus the dew and sunshine from heaven and a little
      labour, that supplies the milk and everything else required for its subsistence.
      The monster that would deprive the babe of its mother's milk, or would monopolise
      the breasts of several mothers, to the exclusion of several children, is not
      more deserving of being destroyed than the monster who seizes absolute possession
      of more than his share of the common mother of mankind, to the exclusion of
      his fellow-creatures.</p>
