</strong></p>
<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
  question.&#8217;</p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. <strong>The role
    of land in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic
    growth
    was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo
    and Malthus.</strong> But the intervening years have seen land slide into
    a more peripheral status within economic analysis. Political economists working
    in the Marxian
    tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as
    the key to understanding the capitalist economy.1 Neo-classical economists
    typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of
    production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists
    have also given little attention to land because typically their analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.

<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the great fund
    intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy the slightest
    tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not only
    do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we see that
    by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the Creator, it
    is impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without at the same
    time adding to the wealth of the world.</p>
  <p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
    in other wrongs. Those who defend private property in land, and thereby deny
    the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right to the
    material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses. Either
    they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindermost,&#8221; deny
    the equal right to life, and by some theory like that to which the English
    clergyman Malthus has given his name, assert that nature (they do not venture
    to say God) brings into the world more men than there is provision for; or,
    they must, as do the socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are
    wrongs. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,

<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    DOES not the fact that all of the things which furnish man's subsistence
      have the power to multiply many fold &#8212; some of them many thousand
      fold, and some of them many million or even billion fold &#8212; while
      he is only doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings increase to
      the full extent of their reproductive power, the increase of population
      can never exceed subsistence? This is clear when it is remembered that
      though in the vegetable and animal kingdoms each species, by virtue of
      its reproductive power, naturally and necessarily presses against the conditions
      which limit its further increase, yet these conditions are nowhere fixed
      and final. No species reaches the ultimate limit of soil, water, air, and
      sunshine; but the actual limit of each is in the existence of other species,
      its rivals, its enemies, or its food. Thus the conditions which limit the
      existence of such of these species as afford him subsistence man can extend
      (in some cases his mere appearance will extend them), and thus the reproductive
      forces of the species which supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves
      against their former limit, start forward in his service at a pace which
      his powers of increase cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds
      will increase: if he but trap foxes the wild rabbits will multiply; the
      bumble bee moves with the pioneer, and on the organic matter with which
      man's presence fills the rivers, fishes feed. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
      II, Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North American
    continent, there would now be no more bears than in the time of Columbus,
    and possibly fewer, for bear food would not have been increased nor the conditions
    of bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the reverse.
    But within the limits of the United States alone, there are now forty-five
    millions of men where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet
    there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five
    millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. It is not the
    increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of
    men that has brought about the increase of food. There is more food, simply
    because there are more Man. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
    Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>TWENTY men working together will, where nature is niggardly, produce more
    than twenty times the wealth that one man can produce where nature is most
    bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the subdivision
    of labor, the greater the economies of production and distribution, and,
    hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the
    limits in which we have any reason to suppose increase would still go on,
    in any given state of civilization a greater number of people can produce
    a larger proportionate amount of wealth and more fully supply their wants,
    than can a smaller number. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
    Chapter 4: Population and Subsistence: Disproof of the Malthusian Theory </p>
  <p> WE talk about the supply of labor, and the demand for labor, but, evidently,
    these are only relative terms. The supply of labor is everywhere the same &#8212; two
    hands always come into the world with one mouth, twenty-one boys to every
    twenty girls; and the demand for labor must always exist as long as men want
    things which labor alone can procure. We talk about the &quot;want of work,&quot; but,
    evidently it is not work that is short while want continues; evidently, the
    supply of labor cannot be too great, nor the demand for labor too small,
    when people suffer for the lack of things that labor produces. The real trouble
    must be that the supply is somehow prevented from satisfying demand, that
    somewhere there is an obstacle which prevents labor from producing the things
    that laborers want.</p>
  <p>Take the case of anyone of these vast masses of unemployed men, to whom,
    though he never heard of Malthus, it today seems that there are too many
    people in the world. In his own wants, in the needs of his anxious wife,
    in the demands for his half cared for, perhaps even hungry and shivering,
    children, there is demand enough for labor, Heaven knows! In his own willing
    hands is the supply. Put him on a solitary island, and though cut off from
    all the enormous advantages which the co-operation, combination, and machinery
    of a civilized community give to the productive powers of man, yet his two
    hands can fill the mouths and keep warm the backs that depend upon them.
    Yet where productive power is at its highest development, he cannot. Why?
    Is it not because in the one case he has access to the material and forces
    of nature, and in the other this access is denied? &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty
