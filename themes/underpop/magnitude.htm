<blockquote>
  <div align="left">Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation
      would provide about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local
      government revenue, which would be more than adequate for government spending
      if it did not include transfer payments. The taxable value of the land in
    the economy would increase over time for two reasons.</div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div align="left">      First, a shift from taxing production to taxing land values would eliminate
                the lost output due to taxes &#8212; about $1 trillion per year.44
            One-fifth of that would be rent, thus increasing rent by $300 billion.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">      Secondly, the economy would grow faster, which also would increase rent over
            time.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div align="left">Tideman et al. (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain
      (measured in real dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land
      as could be financed by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion
      or 14% of NDP in 2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even
      if only a fraction of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes
      we know today to a geo-rent tax, the efficiency gains could be substantial.
      Some critics simply do not believe these results, without bothering to read
    them. I have not seen a rebuttal of Tideman&#8217;s calculation. ... <a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

      of the cost and loss to the city of Boston of the present mixed system
      of taxation
          as compared with the single tax; The computation was made by James
      R. Carret, Esq., the leading conveyancer of Boston:</font></div>

  <div align="left"><font size="-1">But to ascertain the total cost to the people of Boston
          of the present system of taxation for the taxable year, beginning May 1,
          1892, there should be added to the taxes assessed upon them what it cost
          them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the use of the land, being
          the net ground rent, which I estimate at four per cent on the land value.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">Total tax levy, May 1, 1892 ... ... ... ... .... .... ....

  <div align="left"><font size="-1">To contrast this with what the single tax system would have
          cost the people of Boston for that year, take the gross ground rent, found
          by adding to the net ground rent the taxation on land values for that year,
          being $12.90 per $1000, or 1.29 per cent added to 4 per cent = 5.29 per
          cent.</font></div>

        .... .... .... .. ..... ..$9,311,066</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the present
          system and the single tax, for large amounts of real estate are exempt
          from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth, by the
          city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by charitable,
          literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount of the value of
          land so held as returned by the assessors for the year 1892 is $60,626,171.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should
          be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of the public burdens,
          which I cannot take the space to enter into here. There is good reason
          to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed to quite
          an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an indication of
          this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for October
          3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were
          valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report) at $52,712,600.
          I believe that this represents not more than fifty per cent of their true
          market value.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property
          and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think $500,000,000
          to be a fair estimate of the land values of Boston. Making this the basis
          of contrast, we have:</font></div>

          A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per
          cent of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually
          and potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would
          or not is as yet an unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised
          from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while
          any land value remains in private possession. Until land values are exhausted
          the taxation of labor cannot be excused. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

    <div align="left">
        <blockquote>Henry George&#8217;s Solution: Taxing the Flow of Land Rent
          <p>If land values are really the present values of anticipated future ground
            rents, one can certainly treat them as flows rather than stocks, just
            as community services are continuous flows. The amount of rent flowing
            through a site and through the economy is not negligible; what estimates
            have been made, where indeed the economic data allow it to be made, suggest
            that it is roughly a third of a nation&#8217;s GDP.29 The question is
            whether it makes more sense to. Should we elect to continue property
            tax regimes as we do, it would make better sense to tax buildings as
            stocks and lands as rent flows. But this raises the question whether
            real property should be exempt from all taxes, as some have argued.30
            What rationale exists for taxing lands, whether as stocks or flows; and
            why do we tax buildings? I will argue below that taxing buildings and
            the failure to adequately tax land both have deleterious consequences
            for the whole economy.</p>
          <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of
            any sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
            largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century
            or two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior
            to the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially
            in land. American cities today typically record aggregate assessed land
            values &#8211; at least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at
            about 40% to 60% of total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings
            taken together.31 <strong>Skyscrapers reflect enormous capital investment,
            and this expenditure is warranted <em>because of the enormous value of
            locational sites.</em> Each site gets its market price from the fact that the total neighborhood
            context creates an attractive market presence and ambience.</strong> By taxing
            buildings, however, we impose a penalty on their optimum development
            as well as on the incentives for their maintenance. Moreover, taxes on
            buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise be imposed on
            sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and best use
            is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges of properly
            assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly since they
            must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated for potential
            replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with administration
            of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes over the
            valuation of structures, not land values. ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read
