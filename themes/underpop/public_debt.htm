<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. <strong>A
    restriction upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter.</strong> In
    nothing is the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown
    than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this. ...</p>
  <p>To consider what is included in the category of property is to see the absurdity
    of saying that all property should be equally taxed. For not to speak of
    minor differences that arise from application and use, there are commonly
    included under this term things of essentially different nature. Whatever
    is recognized by municipal law as subject to ownership is property. But between
    things thus classed together are wide differences. In the first place, there
    are certain of them which have in themselves no value, but are merely the
    representatives or doubles of property in itself valuable. Such are stocks,
    bonds, mortgages, promissory notes of all kinds, whether made by individuals
    or issued by governments to serve as money, solvent <strong>debts</strong>,
    book-accounts, etc. These things may be to the individual valuable property,
    and are correctly
    included in any estimate of his wealth. But they are no part of the wealth
    of the community. Their increase does not make the community a whit the richer;
    and they may be utterly destroyed without the community becoming a whit the
    poorer. If I buy a horse, giving my note for the amount, the result of the
    transaction (supposing me to be solvent) is that the seller gets property
    to the value of the horse, while I get the horse. But there has been no increase
    in wealth. To the seller, my note may be quite as good as the horse, and
    in estimating his wealth it may be as properly included as the horse; but
    if the note be destroyed, the community is nothing the poorer, while if the
    horse break his neck, there is a lessening of the general wealth by one horse.
    And so, the issuance of bonds by a government, or the watering of stock by
    a corporation, can in no wise increase the general sum of wealth, nor will
    any diminution either in the amount or in the selling price of such bonds
    or stock reduce it. <strong>If all the governments of the world were to repudiate
    their debts tomorrow, an immense amount of property, now carefully guarded,
    would become waste paper, and thousands of people now rich would be made
    poor, but the wealth of the human race would not be diminished one iota. </strong>... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:
Book III, Chapter 17, The Production of Wealth: The Third Factor of Production &#8212; Capital</a> &#8226;<a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_10.htm"> abridged:
Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</a><br>
<br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</a><br>
<br>
THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included
either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which are neither
land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these two original
factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book
I, Chapter 2: Wages and Capital: The Meaning of the Terms</a><br>
<br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book
III, Chapter 4: The Laws of Distribution: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits
Often Mistaken For Interest</a></p>
  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
      <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
    <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book
