<p align="center"><strong>Distribution of Wealth</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This phrase is commonly used to describe how the ownership of specific kinds
      of assets falls across a population. (For example, the Federal Reserve Board's
      triennial Survey of Consumer Finances tells us that the top 1% of the US households
      own
      33.4%
      of
      Net Worth in 2004, up from 30.1% in 1989; the bottom 90% of us hold 30.5%,
      down from 32.8% in 1989. Detail available <a href="../../issues/wealth/90-9-1_Tables.html">here</a>.)</p>
  <p>But for the purposes of wealthandwant.com, &quot;distribution of wealth&quot; also
    has to do with <em>who gets what</em>: what share of the pie does labor get? What
    share
    of the
      pie does the owner of the land get? And that leads to the question of what
      it is legitimate to tap &#8212; to tax &#8212; in order to provide for
      the revenue needs of the community.</p>
  <p>If there is a kind of income which is truly &quot;unearned,&quot; isn't that a legitimate
    tax base?</p>

      <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
      <p>The chart on the following page displays the fundamental principle of
        Production, which we considered at the beginning, and also the fundamental
        principle of Distribution, which is yet to be considered. In the development
        of the latter will be found the explanation of the divorce in the civilized
        state of Labor from Land: [chart]</p>
      <p>        This chart reminds us that Labor (human exertion), by application to
          Land (natural materials and forces external to man), produces Wealth
          (the generic term for all those things that tend to satisfy the material
          Wants of man), and so tends to abolish poverty. No man's poverty can
          be abolished in any other way, unless it be by gifts, or vulgar robbery,
          or legalized spoils.</p>
      <p>The chart shows also that Wealth distributes ultimately in Wages 82
        (a fund made up of the aggregate of the earnings of individual laborers),
        which corresponds to Labor; and Rent 83 (a fund made up of the aggregate
        premiums for specially desirable locations), which corresponds to Land.84</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">82. &quot;What is paid for labor of any kind is called wages. We are
            apt to speak of the payment given to the common day laborer only as wages;
            and we give finer names to the payments which are made for some other
            kinds of services. Thus we speak of the doctor's or the lawyer's fee;
            of the judge's salary; of the teacher's income; of the merchant's profit;
            of the banker's interest, and of the professor's emoluments. They are
            all in reality only payments for labor of different kinds, or for different
            results of labor, &#8212; that is, they are all wages.&quot; &#8212; Dick's
            Outlines, p. 23</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Wages is what goes to pay for all the trouble of labor.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
            Primer, sec. 39</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;His [the manager's] share is called the wages of superintendence,
            and although usually much larger than the share of a common laborer,
            it is really wages of the same nature.&quot; &#8212; Id., sec. 41.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The common meaning of the word wages is the compensation paid
            to a hired person for manual labor. But in political economy the word
            wages has a much wider meaning, and includes all returns for exertion.
            For, as political economists explain, the three agents or factors in
            production are land, labor, and capital, and that part of the produce
            which goes to the second of these factors is styled by them wages. .
            . It is important to keep this in mind. For in the standard economic
            works this sense of the term wages is recognized with greater or less
            clearness only to be subsequently ignored.&quot; &#8212; Progress
            and Poverty, book i, ck. ii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">83. Rent &quot;is what is paid for the use of a natural agent, whether
            land, or beds of minerals, or rivers, or lakes. The rent of a house or
            factory is, therefore, not all rent in our meaning of the word.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
            Primer, sec. 40.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The term rent in its economic sense . . . differs
            in meaning from the word rent as commonly used. In some respects
            this economic
          meaning
            is narrower than the common meaning; in other respects it is wider.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is narrower in this: In common speech, we apply the word rent
            to payments for the use of buildings, machinery, fixtures, etc., as well
            as to payments for the use of land or other natural capabilities; and
            in speaking of the rent of a house or the rent of a farm, we do not separate
            the price for the use of the improvements from the price for the use
            of the bare land. But in the economic meaning of rent, payments for the
            use of any of the products of human exertion are excluded, and of the
            lumped payments for the use of houses, farms, etc., only that part is
            rent which constitutes the consideration for the use of the land &#8212; that
            part paid for the use of buildings or other improvements being properly
            interest, as it is a consideration for the use of capital.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is wider in this: In common speech we only
            speak of rent when owner and user are distinct persons. But in the
            economic sense
          there
            is also rent where the same person is both owner and user. Where
          owner and user are thus the same person, whatever part of his income
          he might
            obtain by letting the land to another is rent, while the return for
          his labor and capital are that part of his income which they would
          yield
            him did he hire instead of owning the land. Rent is also expressed
          in a selling price. When land is purchased, the payment which is made
          for
            the ownership, or right to perpetual use, is rent commuted or capitalized.
            If I buy land for a small price and hold it until I can sell it for
          a large price, I have become rich, not by wages for my labor or by
          interest
            upon my capital, but by the increase of rent.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Rent, in short, is the share in the wealth produced which the
            exclusive right to the use of natural capabilities gives to the owner.
            Wherever land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
            of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or
            hirer, there is rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a
            value, there is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent
            which gives value to land. Until its ownership will confer some advantage,
            land has no value.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iii,
            chap ii</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">84. &quot;The primary division of wealth in distribution is dual, not
            tripartite. Capital is but a form of labor, and its distinction from
            labor is in reality but a subdivision, just as the division of labor
            into skilled and unskilled would be. In our examination we have reached
            the same point as would have been attained had we simply treated capital
            as a form of labor, and sought the law which divides the produce between
            rent and wages; that is to say, between the possessors of the two factors,
            natural substances and powers, and human exertion &#8212; which two factors
            by their union produce all wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
            book iii, ch. v.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Care must be taken not to confuse the hire of a house,
            commonly and legally termed &quot;rent,&quot; with economic Rent.
            House rent is really Wages; it is compensation for the labor of house
            building.
            But economic
            Rent is not compensation for anything; it is simply the premiums
            for advantages of location. ...</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This illustrates the elementary principle of Distribution, that Wages
        fall and Rent rises as demand for land forces labor to land of lower
        productiveness.90 The principle may be more graphically illustrated by
        supposing that demand for spaces in the chart advances so far as to include
        all the closed spaces, except part of the poorest one. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <p>We now find that all Wages have fallen to the level of Wages on the
        poorest land that yields anything to the given unit of labor force; while
        the Rent of all but that has, at the expense of Wages, risen in proportion
        to its superior productiveness.91</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">91. The labor that was forced to the poorest lands would continually
            bid for the opportunities that the better lands offered, until an equilibrium
            was reached at the point shown in the preceding chart, where the given
            expenditure of labor is as well compensated in one place as in another.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">If laborer and land-owner be different persons, the laborer receives
            what is distinguished as Wages, and the land-owner what is distinguished
            as Rent. If the same person, he receives Wages as laborer and Rent as
            land-owner.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Reflection will convince us that this must be so. Wages for a given
        expenditure of labor force are no more anywhere, for any length of time,
        all things considered, than the same expenditure of labor force will
        produce from the best land to be had for nothing. Rent absorbs the difference.92</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">92. But we must not jump to the conclusion that there is any essential
            wrong in Rent. Rent is nature's method of measuring the value of the
            differences in natural opportunity which different laborers, owing to
            variations in land, are obliged to accept. And, what in practice is more
            important, it is nature's method of measuring the value to each individual
            of those advantages which consist in accumulations of common knowledge,
            in co-operative effort, in good government, in a word, in the benefits
            that society as a whole confers as distinguished from those which each
            individual earns. The question is not one of the rightfulness or the
            wrongfulness of Rent. Personal freedom necessitates Rent, for it necessitates
            the private possession of land, and private possession of land makes
            Rent inevitable. Nothing short of communism could abolish it. The real
            question is, What shall society do with Rent? Shall it give it to individuals,
            or use it for common purposes?</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Were there only one man on earth, he would have
            a right to the use of the whole earth.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;When there is more than one man on earth, the right to the use
            of land that any one of them would have, were he alone, is not abrogated;
            it is only limited. . . It has become by reason of this limitation, not
            an absolute right to use any part of the earth, but (1) an absolute right
            to use any part of the earth as to which his use does not conflict with
            the equal rights of others (i. e., which no one else wants to use at
            the same time), and (2) a co-equal right to the use of any part of the
            earth which he and others may want to use at the same time.&quot; &#8212; Perplexed
            Philosopher, p. 45.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1">It is in adjustment of this co-equal right that rent occurs.</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
      <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
        assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more
        productive.93 Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition
        that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
        of labor force as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied
        to the second, to 50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the
        fourth, to 3, and as applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were
        no increased demand for land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon
            the distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways:
            First, By lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing
            out in land special capabilities otherwise latent, and by attaching
            special capabilities to particular lands.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode,
            to which little attention has been given by political economists,
            is really the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
            book iv, ch. iii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks
            off land from those material things which we regard as products of
            the land, we shall find that the fundamental attribute of land is
            its extension. The right to use a piece of land gives command over
            a certain space &#8212; a certain part of the earth's surface. The
            area of the earth is fixed; the geometric relations in which any
            particular part of it stands to other parts are fixed. Man has no
            control over them; they are wholly unaffected by demand; they have
            no cost of production; there is no supply price at which they can
            be produced.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface
            is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it gives him
            room for his own actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the
            light, the air and the rain which nature assigns to that area; and
            it determines his distance from, and in great measure his relations
            to, other things and other persons. We shall find that it is this
            property of land, which, though as yet insufficient prominence has
            been given to it, is the ultimate cause of the distinction which
            all writers are compelled to make between land and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
            Prin., book iv, ch. ii, sec. i.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this
            regular way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are intended
            to illustrate the universal fact that as any land becomes a center
            of trade or other social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
        But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of
        labor increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages
        (as a proportion of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward,
        while that of Rent is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by
        observation. 96</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader,
            before closing this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that
            I am using the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in
            the sense of a proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises,
            I do not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers as
            wages is necessarily less, but that the proportion which it bears
            to the whole produce is necessarily less. The proportion may diminish
            while the quantity remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress
            and Poverty, book iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would
            be the result of social growth if all land but that which was in
            full use were common land. The discovery of mines, the development
            of cities and towns, and the construction of railroads, the irrigation
            of and places, improvements in government, all the infinite conveniences
            and laborsaving devices that civilization generates, would tend to
            abolish poverty by increasing the compensation of labor, and making
            it impossible for any man to be in involuntary idleness, or underpaid,
            so long as mankind was in want. If demand for land increased, Wages
            would tend to fall as the demand brought lower grades of land into
            use; but they would at the same time tend to rise as social growth
            added new capabilities to the lower grades. And it is altogether
            probable that, while progress would lower Wages as a proportion of
            total product, it would increase them as an absolute quantity.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
      <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
        progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if
        Rent be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall
        be steps in the direction of realizing through orderly and natural growth
        those grand conceptions of both the socialist and the individualist,
        which in the present condition of society are justly ranked as Utopian?
        Is it not likewise a plain warning that if Rent be treated as private
        property, advances in productive power will be steps in the direction
        of making slaves of the many laborers, and masters of a few land-owners?
        Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural
        law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly and degrading?
        When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the preceding
        chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth that God
        made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how can a
        contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97 the
        benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
        to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses.

        <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
            settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public
            revenues, and none of the land about him has any value. Another settler
            comes, and another, until a village appears. Some public revenue
            is then required. Not much, but some. And the land has a little value,
            only a little; perhaps just enough to equal the need for public revenue.
            The village becomes a town. More revenues are needed, and land values
            are higher. It becomes a city. The public revenues required are enormous,
            and so are the land values.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
            with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline
            of society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as
            distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand,
            measure the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from
            that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the parts into
            which Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be correct,
            indeed it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and
            to distinguish the two kinds as Communal Earnings and Individual
            Earnings. How, then, can there be any question as to the fund from
            which society should be supported? How can it be justly supported
            in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>

      <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and
        who can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings
        of the community, shall be retained for the support of the community,
        and that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the
        individual in proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine
        law, whether we trace it through complex moral and economic relations,
        or find it in the eighth commandment. </p>

      <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99
        thereby creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society

      <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with
        the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession
        of the best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not
        themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate
        the whole space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest.
        We may distinguish the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated
        without use with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is
        used? Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit
        of future social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system
        of confiscating Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it
        to land-owners who, as such, earn nothing.100</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago
            a workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession
            of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
            the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
            and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest
            court of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right
            of discovery, nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money,
            because the title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land
            upon which it fell.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
        of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
        chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to
        go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much
        will they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use
        and not to hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents
        the full difference between its productiveness and the productiveness
        of the next best. But if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best
        land will soon be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to
        sell or to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land
        of the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently
        land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
      <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
        be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
        of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart
        may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
      <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land
        in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor
        force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that
        it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their
        own pockets as soon as growing demand for land makes it valuable.101
        We may, for illustration, suppose that all the remainder of the second
        space and the whole of the third are thus appropriated, and note the
        effect: [chart]</p>
      <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is
        no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for
        higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning
        lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But
        let more land be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different
        appearance. The new labor must either go to the space that yields but
        1, or buy or rent from owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect
        would be the same in any case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor
        force would get more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners
        as Rent, either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower
        Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical
            or continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But
            actual or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized
            for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling
            value that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
            will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether
            Rent is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will
            be the capitalization of its present or prospective power of producing
            Rent. In fact, much the larger proportion of laud that has a selling
            value is wholly or partly unused, producing no Rent at all, or less
            than it would if fully used. This condition is expressed in the chart
            by the blue color.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial

            including those of collecting the rents, and on the other for its
            mineral wealth, its capabilities of development for any kind of business,
            and its advantages, material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes

            a certain 'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things
            being equal, it will be the higher the more important these direct
            gratifications are, as well as the greater the chance that they and
            the money income afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id.,

        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality
            inhering in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession
            of a thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it
            or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is
            purely relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining
            things for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to
            value, for nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying
            some physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or
            whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves
            the reason of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things
            having some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not
            valuable, as they are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further,
            we may see that with most of the things that have value this difficulty
            or ease of getting them, which determines value, depends on the amount
            of labor which must be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing
            them into the place, form and condition in which they are desired.
            . . Value is simply an expression of the labor required for the production
            of such a thing. But there are some things as to which this is not
            so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective of
            any improvements that labor has made on it, often has value. . .
            Yet a little examination will show that such facts are but exemplifications
            of the general principle, just as the rise of a balloon and the fall
            of a stone both exemplify the universal law of gravitation. . . The
            value of everything produced by labor, from a pound of chalk or a
            paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances of a first-class
            ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the
            labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while the
            value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
            of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of
            the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to
            obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
        Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space,
        but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor
        Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
      <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
        with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
        of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space
        above the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system
        which confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative
        purposes becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they
        would if land were appropriated only for use.</p>
      <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have
        as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before
        (page 73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given
        expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when
        applied to the next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the
        poorest. Labor would not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when
        on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation of land for use only, although
        much less land is actually used. The prizes which expectation of future
        social growth dangles before men as the rewards of owning land, would
        raise demand so as to make it more than ever difficult to get land. All
        of the fourth grade would be taken up in expectation of future demand;
        and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded out to the open space
        that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence of increased
        labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
        yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages
        would then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space.
        Thus: [chart]</p>

              a drink, pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and
              traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point
              where land can be had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry
              or preemption.&quot;</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the
        least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward
        movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall
        below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive
        power may increase, so long as it pays to hold land for higher values.
        Some laborers would continually be pushed back to land which increased
        productive power would have brought up in productiveness from 0 to 1,
        and by perpetual competition for work would so regulate the labor market
        that the given expenditure of labor force, however much it produced,
        could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would
        persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase
        in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without increase
        of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers to
        increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
        again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
        until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
        be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>

        <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political
            Economy,&quot; book ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements
            in agricultural implements which diminish the expense of cultivation,
            that they do not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages
            of his laborers, but that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition
            to the rent already paid to him, all that is saved in the expense
            of cultivation.&quot; This is true not alone of improvements in agriculture,
            but also of improvements in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
            the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies,
            cannot limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a
            fixed quantity, which human agency can neither increase nor diminish;
            but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land, in the minimum
            required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in production.
            If it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were
            reached, it would be possible to continuously increase rent until
            it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently
            reduced below the point at which laborers will consent to work and
            reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital will be
            devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
            advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to
            advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already near
            the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it.
            Yet that there is in all progressive countries a constant tendency
            in the speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit where production
            would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial
            paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>

        Thus increase of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and
        depression of Rent, co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But
        no sooner do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land
        set in, Rent rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly
        reappear. The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent
        higher and Wages lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

            which is the same thing) in all departments of labor and with all
            grades of laborers. This tendency continues until the fictitious
            values of land give way. So long as the tendency is felt only by

        is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
        continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should,
        actually generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase
        of productive power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated,
        tend to even greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues:
        for individuals suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.

      <p>IN the economic meaning of the term production, the transporter or exchanger,
        or anyone engaged in any subdivision of those functions, is as truly
        engaged in production as is the primary extractor or maker. A newspaper-carrier
        or the keeper of a news-stand would, for instance, in common speech be
        styled a distributor. But in economic terminology he is not a distributor
        of wealth, but a producer of wealth. Although his part in the process
        of producing the newspaper to the final receiver comes last, not first,
        he is as much a producer as the paper-maker or type-founder, the editor,
        or compositor, or press-man. For the object of production is the satisfaction
        of human desires, that is to say, it is consumption; and this object
        is not made capable of attainment, that is to say, production is not
        really complete, until wealth is brought to the place where it is to
        be consumed and put at the disposal of him whose desire it is to satisfy.&nbsp; &#8212; <em>The

PRODUCTION and distribution are not separate things, but two mentally distinguishable
parts of one thing &#8212; the exertion of human labor in the satisfaction of
human desire. Though materially distinguishable, they are as closely related
as the two arms of the syphon. And as it is the outflow of water at the longer
end of the syphon that is the cause of the inflow of water at the shorter end,
so it is that distribution is really the cause of production, not production
the cause of distribution. In the ordinary course, things are not distributed
because they have been produced, but are produced in order that they may be distributed.
Thus interference with the distribution of wealth is interference with the production
of wealth, and shows its effect in lessened production. &#8212; <em>The Science

          <br>
OUR inquiry into the laws of the distribution of wealth is not an inquiry into
the municipal laws or human enactments which either here and now, or in any other
time and place, prescribe or have prescribed how wealth shall be divided among
men. With them we have no concern, unless it may be for purposes of illustration.
What we have to seek are those laws of the distribution of wealth which belong
to the natural order &#8212; laws which are a part of that system or arrangement
which constitutes the social organism or body economic, as distinguished from
the body politic or state, the Greater Leviathan which makes its appearance with
civilization and develops with its advance. These natural laws are in all times
and places the same, and though they may be crossed by human enactment, can never
be annulled or swerved by it. It is more needful to call this to mind, because,
in what have passed for systematic treatises on political economy, the fact that
it is with natural laws, not human laws, that the science of political economy
is concerned, has, in treating of the distribution of wealth, been utterly ignored,
and even flatly denied. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe401.html">unabridged:

          </a><br>
THE distinction between the laws of production and the laws of distribution is
not, as is erroneously taught in the scholastic political economy, that the one
set of laws are natural laws and the other human laws. Both sets of laws are
laws of nature. The real distinction is that the natural laws of pro<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>duction
are physical laws and the natural laws of distribution are moral laws. . . .
The moment we turn from a consideration of the laws of the production of wealth
to a consideration of the laws of the distribution of wealth, the idea of ought
or duty becomes primary. All consideration of distribution involves the ethical
principle, is necessarily a consideration of ought or duty &#8212; a consideration
in which the idea of right or justice is from the very first involved. &#8212; <em>The

      <p>THE primary purpose and end of government being to secure the natural
        rights and equal liberty of each, all businesses that involve monopoly
        are within the necessary province of governmental regulation, and businesses
        that are in their nature complete monopolies become properly functions
        of the State. As society develops, the State must assume these functions,
        in their nature co-operative, in order to secure the equal rights and
        liberty of all. That is to say, as, in the process of integration, the
        individual becomes more and more dependent upon and subordinate to the
        all, it becomes necessary for government, which is properly that social
        organ by which alone the whole body of individuals can act, to take upon
        itself, in the interest of all, certain functions which cannot safely
        be left to individuals. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

IT is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to
preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly. Government should be
repressive no further than is necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal
rights of each from aggression on the part of others, and the moment governmental
prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in danger of defeating the very
ends they are intended to serve.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

            </em> <br>
ALL schemes for securing equality in the conditions of men by placing the distribution
of wealth in the hands of government have the fatal defect of beginning at the
wrong end. They pre-suppose pure government; but it is not government that makes
society; it is society that makes government; and until there is something like
substantial equality in the distribution of wealth, we cannot expect pure government. &#8212; <em>Protection

        Catechism
of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
      <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
      <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
      <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
    Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
    and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
    Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
      <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
      <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</p>
      <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
      <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A.<strong> Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</strong></p>
