<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Or, to state the same thing in another way: Land being necessary to life
    and labor, its owners will be able, in return for permission to use it, to
    obtain from mere laborers all that labor can produce, save enough to enable
  such of them to maintain life as are wanted by the landowners and their dependents.</p>
  <p><strong>Thus, where private property in land has divided society into a
      landowning class and a landless class, there is no possible invention or
      improvement,
    whether it be industrial, social or moral, which, so long as it does not
    affect the ownership of land, can prevent poverty or relieve the general
    conditions of mere laborers.</strong> For whether <strong>the effect of any
    invention or improvement</strong>    be to increase what labor can produce or to decrease what is required to
    support the laborer, it can, so soon as it becomes general, result only in
    increasing the income of the owners of land, without at all benefiting the
    mere laborers. In no event can those possessed of the mere ordinary power
    to labor, a power utterly useless without the means necessary to labor, keep
    more of their earnings than enough to enable them to live.</p>
  <p>How true this is we may see in the facts of today. In our own time <strong>invention
    and discovery have enormously increased the productive power of labor, and
    at the same time greatly reduced the cost of many things necessary to the
    support of the laborer. Have these improvements anywhere raised the earnings
    of the mere laborer? Have not their benefits mainly gone to the owners of
    land &#8212; enormously increased land values?</strong></p>
  <p>I say mainly, for some part of the benefit has gone to the cost of monstrous
    standing armies and warlike preparations; to the payment of interest on great
    public debts; and, largely disguised as interest on fictitious capital, to
    the owners of monopolies other than that of land. But improvements that would
    do away with these wastes would not benefit labor; they would simply increase
    the profits of landowners. Were standing armies and all their incidents abolished,
    were all monopolies other than that of land done away with, were governments
    to become models of economy, were the profits of speculators, of middlemen,
    of all sorts of exchangers saved, were every one to become so strictly honest
    that no policemen, no courts, no prisons, no precautions against dishonesty
    would be needed &#8212; the result would not differ from that which has followed
    the increase of productive power.</p>
  <p>Nay, would not these very blessings bring starvation to many of those who
    now manage to live? Is it not true that if there were proposed today, what
    all Christian men ought to pray for, the complete disbandment of all the
    armies of Europe, the greatest fears would be aroused for the consequences
    of throwing on the labor-market so many unemployed laborers?</p>
  <p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
    on every side may be easily seen. <strong>The effect of all inventions and
    improvements that increase productive power, that save waste and economize
    effort, is
    to lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save labor,
    so that we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements. </strong>Now,
    in a natural state of society where the rights of all to the use of the earth
    are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to the very utmost that
    can be imagined without lessening the demand for men, since in such natural
    conditions the demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life and the
    strong instincts that the Creator has implanted in the human breast. But
    in that unnatural state of society where the masses of men are disinherited
    of all but the power to labor when opportunity to labor is given them by
    others, there the demand for them becomes simply the demand for their services
    by those who hold this opportunity, and man himself becomes a commodity.
    Hence, although the natural effect of labor-saving improvement is to increase
    wages, yet in the unnatural condition which private ownership of the land
    begets, the effect, even of such moral improvements as the disbandment of
    armies and the saving of the labor that vice entails, is, by lessening the
    commercial demand, to lower wages and reduce mere laborers to starvation
    or pauperism. If labor-saving inventions and improvements could be carried
    to the very abolition of the necessity for labor, what would be the result?
    Would it not be that landowners could then get all the wealth that the land
    was capable of producing, and would have no need at all for laborers, who
    must then either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
  <p>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long as some
    men are treated as owners of the earth and other men can live on it only
    by their sufferance &#8212; human wisdom can devise no means by which the
    evils of our present condition may be avoided. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font><br>
  </p>
  <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
    this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is
    appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in the natural
    order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation
    owes to its immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, he earned his own
    subsistence by that common labor in which the majority of men must and do
    earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere
    of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual
    truths, receiving its material wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers,
    and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet.
    So, when he chose his disciples, he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
    who live on the labor of others, but to common laboring-men. And when he
    called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral
    and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without condescension on the
    one hand or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such
    labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus
    showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist in what is called
    manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual,
    moral or spiritual fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* Nor should it be forgotten that the investigator, the
        philosopher, the teacher, the artist, the poet, the priest, though not
        engaged in the
      production of wealth, are not only engaged in the production of utilities
      and satisfactions
        to which the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and
      diffusing knowledge, stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral
      sense, may greatly
        increase the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread
      alone. . . . He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate
      of enjoyable
        wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge, or gives to human life
      higher elevation or greater fullness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the
        words, a &#8220;producer,&#8221; a &#8220;working-man,&#8221; a &#8220;laborer,&#8221; and
        is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make
        mankind richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he,
        no matter by what name of honor he may be called, or how lustily the priests
        of Mammon may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but
        a beggar-man or a thief. &#8212; Protection or Free Trade, pp. 74-75.</font></p>

  <p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
    poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute
    to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
    impious violation of his benevolent intention.<strong> In the rudest stage
    of the arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn
    a living.
    With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be possible for all
    to earn much more. </strong>And so, in saying that poverty is no disgrace,
    you convey an unreasonable implication. For poverty ought to be a disgrace,
    since in
    a condition of social justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives
    or unimposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><em>Q39. Why does not labor-saving machinery benefit laborers?</em><br>
    A. Suppose labor-saving machinery to be ideally perfect &#8212; so perfect
    that no more labor is needed. Could that benefit laborers, so long as land
    was owned? Would it not rather make landowners completely independent of
    laborers? Of course it would. Well, the labor-saving machinery that falls
    short of being ideally perfect has the same tendency. The reason that it
    does not benefit laborers is because by enhancing the value of land it restricts
    opportunities for employment. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
