<blockquote>
  <p>WITH profits this inquiry has manifestly nothing to do. We want to find
    what it is that determines the division of their joint produce between land,
    labor, and capital, and profits is not a term that refers exclusively to
    anyone of these three divisions. Of the three parts into which profits are
    divided by political economists &#8212; namely, compensation for risk, wages
    of superintendence, and return for the use of capital &#8212; the latter
    falls under the term interest, which includes all the returns for the use
    of capital, and excludes everything else; wages of superintendence falls
    under the term wages, which includes all returns for human exertion, and
    excludes everything else; and compensation for risk has no place whatever,
    as risk is eliminated when all the transactions of a community are taken
    together.&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp031.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp031.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> INTEREST, as an abstract term in the distribution of wealth, differs in
    meaning from the word as commonly used, in this: That it includes all returns
    for the use of capital, and not merely those that pass from borrower to lender;
    and that it excludes compensation for risk, which forms so great a part of
    what is commonly called interest. Compensation for risk is evidently only
    an equalization of return between different employments of capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html"> &#8212; Book

<blockquote>
  <p>Socially Responsible Corporations<br />
    To survive over time, every organization needs to take in more money than
      it spends. (The only possible exception may be the U.S. government.) This
      means that even nonprofit organizations must, in a sense, make a profit.
      But making a profit isn&#8217;t the same as <em>maximizing</em> profit. In the first
      instance, profit is a means to an end; in the latter, it&#8217;s the purpose
      that trumps all others. Millions of organizations earn enough money to
      stay alive, yet pursue goals other than profit. Is it possible for publicly
      traded corporations to be like that? Can they have <em>multiple</em> bottom lines?
  Can they, in other words, rise above their profit-maximizing algorithm?</p>
  <p>There are several ways this might be possible: enlightened managers might
    choose a higher goal than profit, shareholders might insist on it, and government
    might require it. Let&#8217;s consider each possibility. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This third version of capitalism is a logical successor to the first two.
    In Capitalism 1.0 we had a shortage of goods, in Capitalism 2.0 a surplus.
    In Capitalism 3.0 we&#8217;ll have plenty, but not too much. We&#8217;ll
    have more things we truly need &#8212; healthier ecosystems, communities,
    culture &#8212; and fewer thneeds. We&#8217;ll have a proper balance between
    our &#8220;me&#8221; and our &#8220;we&#8221; sides. We&#8217;ll be more
    connected and less isolated, more secure and less stressed. Overall, I&#8217;d
    venture, we&#8217;ll be happier.</p>
  <p>We&#8217;ll have some new traffic rules on this road. Rights now enjoyed
    exclusively by private capital will be matched, or even trumped, by rights
    held in trust for future generations. Similarly, the ability of private wealth
    owners to receive income and inheritances will be matched by the ability
    of everyone to receive them. And risks we now face individually, such as
    illness, will be tempered by shared risk pools that exclude no one.</p>
  <p>The biggest change will be in the third algorithm I described in chapter
    4: the price of nature will no longer be zero. Instead, the price of nature &#8212; or
    at least, of the scarcest and most endangered parts of nature &#8212; will
    gradually rise. This will compel corporations (and consumers) to internalize
    many of the costs they now externalize.</p>
  <p>This, in turn, will drive them to invest and consume in ways that, over
    time, do less harm to nature. Businesses will invest in clean and renewable
    energy technologies. Farmers will use fewer chemicals, and local food will
    outcompete food grown far away. Consumers will shift from driving alone in
    gas-guzzlers to more convivial forms of transport and less dashing about.
    Housing will move from sprawling suburbs to small towns and tall cities.</p>
  <p>Not everything, however, will change. Winners in the marketplace will still
    enjoy privileges. Government won&#8217;t overregulate our private lives or
    businesses. Nobody&#8217;s private property will be expropriated. Markets
    will remain dynamic.</p>
  <p>And, for businesspeople, here&#8217;s the best part: Capitalism 3.0 will
    preserve the driving force of American capitalism, the profit-maximizing
    algorithm. It will do this not only by leaving the algorithm alone, but also
    by giving all Americans, via the American Permanent Fund, a financial stake
    in its success. All Americans will benefit both from nature&#8217;s health
    and from the health of corporations. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
