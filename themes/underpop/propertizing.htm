    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that nature
  can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private property rights.
  This line of thought is called free market environmentalism, and it&#8217;s
  favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute.</p>
  <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential paper
    by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960, Coase challenged
    the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation is the only way
    to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be protected through property
    rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined and the cost of enforcing
    them is low.</p>
  <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a polluter
    and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance, if the
    polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not to be emitted
    upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will come to a deal that
    reduces pollution.</p>
  <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
    air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid such
    potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a sum of money
    up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation for the inconvenience
    and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree on a level of pollution
    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given free
    to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of pollution
    is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking the opposite
    tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
    Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common property
    and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</p>
  <p>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property rights
          when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by everyone? It turns
    out this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s
    no textbook way to <strong>&#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to
    propertize, I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making
    it ownable.
          Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
          </strong>In fact, there are different ways to <strong>propertize nature,</strong> with
          dramatically different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living
          with these new property rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for
          a long time, it behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires them
    to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example, set
    up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of future
    generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares of Pacific
    Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to preserve the
    forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned some of these rights,
    Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s) would have ended more
    happily.</p>
  <p>Imagine a whole set of property rights like this. Let&#8217;s call them,
    generically, <strong>common property rights</strong>. If such property rights
    didn&#8217;t exist, there&#8217;d be a strong case for inventing them. Fortunately,
    they do exist in a variety of forms &#8212; for example, land or easements
    held in perpetual trust, as by the Nature Conservancy, and corporate assets
    managed on behalf of a broad community, as by the Alaska Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>Some forms of common property include individual shares &#8212; again, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund is an example. These individual shares, however, differ
    from shares in private corporations. They&#8217;re not securities you can
    trade in a market; rather, they depend on your membership in the community.
    If you emigrate or die, you lose your share. Conversely, when you&#8217;re
    born into the community, your share is a birthright.</p>
  <p>I recognize that, for some, turning common wealth into any kind of property
    is a sacrilege. As Chief Seattle of the Suquamish tribe put it, &#8220;How
    can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?&#8221; I empathize deeply
    with this sentiment. However, I&#8217;ve come to believe that it&#8217;s
    more disrespectful of the sky to pollute it without limit or payment than
    to turn it into common property held in trust for future generations. Hence,
    I favor <strong>propertization</strong>, but not privatization. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property.</p>
  <p><strong>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers,
      distinguished between <em>pre</em> distribution of property and <em>re</em> distribution
      of income.</strong> Under income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and
      transferred to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t popular
      with winners, who tend to control government and the media. Under property
      pre distribution, by contrast, the playing field is leveled by spreading
      property ownership before income is generated. After that, there&#8217;s
      no need for income redistribution; property itself distributes income to
      all. According to Rawls, while income <em>re </em>distribution creates
      dependency, property <em>pre</em>distribution empowers.</p>
  <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property from some
    and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth that
    already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing) some of
    that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons, we need
    to propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth now. This twenty-first
    century necessity means we have a chance to save the planet, and as a bonus,
    add a universal birthright. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
