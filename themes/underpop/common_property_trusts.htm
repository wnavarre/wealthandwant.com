<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A trustee isn&#8217;t the same thing as a steward. Stewards care for an
    asset, but their obligations are voluntary and vague. By contrast, trustees&#8217; obligations
    are mandatory and quite specific. Trusteeship is thus a more formal and rigorous
    responsibility than stewardship.</p>
  <p>Trusts can be in charge of financial as well as physical assets. In this
    chapter, my concern is natural assets &#8212; gifts we inherit from creation.
    One of my premises is that each generation has a contract to pass on such
    gifts, undiminished, to those not yet born. If we are to keep this contract,
    someone must act as trustee of nature&#8217;s gifts, or at least of the most
    endangered of them. The question is, who?</p>
  <p>The candidates are government, corporations, and trusts. I argued earlier
    that neither corporations nor government can fulfill this function; they&#8217;re
    both too bound to short-term private interests. That leaves trusts.</p>
  <p>Common Property Trusts</p>
  <p>The Trebah Garden Trust isn&#8217;t a rarity. Across Britain, the National
    Trust &#8212; a nongovernmental charity founded in 1895 &#8212; owns over
    six hundred thousand acres of countryside, six hundred miles of coastline,
    and two hundred historic buildings and gardens. It has over three million
    members who elect half of its fifty-two-person governing council (the other
    half are appointed by nonprofit organizations that share the trust&#8217;s
    goals). In the United States, there are now over fifteen hundred Trebah-like
    trusts, protecting over nine million acres. On top of that, the fifty-five-year-old
    Nature Conservancy protects more than fifteen million acres.</p>
  <p>Let&#8217;s posit, then, a generic institution, the common property trust.
    It&#8217;s a special kind of trust that manages assets that come from the
    commons and are meant to be preserved as commons. Common property trusts
    manage these assets first and foremost on behalf of future generations. They
    may have secondary beneficiaries, such as public education or residents of
    a particular locale, but such living beneficiaries take backseats to the
    yet-to-be-born. These trusts carry out their missions by owning and managing
    bundles of property rights. Here are two examples from my own backyard: the
    Marin Agricultural Land Trust (MALT) and the Pacific Forest Trust (PFT).
    The demise of family farms and the loss of open space around cities are seemingly
    unstoppable trends. Yet in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, family-owned
    dairy, sheep, and cattle ranches have survived. A big reason is that ranchers
    there have an option: selling conservation easements to MALT.</p>
  <p>A conservation easement is a voluntary agreement between a landowner and
    a trust that permanently limits uses of the land. The owner continues to
    own and use the land and may sell it or pass it on to her heirs. However,
    the owner gives up some of the rights associated with the land &#8212; for
    example, the right to build additional houses on it or to clear-cut trees.
    The trust that acquires the easement makes sure its terms are followed by
    the current as well as future owners.</p>
  <p>In Marin County, MALT has preserved nearly forty thousand acres of farmland
    by buying conservation easements from ranchers. This represents about a third
    of the land currently farmed. The ranchers receive the difference between
    what the land would be worth if developed and what it&#8217;s worth as a
    working farm. In effect, they&#8217;re paid to be land stewards and to forgo
    future capital gains.</p>
  <p>Most of MALT&#8217;s money comes from public sources. What the public receives
    isn&#8217;t an old-fashioned commons of shared pasturage, but a lasting pastoral
    landscape and a viable agricultural economy. That&#8217;s not a bad alternative
    to suburban sprawl.</p>
  <p>In much the same way, the Pacific Forest Trust acquires what it calls working
    forest conservation easements from private woodlands owners. Some of the
    easements are purchased, others are donated by owners in exchange for tax
    benefits. Here again, owners keep their land but agree to forgo nonforest
    development and to harvest trees sustainably.</p>
  <p>PFT&#8217;s goal is to protect not only forests themselves but the many
                  species that live in them, as well as the ecosystem services &#8212; such
                  as clean water and carbon absorption &#8212; that forests provide.
                  As with MALT, some of PFT&#8217;s money comes from public sources.
                  In return, the public gets healthy forests for considerably
                  less
                  than it would
                  cost to buy
                  and manage them outright. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p><br>
    Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
    through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common property?
    One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted earlier, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to invest in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments pays yearly dividends
    to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended to any state or nation,
    whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent
    Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The
    reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of the
    population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</p>
  <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
  <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
    worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would pay
    equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell, so
    would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all boats.
    America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
