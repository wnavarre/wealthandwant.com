<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>film: White Cliffs of Dover </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>How do the landed gentry support themselves? They collect rent from their
                      tenants. They don't need to work as much as others; they
    can devote themselves to philanthropy, to managing their property, the largest
    part of which is not buildings but land or site value. The phrase may
    conjure up images of gentleman farmers, but the far more important version
    is the urban
    landed
    gentry.
    And
    by that
    I don't mean
                      the folks associated with gentrification, who may buy homes
    for themselves in deteriorated neighborhoods and fix them up to live in themselves,
    perhaps renting out some excess space. No, today's most significant
                      landed gentry are the individuals,  corporate shareholders,
    S-corp partners, REIT holders, trust beneficiaries, etc., who own chunks
    of urban land. A tiny lot
    in Harlem
    can
                      be worth $1,000,000. An acre in midtown Manhattan can be
    worth $1 billion (yes, that's billion with a B! &#8212; that's $23,000 per
    square foot!) and it is increasing in value quite
    rapidly. </p>
  <p>We tax them rather lightly. The city values their land at a tiny fraction
      of its market value. Then it places a very small annual tax on that amount.
      The federal government allows depreciation, and while property-owners are not
      supposed to depreciate land, they do, and in fact the same land gets depreciated
      over and over by a series of owners, while it is <em>appreciating</em> by large jumps.
      And that appreciation is not created by anything the landholder does, but by
      the presence of the community and by the taxpayers' spending on infrastructure
      and services.</p>
  <p>Leona Helmsley and Brooke Astor, who died within a month of each other in
      2007, both lived on fortunes made in New York real estate. Much of
    that was land rent,
      capitalized into increasingly high prices on land. The little people paid
    for that. The people who pay taxes &#8212; wage taxes, sales taxes, income
    taxes, taxes on their homes, etc. The people who pay mortgages &#8212; who
    pay not only the principal which went to the seller (who didn't create the
    land value
      either) and also pay interest to the lender &#8212; and then must pay taxes
      to pay for the services. The people who don't own any property, but pay
      rent to their landlords (residential and commercial) and then pay sales
      taxes and
      other taxes to provide the very services which allow their landlord to
      charge them higher rent next year!</p>
  <p><strong>Land value taxation</strong> would collect for the community the value that the community
      created. Far more effective than a once-a-generation tax on estates, or even
      a transaction tax. Far more just than paying for infrastructure and services
      through sales taxes, wage taxes, building taxes, etc.</p>
  <p>Should the sons and daughters of those who collected a lot of land be entitled
      to more than the sons and daughters of their tenants? Should they be able
    to pocket the <em>land</em> rent &#8212; or should
    we be collecting that land rent as our common treasure, the rightful taxbase?</p>
  <p>When a well-located neighborhood of obsolete buildings is &quot;discovered&quot; by
      people with higher income and a need for housing, the result is sometimes
    referred to as &quot;gentrification.&quot; It is a form of sprawl; as transportation
    improves, or prices become too high for some in the closer-in neighborhoods,
    those with both housing needs and income will move in.</p>

      <p><br>
THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

      <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values
        as the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions.
        A land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
        enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign
        of William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the
        pound. With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which
        men would naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up
        the question of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to
        propose the substitution of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably
        end in a demand for the restoration to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection

          <br>
  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
      <p><strong>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long
          Parliament, ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply
          an appropriation
        of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the
        consideration on which they held the common property of the nation, and
        saddled it on the people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has
        been long characterized, and is still held up in the law books, as a
        triumph of the spirit of freedom. Yet here is the source of the immense
        debt and heavy taxation of England. </strong>Had the form of these feudal dues
        been simply changed into one better adapted to the changed times, English
        wars need never have occasioned the incurring of debt to the amount of
        a single pound, and the labor and capital of England need not have been
        taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military establishment.
        All this would have come from rent, which the landholders since that
        time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which land
        ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
        of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
        population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
        perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various
        fines and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent.
        It would probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these
        various services and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had
        the landholders been kept to this contract and no land been permitted
        to be inclosed except upon similar terms, the income accruing to the
        nation from English land would today be greater by many millions than
        the entire public revenues of the United Kingdom. England today might
        have enjoyed absolute free trade. There need not have been a customs
        duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet all the present expenditures
        could be met, and a large surplus remain to be devoted to any purpose
        which would conduce to the comfort or well-being of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

      <p>WHAT the people of England are entitled to by natural right, and what
        we propose by the single tax to take for their use, is the value of land <span style="font-style: italic;">as
        it is</span>, exclusive of the value or improvements <span style="font-style: italic;">as
        they are</span> in or on the land privately owned. What would thus be
        left to the landowners would be their personal or moveable property,
        the value of all existing improvements in or on their land, and their
        equal share with all other citizens in the land value resumed. This is
        perfectly clear, and if not perfectly fair, is only so because it would
        leave to the landowners in their personal property and the value of their
        improvements much not due to any exertion of labor by themselves or their
        ancestors, but which has come to them through the unjust appropriation
        of the proceeds of others' labor. &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/APP/PIII_C08_Justice_on_the_Right_to_Land.htm">A
