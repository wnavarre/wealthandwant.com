<p align="center"><strong><em>Ad Valorem</em> Taxes
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">Land Taxation and Efficient
    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Taxes on the
    Sale Value of Land</b></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A tax on the sale value of land, or "</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ad
      valorem</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">" tax, is a recurring (e.g., annual or monthly) tax
      proportional to the price at which the land would sell.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ad
      valorem</span> taxes on land have been praised by many economists for the
      fact that they do not impair incentives to use land productively. The characteristic
      of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax that keeps it from impairing incentives to
      produce is that, when such a tax is properly administered, the amount of
      the tax is independent of any action taken by the taxpayer. Whatever course
      of action maximizes the wealth of a taxpayer before a tax is levied also
      maximizes his or her wealth after the tax is levied (apart from income effects,
      which do not entail allocative distortions). A taxpayer can reduce the taxes
      he or she pays by selling the land, but the new purchaser will acquire a
      tax burden of the same magnitude. The total of taxes to be paid is independent
      of any reshuffling of land titles among taxpayers. For this reason, <em>ad
      valorem</em> taxes on land, like taxes on the rental value of land, are capitalized
      into the purchase price of land and entail no economic distortions.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A tax on the sale value of land is very much
      like a tax on the rental value of land, but with a somewhat different incidence. </span>If
      land is not taxed, its sale value in a market in which the participants foresee
      the same opportunities can be described as the present value of future net
      returns, discounted at the market interest rate, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">r</span>,
      when the land is used in such a way as to maximize those returns. The effect
      of an ad valorem tax at an annual rate of <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">t</span> is to increase the annual
      holding cost of a dollar's worth of land from r to r + t. Thus the value
      of a site in the presence of a tax at a rate of t is computed by discounting
      future returns at a rate of r + t. The sale price of a site with a net return
      of x per year falls from x/r to x/(r + t), so the tax takes the fraction
      t/(r + t) of the pre-tax value. Thus for land that is not changing in value,
      an ad valorem tax at a rate of t is equivalent to a tax at a rate of t/(r
      + t) on the rental value of the land.</p>
  <p>If the net return from the use of a site is not constant but rather grows
    from an initial value of x at a rate of g, then the sale value of the site
    in the absence of a tax is x/(r - g). When the tax raises the annual holding
    cost to r + t, the sale price becomes x/(r + t - g). The fraction of value
    that is taken by the tax is t/(r + t - g). For example, if the tax rate is
    4% and the interest rate is 8%, then the tax takes 1/3 of the value of a site
    that is not growing, but 40% of the value of a site whose return is growing
    at 2% per year. When paths of returns through time cannot be expressed as simple
    growth rates, it continues to be true that, other things being equal, a site
    with relatively more attractive future prospects will bear a higher proportion
    of current taxes under a tax on the sale value of land than under a tax on
    the rental value of land. Thus an ad valorem tax falls more heavily on land
    that might be the object of speculation than on other land. It thus tends to
    discourage speculation more than a tax on the rental value of land does. Otherwise,
    its effects are the same as those of a tax on the rental value of land. There
    is an upper limit of 100% on the feasible rate of a tax on the rental value
    of land. There is no such upper limit on the feasible rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax
    on land. The tax could be 10% per year or 10% per day or 10% per hour, with
    the sale value falling as the rate rose. In the limit as the tax rate of an <em>ad
    valorem </em>tax approaches infinity, the tax approaches a tax that takes 100%
    of the rental value of the land.</p>
  <p>An <em>ad valorem</em> tax is administered by having assessors who estimate
    the sale value of land. When tax rates are modest, it is easy enough for assessors
    to do this by monitoring sales of land that is vacant or has only structures
    that are about to be demolished. However, if the rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax
    is very high, then the influence of inherent value of land will be overwhelmed
    in prices by idiosyncratic features of transactions between particular buyers
    and sellers. Assessors would need to rely on processes in which sale prices
    were linked directly to taxes. These could be either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">auctions</span>, where participants knew that the
    auction result would be used to set the tax for a specified period, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">options</span>,
    where potential uses of land offered specified payments for any site meeting
    certain standards. Because <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on land have no distorting
    effects, they neither retard nor advance the timing of land development in
    a world of perfect information. This has been denied by Shoup (1970, p. 38-39),
    Bentick (1979, pp. 861-63; 1982) and a variety of other writers who have followed
    them. The tax that Shoup and Bentick analyze, however, is not an <em>ad valorem</em> tax,
    but rather a tax whose base is the present value of the future net income that
    is expected to result from the plans for a site. Thus a change in the plan
    produces a change in the tax bill, generating an incentive for inefficient
    changes in plans (Tideman, 1982). ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
