<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[07] </span>Thus the mere growth  of society involves danger of the gradual conversion of government into  something independent of and beyond the people, and the gradual seizure  of its powers by a ruling class &mdash; though not necessarily a class marked  off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history shows,  personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the  concentration of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a  little town where each knows his neighbor and matters of common  interest are under the common eye, enable the citizens freely to govern  themselves, may, in a great city, as we have in many cases seen, enable  an organized ring of plunderers to gain and hold the government. So,  too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the  growth of the country and the greater number of interests make the  proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents  know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and  judicial departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the  people.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="style1">[08] </span>But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the  changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of  steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the  concentration of wealth and power. <strong>Workmen are becoming massed by  hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;  small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen  of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues  and pay-rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this  concentration grows the facility of combination among these great  business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal  operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers, combine,  either to regulate prices or to use the powers of government! </strong>The  tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation of rings  against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served. <a href="../../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>

  3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Trebah Garden is a spectacular piece of paradise in Cornwall, England, a
    ravine with a huge variety of trees and shrubs that winds its way down to
    a beach on the Helford River. Several years ago I visited this garden to
    enjoy its beauty. I soon learned that its history and governance are as interesting
    as its flora.</p>
  <p>The property is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as belonging
    to the Bishop of Exeter. It passed through the hands of many squires and
    farmers until it was acquired in 1831 by a wealthy Quaker family, which developed
    the extraordinary garden. In the twentieth century the property changed hands
    several more times and the garden gradually deteriorated. The last private
    owners sank a small fortune into restoring the garden, then donated it to
    the Trebah Garden Trust, so it could be opened to the public and preserved
    for future generations.</p>
  <p>Today, anyone can become a lifetime member of this trust by making a donation
    of &pound;250. Members get free access to the garden (other visitors pay
    an admission fee) and elect a council to manage the property. They receive
    an annual report, audited accounts, and notices of meetings at which they
    may vote and submit resolutions. At present, there are about a thousand voting
    members of the trust.</p>
  <p>As I wandered through the acres of ferns and rhododendrons, it struck me
    that Trebah is a microcosm for the ideas in this book. It has passed from
    private ownership to a form of common ownership that enables it to be shared
    and preserved. If we think of the world as an assemblage of gardens &#8212; that
    is, of ecosystems in which humans play active roles &#8212; the Trebah model
    becomes extremely interesting. It illuminates both a process by which natural
    gifts can shift from private to common ownership, and an institutional model &#8212; the
    trust &#8212; for managing such gifts as permanent parts of the commons.</p>
  <p>Trusts are centuries-old institutions devised to hold and manage property
    for beneficiaries. The essence of a trust is a fiduciary relationship. Neither
    trusts nor their trustees may ever act in their own self-interest; they&#8217;re
    legally obligated to act solely on behalf of beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Trusts are bound by numerous rules, including the following:</p>
  <p> * Managers must act with undivided loyalty to beneficiaries.<br>
  * Unless authorized to act otherwise, managers must preserve the corpus of
    the trust. It&#8217;s okay to spend income, but not to diminish principal.<br>
  * Managers must ensure transparency by making timely financial information
  available to beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>These rules are enforceable. The basic enforcement mechanism is that an
    aggrieved beneficiary or a state attorney general can bring suit against
    a trustee. When that happens, the trustee must prove she acted prudently;
    if there&#8217;s any doubt, the trustee is fined or fired. As Supreme Court
    Justice Benjamin Cardozo once put it: &#8220;A trustee is held to something
    stricter than the morals of the marketplace. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio
    of an honor the most sensitive, is the standard of behavior.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A trustee isn&#8217;t the same thing as a steward. Stewards care for an
    asset, but their obligations are voluntary and vague. By contrast, trustees&#8217; obligations
    are mandatory and quite specific. Trusteeship is thus a more formal and rigorous
    responsibility than stewardship.</p>
  <p>Trusts can be in charge of financial as well as physical assets. In this
    chapter, my concern is natural assets &#8212; gifts we inherit from creation.
    One of my premises is that each generation has a contract to pass on such
    gifts, undiminished, to those not yet born. If we are to keep this contract,
    someone must act as trustee of nature&#8217;s gifts, or at least of the most
    endangered of them. The question is, who?</p>
  <p>The candidates are government, corporations, and trusts. I argued earlier
    that neither corporations nor government can fulfill this function; they&#8217;re
    both too bound to short-term private interests. That leaves trusts. ...</p>

  <p>Common Property Trusts</p>
  <p>The Trebah Garden Trust isn&#8217;t a rarity. Across Britain, the National
    Trust &#8212; a nongovernmental charity founded in 1895 &#8212; owns over
    six hundred thousand acres of countryside, six hundred miles of coastline,
    and two hundred historic buildings and gardens. It has over three million
    members who elect half of its fifty-two-person governing council (the other
    half are appointed by nonprofit organizations that share the trust&#8217;s
    goals). In the United States, there are now over fifteen hundred Trebah-like
    trusts, protecting over nine million acres. On top of that, the fifty-five-year-old
    Nature Conservancy protects more than fifteen million acres.</p>
  <p>Let&#8217;s posit, then, a generic institution, the common property trust.
    It&#8217;s a special kind of trust that manages assets that come from the
    commons and are meant to be preserved as commons. Common property trusts
    manage these assets first and foremost on behalf of future generations. They
    may have secondary beneficiaries, such as public education or residents of
    a particular locale, but such living beneficiaries take backseats to the
    yet-to-be-born. These trusts carry out their missions by owning and managing
    bundles of property rights. Here are two examples from my own backyard: the
    Marin Agricultural Land Trust (MALT) and the Pacific Forest Trust (PFT).
    The demise of family farms and the loss of open space around cities are seemingly
    unstoppable trends. Yet in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, family-owned
    dairy, sheep, and cattle ranches have survived. A big reason is that ranchers
    there have an option: selling conservation easements to MALT.</p>
  <p>A conservation easement is a voluntary agreement between a landowner and
    a trust that permanently limits uses of the land. The owner continues to
    own and use the land and may sell it or pass it on to her heirs. However,
    the owner gives up some of the rights associated with the land &#8212; for
    example, the right to build additional houses on it or to clear-cut trees.
    The trust that acquires the easement makes sure its terms are followed by
    the current as well as future owners.</p>
  <p>In Marin County, MALT has preserved nearly forty thousand
                          acres of farmland by buying conservation easements
                      from ranchers. This represents
                                  about
                                      a third of the land currently farmed. The
                      ranchers receive the difference between
                                        what the land would be worth if developed
                        and what
                            it&#8217;s worth as a
                                        working farm. In effect, they&#8217;re
                                        paid to be land stewards and to forgo
                                        future capital
                                        gains.</p>
  <p>Most of MALT&#8217;s money comes from public sources. What the public receives
    isn&#8217;t an old-fashioned commons of shared pasturage, but a lasting pastoral
    landscape and a viable agricultural economy. That&#8217;s not a bad alternative
    to suburban sprawl.</p>
  <p>In much the same way, the Pacific Forest Trust acquires what it calls working
    forest conservation easements from private woodlands owners. Some of the
    easements are purchased, others are donated by owners in exchange for tax
    benefits. Here again, owners keep their land but agree to forgo nonforest
    development and to harvest trees sustainably.</p>
  <p>PFT&#8217;s goal is to protect not only forests themselves but the many
    species that live in them, as well as the ecosystem services &#8212; such
    as clean water and carbon absorption &#8212; that forests provide. As with
    MALT, some of PFT&#8217;s money comes from public sources. In return, the
    public gets healthy forests for considerably less than it would cost to buy
    and manage them outright. <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
