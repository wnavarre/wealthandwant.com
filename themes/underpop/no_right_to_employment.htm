      <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
          of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
          Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>    To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
      in other wrongs. Those who defend private property in land, and thereby
      deny the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right
      to the material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses.
      Either they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindermost,&#8221; deny
      the equal right to life, and by some theory like that to which the English
      clergyman Malthus has given his name, assert that nature (they do not venture
      to say God) brings into the world more men than there is provision for;
      or, they must, as do the socialists, assert as rights what in themselves
      are wrongs.</p>
        <p>Your Holiness in the Encyclical gives an example of this. <strong>Denying
          the equality of right to the material basis of life, and yet conscious
          that there is a right to live, you assert the right of laborers to
          employment and their right to receive from their employers a certain
          indefinite wage. No such rights exist. No one has a right to demand
          employment of another, or to demand higher wages than the other is
          willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another to make him
          raise such wages against his will. </strong>There can be no better moral justification
          for such demands on employers by working-men than there would be for
          employers demanding that working-men shall be compelled to work for
          them when they do not want to and to accept wages lower than they are
          willing to take. Any seeming justification springs from a prior wrong,
          the denial to working-men of their natural rights, and can in the last
          analysis rest only on that supreme dictate of self-preservation that
          under extraordinary circumstances makes pardonable what in itself is
          theft, or sacrilege or even murder.</p>
        <p>A fugitive slave with the bloodhounds of his pursuers baying at his
          heels would in true Christian morals be held blameless if he seized
          the first horse he came across, even though to take it he had to knock
          down the rider. But this is not to justify horse-stealing as an ordinary
          means of traveling.</p>
        <p>When his disciples were hungry Christ permitted them to pluck corn
          on the Sabbath day. But he never denied the sanctity of the Sabbath
          by asserting that it was under ordinary circumstances a proper time
          to gather corn.</p>
        <p>He justified David, who when pressed by hunger committed what ordinarily
          would be sacrilege, by taking from the temple the loaves of proposition.
          But in this he was far from saying that the robbing of temples was
          a proper way of getting a living.</p>
        <p>In the Encyclical however you commend the application to the ordinary
          relations of life, under normal conditions, of principles that in ethics
          are only to be tolerated under extraordinary conditions. You are driven
          to this assertion of false rights by your denial of true rights. The
          natural right which each man has is not that of demanding employment
          or wages from another man; but that of employing himself &#8212; that
          of applying by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which
          the Creator has in the land provided for all men. <strong>Were that storehouse
          open, as by the single tax we would open it, the natural demand for
          labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold labor and the
          man who bought it would become free exchangers for mutual advantage,
          and all cause for dispute between workman and employer would be gone.
          For then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity
          to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for
          another for less, all things considered, than he could earn by working
          for himself, wages would necessarily rise to their full value, and
          the relations of workman and employer be regulated by mutual interest
          and convenience.</strong></p>
        <p>This is the only way in which they can be satisfactorily regulated.</p>
        <p>Your Holiness seems to assume that there is some just rate of wages
          that employers ought to be willing to pay and that laborers should
          be content to receive, and to imagine that if this were secured there
          would be an end of strife. This rate you evidently think of as that
          which will give working-men a frugal living, and perhaps enable them
          by hard work and strict economy to lay by a little something.</p>
        <p>But how can a just rate of wages be fixed without the &#8220;higgling
          of the market&#8221; any more than the just price of corn or pigs or
          ships or paintings can be so fixed? And would not arbitrary regulation
          in the one case as in the other check that interplay that most effectively
          promotes the economical adjustment of productive forces? Why should
          buyers of labor, any more than buyers of commodities, be called on
          to pay higher prices than in a free market they are compelled to pay?
          Why should the sellers of labor be content with anything less than
          in a free market they can obtain? Why should working-men be content
          with frugal fare when the world is so rich? Why should they be satisfied
          with a lifetime of toil and stinting, when the world is so beautiful?
          Why should not they also desire to gratify the higher instincts, the
          finer tastes? Why should they be forever content to travel in the steerage
          when others find the cabin more enjoyable? ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read
