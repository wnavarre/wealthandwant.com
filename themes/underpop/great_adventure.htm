<blockquote>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is wrecking
    modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry George, and
    he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole take
    the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able to hold
    land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could have
  land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social ends.</p>
  <p>A few years ago, out here in Southern California, a fine enthusiast by the
    name of <a href="../../docs/North_SotGA.htm">Luke North</a> started what he called the &quot;Great Adventure&quot; movement,
    to carry California for the Single Tax. I did what I could to help, and in
    the course of the campaign discovered what I believe is the weakness of the
    Single Tax movement. Our opponents, the great rich bankers and land speculators
    of California, persuaded the poor man that we were going to put all taxes on
    this poor man's lot, and to let the rich man's stocks and bonds, his inheritance,
    his wife's jewels, and all his income, escape taxation. The poor man swallowed
    this argument, and the &quot;Great Adventure&quot; did not carry California.</p>
  <p>So, I no longer advocate the Single Tax. I advocate many taxes. I want to
    tax the rich man's stocks and bonds, also his income, and his inheritances,
    and his wife's jewels. In addition, I advocate a land tax, but one graduated
    like the income tax. If a man or a corporation owns a great deal of land, I
    want to tax him on the full rental value. If he owns only one little lot, I
    don't want to tax him at all. Some day that measure will come before the voters
    of California, and then I should like to see the bankers and land speculators
    of the state persuade the poor man that the measure would not be to the poor
    man's advantage! ... ... <a href="../../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>
