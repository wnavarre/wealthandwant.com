<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have said enough to show your Holiness the injustice into which you fall
    in classing us, who in seeking virtually to abolish private property in land
    seek more fully to secure the true rights of property, with those whom you
    speak of as socialists, who wish to make all property common. But you also
    do injustice to the socialists.<br />
    <br />
    There are many, it is true, who feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of
    the present distribution of wealth are animated only by a blind hatred of
    the rich and a fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments. This
    class is indeed only less dangerous than those who proclaim that no social
    improvement is needed or is possible. But it is not fair to confound with
  them those who, however mistakenly, propose definite schemes of remedy.</p>
  <p>The socialists, as I understand them, and as the term has come to apply
    to anything like a definite theory and not to be vaguely and improperly used
    to include all who desire social improvement, do not, as you imply, seek
    the abolition of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
    communists. What the socialists seek is the state assumption of capital (in
    which they vaguely and erroneously include land), or more properly speaking,
    of large capitals, and state management and direction of at least the larger
    operations of industry. In this way they hope to abolish interest, which
    they regard as a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers,
    speculators, contractors and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do
    away with the wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent
    competition, which they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment
    of labor. The more moderate of them, without going so far, go in the same
    direction, and seek some remedy or palliation of the worst forms of poverty
    by government regulation. The essential character of socialism is that it
    looks to the extension of the functions of the state for the remedy of social
    evils; that it would substitute regulation and direction for competition;
    and intelligent control by organized society for the free play of individual
    desire and effort.</p>
  <p>Though not usually classed as socialists, both the trades-unionists and
    the protectionists have the same essential character. The trades-unionists
    seek the increase of wages, the reduction of working-hours and the general
    improvement in the condition of wage-workers, by organizing them into guilds
    or associations which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their labor;
    shall deal as one body with employers in case of dispute; shall use on occasion
    their necessary weapon, the strike; and shall accumulate funds for such purposes
    and for the purpose of assisting members when on a strike, or (sometimes)
    when out of employment. The protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions
    or taxes on imports to regulate the industry and control the exchanges of
    each country, so as, they imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent
    the competition of people of other countries.</p>
  <p>At the opposite extreme are the <strong>anarchists</strong>, a term which, though frequently
    applied to mere violent destructionists, refers also to those who, seeing
    the many evils of too much government, regard government in itself as evil,
    and believe that in the absence of coercive power the mutual interests of
    men would secure voluntarily what cooperation is needed.</p>
  <p>Differing from all these are those for whom I would speak. Believing that
    the rights of true property are sacred, we would regard forcible communism
    as robbery that would bring destruction. But we would not be disposed to
    deny that voluntary communism might be the highest possible state of which
    men can conceive. Nor do we say that it cannot be possible for mankind to
    attain it, since among the early Christians and among the religious orders
    of the Catholic Church we have examples of communistic societies on a small
    scale. St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Thomas of Aquin and Fra Angelico, the
    illustrious orders of the Carmelites and Franciscans, the Jesuits, whose
    heroism carried the cross among the most savage tribes of American forests,
    the societies that wherever your communion is known have deemed no work of
    mercy too dangerous or too repellent &#8212; were or are communists. Knowing
    these things we cannot take it on ourselves to say that a social condition
    may not be possible in which an all-embracing love shall have taken the place
    of all other motives. But we see that communism is only possible where there
    exists a general and intense religious faith, and we see that such a state
    can be reached only through a state of justice. For before a man can be a
    saint he must first be an honest man.</p>
  <p><strong>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better
      term have come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ.
      We regard them
    as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social nature
    of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature.</strong> While we see that man
    is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or can come
    from the interference by the state with things that belong to individual
    action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him,
    a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social advance, having
    an indispensable place in the natural order. Looking on the bodily organism
    as the analogue of the social organism, and on the proper functions of the
    state as akin to those that in the human organism are discharged by the conscious
    intelligence, while the play of individual impulse and interest performs
    functions akin to those discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious
    instincts and involuntary motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who
    would try to get along without heads and the socialists like men who would
    try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of their
    frames by conscious will.</p>
  <p><strong>The philosophical anarchists of whom I speak are few in number, and of little
    practical importance. It is with socialism in its various phases that we
  have to do battle.</strong>... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Poverty is widespread and pitiable. This we know. Its general manifestations
    are so common that even good men look upon it as a providential provision
    for enabling the rich to drive camels through needles' eyes by exercising
    the modern virtue of organized giving.32 Its occasional manifestations in
    recurring periods of &quot;hard times&quot;33 are like epidemics of a virulent
    disease, which excite even the most contented to ask if they may not be the
    next victims. Its spasms of violence threaten society with anarchy on the
    one hand, and, through panic-stricken efforts at restraint, with loss of
    liberty on the other. And it persists and deepens despite the continuous
  increase of wealth producing power.34</p>
