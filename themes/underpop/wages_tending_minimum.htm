<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
    of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and on which
    he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not irresistibly follow
    that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others all
    right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged
    and the helpless? Does it not follow that those who have no rights to the
    use of land can live only by selling their power to labor to those who own
    the land? <strong>Does it not follow that what the socialists call &#8220;the iron
    law of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency
    of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless masses &#8212; the
    mere laborers, who of themselves have no power to use their labor &#8212; all
    the benefits of any possible advance or improvement that does not alter this
    unjust division of land?</strong> For having no power to employ themselves, they must,
    either as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for
    permission to labor. This competition with one another of men shut out from
    God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation, and must
    ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life can
    just be maintained and reproduction carried on.</p>
  <p>This is not to say that all wages must fall to this point,
                    but that the wages of that necessarily largest stratum of
                laborers who
                          have only ordinary
                                  knowledge, skill and aptitude must so fall.
                The wages
                        of special classes, who are fenced off from the pressure
                    of competition by peculiar
                              knowledge,
                                  skill or other causes, may remain above that
                    ordinary level.
                            Thus, where the ability to read and write is rare
                its possession enables a
                              man to
                                obtain higher wages than the ordinary laborer.
                    But as the diffusion of education
                                  makes the ability to read and write general
                this advantage is lost. So when a vocation requires special training
                      or skill,
                        or is
                            made difficult
                                of access
                                  by artificial restrictions, the checking of
                competition
                        tends to keep
                                wages in it at a higher level. But as the progress
                      of invention dispenses with
                                  peculiar skill, or artificial restrictions
                are broken down, these higher wages sink to the ordinary level.
                    And so,
                      it is only
                          so long
                            as they
                                are special that such qualities as industry,
                prudence
                      and thrift can enable the
                                  ordinary laborer to maintain a condition above
                    that which gives a mere living. Where they become general,
                    the law
                      of competition
                          must
                            reduce
                              the
                                earnings
                                  or savings of such qualities to the general
                level &#8212; which,
                                  land being monopolized and labor helpless,
                can be only that at which the next
                                  lowest
                                  point is the cessation of life. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><strong><em>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
    assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more productive.93
    Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition that social
    growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure of labor force
    as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied to the second, to
    50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as
    applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for
    land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon the
        distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways: First, By
        lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing out in land special
        capabilities otherwise latent, and by attaching special capabilities
        to particular lands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode, to
        which little attention has been given by political economists, is really
        the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch.
        iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks off
        land from those material things which we regard as products of the land,
        we shall find that the fundamental attribute of land is its extension.
        The right to use a piece of land gives command over a certain space &#8212; a
        certain part of the earth's surface. The area of the earth is fixed;
        the geometric relations in which any particular part of it stands to
        other parts are fixed. Man has no control over them; they are wholly
        unaffected by demand; they have no cost of production; there is no supply
        price at which they can be produced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface
        is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it gives him room
        for his own actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the light, the
        air and the rain which nature assigns to that area; and it determines
        his distance from, and in great measure his relations to, other things
        and other persons. We shall find that it is this property of land, which,
        though as yet insufficient prominence has been given to it, is the ultimate
        cause of the distinction which all writers are compelled to make between
        land and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book iv, ch. ii,
        sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this regular
        way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are intended to illustrate
        the universal fact that as any land becomes a center of trade or other
        social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
    But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of labor
    increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages (as a proportion
    of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward, while that of Rent
    is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by observation. 96</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader,
        before closing this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that
        I am using the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in the
        sense of a proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises, I do
        not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers as wages is
        necessarily less, but that the proportion which it bears to the whole
        produce is necessarily less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity
        remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book
        iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would
        be the result of social growth if all land but that which was in full
        use were common land. The discovery of mines, the development of cities
        and towns, and the construction of railroads, the irrigation of and places,
        improvements in government, all the infinite conveniences and laborsaving
        devices that civilization generates, would tend to abolish poverty by
        increasing the compensation of labor, and making it impossible for any
        man to be in involuntary idleness, or underpaid, so long as mankind was
        in want. If demand for land increased, Wages would tend to fall as the
        demand brought lower grades of land into use; but they would at the same
        time tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower
        grades. And it is altogether probable that, while progress would lower
        Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase them as an
        absolute quantity.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent.</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>
  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this test.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book vii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The reader who has been deceived into believing that Mr.
        George's proposition is in any respect unjust, will find profit in a
        perusal of the entire chapter from which the foregoing extract is taken.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>

  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>

          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress

  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each
    member is capable of an independent life. He can build his own habitation,
    hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own clothing, manufacture
    his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments. He has all the knowledge of
    nature possessed by his tribe &#8212; knows what vegetable productions are
    fit for food, and where they maybe found; knows the habits and resorts of
    beasts, birds, fishes and insects; can pilot himself by the sun or the stars,
    by the turning of blossoms or the mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable
    of supplying all his wants. He may be cut off from his fellows and still
    live; and thus possesses an independent power which makes him a free contracting
    party in his relations to the community of which he is a member.</p>
  <p>Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized society,
    whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but the infinitesimal
    part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of things that constitute the
    wealth of society and go to supply even the most primitive wants; who not
    only cannot make even the tools required for his work, but often works with
    tools that he does not own, and can never hope to own. Compelled to even
    closer and more continuous labor than the savage, and gaining tby it no more
    than the savage gets &#8212; the mere necessaries of life &#8212; he loses
    the independence of the savage. He is not only unable to apply his own powers
    to the direct satisfaction of his own wants, but, without the concurrence
    of many others, he is unable to apply them indirectly to the satisfaction
    of his wants. He is a mere link in an enormous chain of producers and consumers,
    helpless to separate himself, and helpless to move, except as they move.
    The worse his position in society, the more dependent is he on society; the
    more utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself. The very power
    of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes from his own
    control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions of others, or by
    general causes over which he has no more influence than he has over the motions
    of the solar system. The primeval curse comes to be looked upon as a boon,
    and men think, and talk, and clamor, and legislate as though monotonous manual
    labor in itself were a good and not an evil, an end and not a means. Under
    such circumstances, the man loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the
    godlike power of modifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave,
    a machine, a commodity &#8212; a thing, in some respects, lower than the
    animal.</p>
  <p>I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas of
    the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or Cooper.
    I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low and narrow
    range. I believe that civilization is not only the natural destiny of man,
    but the enfranchisement, elevation, and refinement of all his powers, and
    think that it is only in such moods as may lead him to envy the cud-chewing
    cattle, that a man who is free to the advantages of civilization could look
    with regret upon the savage state. But, nevertheless, I think no one who
    will open his eyes to the facts, can resist the conclusion that there are
    in the heart of our civilization large classes with whom the veriest savage
    could not afford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if, standing
    on the threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering life as
    a Terra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in the Arctic
    Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized country as
    Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in selecting the
    lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of wealth are condemned
    to want, suffer all the privations of the savage, without his sense of personal
    freedom; they are condemned to more than his narrowness and littleness, without
    opportunity for the growth of his rude virtues; if their horizon is wider,
    it is but to reveal blessings that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

  <p> BUT it seems to us the vice of Socialism in all its degrees is its want
    of radicalism, of going to the root. . .. It assumes that the tendency of
    wages to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes
    that the natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks
    to abolish competition by restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of governing
    power. Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the stone
    for hitting it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not
    worse are futile. Associated though it is in many places with democratic
    aspiration, yet its essence is the same delusion to which the Children of
    Israel yielded when, against the protest of their prophet, they insisted
    on a king; the delusion that has everywhere corrupted democracies and enthroned
    monarchs &#8212; that power over the people can be used for the benefit of
    the people; that there may be devised machinery that through human agencies
    will secure for the management of individual affairs more wisdom and more
    virtue than the people themselves possess. &#8212; The Condition of Labor,
    an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII </p>
  <p>JUMPING to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
    that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong
    that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates a
    fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly. It fails to see that
    it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the
    natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs from
    mutual convenience, being a form of co-operation in which one of the parties
    prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls the &quot;iron
    law of wages,&quot; is not the natural law of wages, but only the law of
    wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being
    deprived of the materials for life and work. It fails to see that what it
    mistakes for the evils of competition are really the evils of restricted
    competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced
    when deprived of land. While its methods, the organization of men into industrial
    armies, the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
    or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
    Egyptian despotism. &#8212;The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope
    Leo XIII</p>
  <p>IN socialism as distinguished from individualism there is an unquestionable
    truth &#8212; and that a truth to which (especially by those most identified
    with free-trade principles) too little attention has been paid. Man is primarily
    an individual &#8212; a separate entity, differing from his fellows in desires
    and powers, and requiring for the exercise of those powers and the gratification
    of those desires individual play and freedom. But he is also a social being,
    having desires that harmonize with those of his fellows, and powers that
    can only be brought out in concerted action. There is thus a domain of individual
    action and a domain of social action &#8212; some things which can best be
    done when each acts for himself, and some things which can best be done when
    society acts for all its members. And the natural tendency of advancing civilization
    is to make social conditions relatively more important, and more and more
    to enlarge the domain of social action. This has not been sufficiently regarded,
    and at the present time, evil unquestionably results from leaving to individual
    action functions that by reason of the growth of society and the developments
    of the arts have passed into the domain of social action; just as, on the
    other hand, evil unquestionably results from social interference with what
    properly belongs to the individual. Society ought not to leave the telegraph
    and the railway to the management and control of individuals; nor yet ought
    society to step in and collect individual debts or attempt to direct individual
    industry. &#8212; Protection or Free Trade, Chapter 28 econlib </p>
  <p>NOW, why is it that men, have to work for such low wages? Because, if they
    were to demand higher wages, there are plenty of unemployed men ready to
    step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed men who compel that
    fierce competition that drives wages down to the point of bare subsistence.
    Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment? Did you ever think
    what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment? If men cannot
    find an employer, why can they not employ themselves? Simply because they
    are shut out from the element on which human labor can alone be exerted;
    men are compelled to compete with each other for the wages of an employer,
    because they have been robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves;
    because they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
    paying some other human creature for the privilege. &#8212; The Crime of
    Poverty</p>
  <p>WE laud as public benefactors those who, as we say, &quot;furnish employment.&quot; We
    are constantly talking as though this &quot;furnishing of employment,&quot; this &quot;giving
    of work&quot; were the greatest boon that could be conferred upon society.
    To listen to much that is talked and much that is written, one would think
    that the cause of poverty is that there is not work enough for so many people,
    and that if the Creator had made the rock harder, the soil less fertile,
    iron as scarce as gold, and gold as diamonds; or if ships would sink and
    cities burn down oftener, there would be less poverty, because there would
    be more work to do. &#8212; Social Problems, Chapter 8 &#8212; That We All
    Might Be Rich</p>
  <p>YOU assert the right of laborers to employment and their right to receive
    from their employers a certain indefinite wage. No such rights exist. No
    one has a right to demand employment of another, or to demand higher wages
    than the other is willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another
    to make him raise such wages against his will. There can be no better moral
    justification for such demands on employers by working-men than there would
    be for employers demanding that working-men shall be compelled to work for
    them when they do not want to, and to accept wages lower than they are willing
    to take. &#8212; The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII </p>
  <p>THE natural right which each man has, is not that of demanding employment
    or wages from another man, but that of employing himself &#8212; that of
    applying by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which the Creator
    has in the land provided for all men. Were that storehouse open, as by the
    single tax we would open it, the natural demand for labor would keep pace
    with the supply, the man who sold labor and the man who bought it would become
    free exchangers for mutual advantage, and all cause for dispute between workman
    and employer would be gone. For then, all being free to employ themselves,
    the mere opportunity to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one
    would work for another for less, all things considered, than he could earn
    by working for himself, wages would necessarily rise to their full value,
    and the relations of workman and employer be regulated by mutual interest
    and convenience. &#8212; The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo
