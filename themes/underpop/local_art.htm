    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For nearly two centuries, this arrangement worked brilliantly. There was
    no lack of creativity on either side of the Atlantic. But starting about
    thirty years ago, large entertainment companies began tipping the balance
    from the public domain to the private. Led by the Walt Disney Company, the
    corporations pushed Congress to extend copyright terms, first to seventy-five
    years and then to ninety-five. (The extensions occurred whenever Mickey Mouse
    was about to enter the public domain.) One consequence is that the public
    domain has been marginalized; corporations now take from the commons and
    give nothing back. Another is that the experience of culture has been altered;
    we&#8217;re now consumers of culture rather than participants.</p>
  <p>DISNEY STORIES TAKEN FROM THE PUBLIC DOMAIN<br>
    Aladdin<br>
    Atlantis<br>
    Beauty and the Beast<br>
    Cinderella<br>
    Davy Crockett<br>
    The Legend of Sleepy<br>
    Hollow<br>
    Hercules<br>
    The Hunchback of Notre Dame	The Jungle Book<br>
    Oliver Twist<br>
    Pinocchio<br>
    Robin Hood<br>
    Snow White<br>
    Sleeping Beauty<br>
    The Three Musketeers<br>
    Treasure Island<br>
    The Wind in the Willows<br>
    DISNEY STORIES ADDED TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN<br>
    None</p>
  <p><br>
    This isn&#8217;t to say that corporate art is bad art; much of what Hollywood
    produces is astonishingly good. The trouble is that, with its massive advertising
    and distribution budgets, it tends to overwhelm local and live art. There&#8217;s
    more intimacy, spontaneity, and experimentation in this kind of art. Local
    art also builds community, not only among artists but among audience members
    too. The challenge is to have both this kind of art and corporate art.</p>
  <p>One can imagine a culture in which free concerts in parks, poets in schools
    and libraries, independent theaters and filmmakers, and murals and sculptures
    by local artists in public spaces thrive alongside corporate entertainment.
    There&#8217;s no lack of artists who&#8217;d participate in such a culture,
    or of nonartists who&#8217;d appreciate it. The problem is how to pay for
    it.</p>
  <p>What we need is a parallel economy for noncorporate art. Fortunately, models
    of such an economy exist. For example, there&#8217;s the San Francisco Grants
    for the Arts program, funded from a tax on hotel rooms. Since 1961, the program
    has distributed over $145 million to hundreds of nonprofit cultural organizations.
    It&#8217;s a prime reason the city pulses with free concerts, murals, film
    festivals, and theater in the park.</p>
  <p>Then there&#8217;s the Music Performance Trust Fund, set up in 1948. To
    settle a dispute with the musicians&#8217; union, the recording industry
    agreed to pay a small royalty from recording sales into a fund supporting
    live concerts in parks, schools, and other public venues. The fund was, and
    continues to be, administered by an independent trustee. In 2004 it sponsored
    over eleven thousand free concerts throughout the United States and Canada.
    Thanks to this system, sales of corporate-owned music support the living
    culture on which the recording industry ultimately depends.</p>
  <p>These models could be scaled up. As a revenue source, consider what companies
    like Disney get with their copyrights. They get ninety-five-year protection
    for their movies, they get those FBI warnings on our DVDs, they get the U.S.
    government extending intellectual property rights worldwide, and they get
    police busting street vendors for selling &#8220;pirated&#8221; DVDs. That
    kind of protection is worth big bucks. Yet the companies&#8217; price tag
    for it is exactly zero. (They do pay taxes, but so does everybody else.)</p>
  <p>What if, instead of supplying copyright protection for free, we charged
    a royalty on sales of electronically reproduced music, films, and video games?
    This could be supplemented by charging broadcasters for their exclusive licenses,
    and advertisers for their invasions of our brains (see the following section).
    The resulting billions could be distributed, through a National Arts Trust,
    to local arts councils, which in turn would support community arts institutions
    and artists. Under this system, corporations would give back to a commons
    they now take from for free. More art would be live and local, and more artists
    would be employed. We&#8217;d have corporate and authentic culture at the
    same time. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
