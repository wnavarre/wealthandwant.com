<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p><strong>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. </strong>(5.)*</p>
  <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
    Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
    by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
  <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
    it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
    as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
    To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land
    to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
  <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
    the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold
    it as his own private possession.</p>
  <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
    for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
    he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only
    to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he
    pleases.</p>
  <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for greater
    security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages in another
    form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
    be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
  <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
    for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country, in
    my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
    defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
    bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the
    people. By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children
    from parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the
    buying and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
    with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived
    sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of
    his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here
    is a poor widow; all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes,
    the earnings of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by
    freeing these negroes?&#8221; And because of this perversion of reason, this
    confounding of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
    of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation
    a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
  <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
    property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same
    error into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same;
    it is essentially the same. Private property in land, no less than private
    property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. They are
    different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
    ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
    God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
  <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
    man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
    master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
    to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
    Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
  <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
    of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
    neck.</p>
  <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor of another
    without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully as chattel
    slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
    enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
    of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil
    do the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves
    of our Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner
    of Europe in ruder times to demand the jus primae noctis? Does not the same
    last outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
    wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
  <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
    on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine enriched
    their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men, they gave
    land. And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no free land
    remains to which the landless man may turn, then without further violence
    the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property in
    land takes the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient.
    For under it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when
    not needed. He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when
    no longer wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as
    efficacious. This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English
    conquerors of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land.
    This is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World, not
    to Europe.</p>
  <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
    form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in more
    insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory
    of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior
    monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending
    into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery
    the same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
    of the other!</p>
  <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far.
                  What shall your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of
              their rifles they demand
                        of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he
              shall declare that he bought them with his savings, and producing
              a copy
                of your
                  Encyclical,
                        shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
                        his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who
                        bear your blessing and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive
                        him of the liberty of disposing of his wages and thus
                        of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock
                        and bettering his condition in life&#8221;? ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

  <br>
OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

15, Slavery and Slavery</a></p>
  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>
  <br>
THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or sewing machines,
thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows straining and striving
to bring up the little ones deprived of their natural bread-winner; the children
that are growing up in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions
in which only a miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn
them in advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they
die,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>because we permit them to be
robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a system which disinherits the
vast majority of the children that come into the world. There is enough and to
spare for them. Had they the equal rights in the estate which their Creator has
given them, there would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out
a mere existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put
bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we
may see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that are
deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization today. &#8212; <a href="George_TSNS.html">Thou

  <p><font size="-1">&quot;No, I haven't any title from its maker.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, what is your title, anyhow?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, my title is good enough. I got here first.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Of course he got there first. But he didn't mean to, and
      he wouldn't have done it if he could have helped it. But the newcomer is
      satisfied, and says:</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, that's a good United States title, so I guess
      I'll recognize it and come ashore. But remember, I am to be a free man.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you are. Come right along up to my cabin.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">For a time the two get along well enough together. But on
      some fine morning the proprietor concludes that he would rather lie abed
      than scurry around for his breakfast and not being in a good humor, perhaps,
      he somewhat roughly commands his &quot;brother man&quot; to cook him a
      bird.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;What?&quot; exclaims the brother.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;I tell you to go and kill a bird and cook it for my
      breakfast.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;That sounds big,&quot; sneers the second free and
      equal member of the little community; &quot;but what am I to get for doing
      this?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh,&quot; the first replies languidly, &quot;if you
      kill me a fat bird and cook it nicely, then after I have had my breakfast
      off the bird you may cook the gizzard for your own breakfast. That's pay
      enough. The work is easy.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;But I want you to understand that I am not your slave,
      and I won't do that work for that pay. I'll do as much work for you as
      you do for me, and no more.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then, sir,&quot; the first comer shouts in virtuous
      wrath, &quot;I want you to understand that my charity is at an end. I have
      treated you better than you deserved in the past, and this is your gratitude.
      Now I don't propose to have any loafers on my property. You will work for
      the wages I offer or get off my land! You are perfectly free. Take the
      wages or leave them. Do the work or let it alone. There is no slavery here.
      But if you are not satisfied with my terms, leave my island!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The second man, if accustomed to the usages of the labor
      unions, would probably go out and, to the music of his own violent language
      about the &quot;greed of capital,&quot; destroy as many bows and arrows
      as he could, so as to paralyze the bird-shooting industry; and this proceeding
      he would call a strike for honest wages and the dignity of labor. If he
      were accustomed to social reform notions of the namby-pamby variety, he
      would propose an arbitration, and be mildly indignant when told that there
      was nothing to arbitrate &#8212; that he had only to accept the other's
      offer or get off his property. But if a sensible man, he would notify his
      comrade that the privilege of owning islands in that latitude had expired.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Note 57: While in the Pennsylvania coal regions a few years
      ago I was told of an incident that illustrates the power of perpetuating
      poverty which resides in the absolute ownership of land.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The miners were in poverty. Despite the lavish protection
      bestowed upon them by tariff laws at the solicitation of monopolies which
      dictate our tariff policy, the men were afflicted with poverty in many
      forms. They were poor as to clothing, poor as to shelter, poor as to food,
      and to be more specific, they were in extreme poverty as to ice. When the
      summer months came they lacked this thing because they could not afford
      to buy, and they suffered.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Owing to the undermining of the ground and the caving in
      of the surface here and there, there were great holes into which the snow
      and the rain fell in winter and froze, forming a passable quality of ice.
      Now it is frequently said that intelligence, industry, and thrift will
      abolish poverty. But these virtues were not successful among the men of
      whom I speak. They were intelligent enough to see that this ice if they
      saved it would abolish their poverty as to ice, and they were industrious
      enough and thrifty enough not only to be willing to save it, but actually
      to begin the work. Preparing little caves to preserve the ice in, they
      went into the holes after a long day's work in the mines, and gathered
      what so far as the need of ice was concerned was to abolish their poverty
      in the ensuing summer. But the owner of this part of the earth &#8212; a
      man who had neither made the earth, nor the rain, nor the snow, nor the
      ice, nor even the hole &#8212; telegraphed his agent forbidding the removal
      of ice except upon payment of a certain sum per ton.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The miners couldn't afford the condition. They controlled
      the necessary Labor, and were willing to give it to abolish their poverty;
      but the Land was placed beyond their reach by an owner, and in consequence
      of that, and not from any lack of intelligence, industry, or thrift on
      their own part, their poverty as to ice was perpetuated. </font>... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read
