<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Investing&quot; in land doesn't create anything. It merely siphons the entrepreneur's
    dollars away from creating jobs, buying equipment and materials. We should
    be pursuing strategies which encourage productive activity, and avoid discouraging
    it! Land Value Taxation is perhaps the very best strategory for this.</p>

                        Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Your Holiness will see from the explanation I have given that the reform
      we propose, like all true reforms, has both an ethical and an economic
      side. By ignoring the ethical side, and pushing our proposal merely as
      a reform of taxation, we could avoid the objections that arise from confounding
      ownership with possession and attributing to private property in land that
      security of use and improvement that can be had even better without it.
      All that we seek practically is the legal abolition, as fast as possible,
      of taxes on the products and processes of labor, and the consequent concentration
      of taxation on land values irrespective of improvements. To put our proposals
      in this way would be to urge them merely as a matter of wise public expediency.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>THE fundamental principle of human action &#8212; the law that is to
        political economy what the law of gravitation is to physics &#8212; is
        that men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion. . . .
        Now, under this principle, what, in conditions of freedom, will be the
        terms at which one man can hire others to work for him? Evidently, they
        will be fixed by what the men could make if laboring for themselves.
        The principle which will prevent him from having to give anything above
        this except what is necessary to induce the change, will also prevent
        them from taking less. Did they demand more, the competition of others
        would prevent them from getting employment. Did he offer less, none would
        accept the terms, as they could obtain greater results by working for
        themselves. Thus, although the employer wishes to pay as little as possible,
        and the employee to receive as much as possible, wages will be fixed
        by the value or produce of such labor to the laborers themselves. If
        wages are temporarily carried either above or below this line, a tendency
        to carry them back at once arises. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book
        III, Chapter 6 &#8212; The Laws of Distribution: Wages and the Law of
        Wages<br>
          </a><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> THE effect of all the circumstances
          which give rise to the differences between wages in different occupations
          may be included as supply and demand, and it is perfectly correct to
          say that the wages in different occupations will vary relatively according
          to differences in the supply and demand of labor &#8212; meaning by
          demand the call which the community as a whole makes for services of
          the particular kind, and by supply the relative amount of labor which,
          under the existing conditions, can be determined to the performance
          of those particular services. But though this is true as to the relative
          differences of wages, when it is said, as is commonly said, that the
          general rate of wages is determined by supply and demand, the words
          are meaningless. For supply and demand are but relative terms. The
          supply of labor can only mean labor offered in exchange for labor,
          or the produce of labor, and the demand for labor can only mean labor
          or the produce of labor offered in exchange for labor. Supply is thus
          demand, and demand supply, and in the whole community, one must be
          coextensive with the other. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book
          III, Chapter 6 &#8212; The Laws of Distribution: Wages and the Law
          of Wages</a><br>
          <br>
THUS, although they may from time to time alter in relation to each other, as
the circumstances which determine relative levels change, yet it is evident that
wages in all strata must ultimately depend upon wages in the lowest and widest
stratum &#8212; the general rate of wages rising or falling as these rise or
fall. <br>
          <br>
Now, the primary and fundamental occupations, upon which, so to speak, all others
are built up, are evidently those which procure wealth directly from nature;
hence the law of wages in them must be the general law of wages. And, as wages
in such occupations clearly depend upon what labor can produce at the lowest
point of natural productiveness to which it is habitually applied; therefore,
wages generally depend upon the margin of cultivation, or, to put it more exactly,
upon the highest point of natural productiveness to which labor is free to apply
itself without the payment of rent. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book
