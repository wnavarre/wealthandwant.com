<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
      of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
      sanctioned
    by Divine Law.</strong> (11.)</p>
  <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
    property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
    practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
  <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
    the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
    to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
    right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
    sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
    among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
    used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
    was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
    but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
    in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the
    Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
    by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
    fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
  <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the same
    right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor, has never
    grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery, it is the result
    of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
    whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
  <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of
    the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
    there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in
    land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. <strong>The
    sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of
    land.</strong> Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved
    duties or payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea
    that we would carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public
    uses. <strong>The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church
    lands defrayed the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief
    of the sick, the destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided
    for public defense and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion
    of the land remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free
    to pasture it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to
      land is to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts
      were rude,
    wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought
    of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which
    despite our marvelous advances now exists.</strong> Speaking of England, the highest
    authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that
    in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so helpless, so pressed
    and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth century;
    and that, save in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as
    to fear that his wife and children might come to want even were he taken
    from them. Dark and rude in many respects as they were, these were the times
    when the cathedrals and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite
    our admiration were built; the times when England had no national debt, no
    poor law, no standing army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands
    of human beings rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay
    their heads at night.</p>
  <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
    that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
    that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that
    the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in
    Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted
    in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and
    that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time
    all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners;
    while the same private ownership of land was extended over Ireland and the
    Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs.
    Even the military dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today
    have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses without one penny of other
    taxation.</p>
  <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is
    only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is
    due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large
    plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of
    slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
    English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
    manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of
    the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that land was
    to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established in English
    thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so treated by the
    United States and by the several States. And though land was at first sold
    cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also sold in large quantities
    to speculators, given away in great tracts for railroads and other purposes,
    until now the public domain of the United States, which a generation ago
    seemed illimitable, has practically gone. And this, as the experience of
    other countries shows, is the natural result in a growing community of making
    land private property. When the possession of land means the gain of unearned
    wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose,
    economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by
    the state for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands
    of users and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
    will be profitable only to users.</p>
  <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
    of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
    that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
    while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes
    the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
    civilization.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
    ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt not covet
    thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant,
    nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
    field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
    exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
    man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
    for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms
    referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. But
    the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and improvement, to
    which the right of possession and ownership does attach without recognition
    of property in the land itself. And that this reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is
    not a sanction of private property in land as it exists today is proved by
    the fact that the Mosaic code expressly denied such unqualified ownership
    in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the land also shall not be sold
    forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided
    for its reversion every fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive
    industrial conditions of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a
    foothold in the soil.</p>
  <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest
                            justification be found for the attaching to land
                      of the same right of property
                              that justly attaches to the things produced by
                      labor. Everywhere is it treated
                                as the
                                  free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the
                                  Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221; ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

          <br>
  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
