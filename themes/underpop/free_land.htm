    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 4: Land Speculation
Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
    shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of the
    margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent, must,
    like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances through
    half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches
    the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead entry or pre-emption.
    He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is forced so much farther than
    he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation which is holding these unused
    lands in expectation of increased value in the future. And when he settles,
    he will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can use, in the
    belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow him are again
    forced farther on than the necessities of production require, carrying the
  margin of cultivation to still less productive, because still more remote points.

        whether you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine,
        or the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference
        either to him or to them. In the one case, as the other, the one will
        be the absolute master of the ninety-nine &#8212; his power extending
        even to life and death, for simply to refuse them permission to live
      upon the island would be to force them into the sea.</p>
      <p>Upon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause
        must operate in the same way and to the same end &#8212; the ultimate
        result, the enslavement of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure
        increases which compels them to live on and from land which is treated
        as the exclusive property of others.</p>
      <p>Yet, it will be said: As every man has a right to the use and enjoyment
        of nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the exclusive
        right to its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his labor.
        But there is no difficulty in determining where the individual right
        ends and the common right begins. A delicate and exact test is supplied
        by value, and with its aid there is no difficulty, no matter how dense
        population may become, in determining and securing the exact rights of
        each, the equal rights of all.</p>
      <p><strong>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly.
          It is not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines
        its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is
        no better than other land which may be had for the using can have no
        value. And the value of land always measures the difference between it
        and the best land that may be had for the using. </strong>Thus, the value
        of land expresses in exact and tangible form the right of the community
        in land
        held by an individual; and rent expresses the exact amount which the
        individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal rights of
        all other members of the community. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/06_The_Remedy.htm">read

        Section VII: Justice of the Remedy; Chapter 5: Of Property in Land in
      the United States</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In short, the American people have failed to see the essential injustice
    of private property in land, because as yet they have not felt its full effects.
    This public domain &#8212;  the vast extent of land yet to be reduced to
    private possession, the enormous common to which the faces of the energetic
    were
    always turned, has been the great fact that, since the days when the first
    settlements began to fringe the Atlantic Coast, has formed our national character
    and colored our national thought.<strong> It is not that we have eschewed
    a titled aristocracy and abolished primogeniture; that we elect all our officers
    from school director up to president; that our laws run in the name of the
    people, instead of in the name of a prince; that the State knows no religion,
    and our judges wear no wigs &#8212; that we have been exempted from the
    ills that Fourth of July orators used to point to as characteristic of the
    effete despotisms
    of the Old World. <em>The general intelligence, the general comfort, the
    active invention, the power of adaptation and assimilation, the free, independent
    spirit, the energy and hopefulness that have marked our people, are not causes,
    but results &#8212; they have sprung from unfenced land.</em></strong> This public
    domain has been the transmuting force which has turned the thriftless, unambitious
    European peasant into the self-reliant Western farmer; it has given a consciousness
    of freedom even to the dweller in crowded cities, and has been a wellspring
    of hope even to those who have never thought of taking refuge upon it. The
    child of the people, as he grows to manhood in Europe, finds all the best
    seats at the banquet of life marked &quot;taken,&quot; and must struggle
    with his fellows for the crumbs that fall, without one chance in a thousand
    of forcing or sneaking his way to a seat. In America, whatever his condition,
    there has always been the consciousness that the public domain lay behind
    him; and the knowledge of this fact, acting and reacting, has penetrated
    our whole national life, giving to it generosity and independence, elasticity
    and ambition. <strong>All that we are proud of in the American character;
    all that makes our conditions and institutions better than those of older
    countries, we may trace to the fact that land has been cheap in the United
    States, because new soil has been open to the emigrant.</strong></p>
  <p>But our advance has reached the Pacific. Further west we cannot go, and
    increasing population can but expand north and south and fill up what has
    been passed over. North, it is already filling up the valley of the Red River,
    pressing into that of the Saskatchewan and pre-empting Washington Territory;
    south, it is covering western Texas and taking up the arable valleys of New
    Mexico and Arizona.</p>
  <p>The republic has entered upon a new era, an era in which the monopoly of
    the land will tell with accelerating effect. The great fact which has been
    so potent is ceasing to be. The public domain is almost gone &#8212; a very
    few years will end its influence, already rapidly failing. I do not mean
    to say
    that there will be no public domain. For a long time to come there will be
    millions of acres of public lands carried on the books of the Land Department.
    But it must be remembered that the best part of the continent for agricultural
    purposes is already overrun, and that it is the poorest land that is left.
    It must be remembered that what remains comprises the great mountain ranges,
    the sterile deserts, the high plains fit only for grazing. And it must be
    remembered that much of this land which figures in the reports as open to
    settlement is unsurveyed land, which has been appropriated by possessory
    claims or locations which do not appear until the land is returned as surveyed.
    California figures on the books of the Land Department as the greatest land
    state of the Union, containing nearly 100,000,000 acres of public land &#8212;    something
    like one-twelfth of the whole public domain. Yet so much of this is covered
    by railroad grants or held in the way of which I have spoken;
    so much consists of untillable mountains or plains which require irrigation;
    so much is monopolized by locations which command the water, that as a matter
    of fact it is difficult to point the immigrant to any part of the state where
    he can take up a farm on which he can settle and maintain a family, and so
    men, weary of the quest, end by buying land or renting it on shares. It is
    not that there is any real scarcity of land in California &#8212;  for,
    an empire in herself, California will some day maintain a population as large
    as that
    of France &#8212;  but appropriation has got ahead of the settler and manages
    to keep just ahead of him. ... <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp075.html">read

<blockquote>
  <p>WHEREVER land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
    of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or hirer,
    there is rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there
    is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives value
    to land. . . . No matter what are its capabilities, land can yield no rent
    and have no value until some one is willing to give labor or the results
    of labor for the privilege of using it; and what anyone will thus give, depends
    not upon the capacity of the land, but upon its capacity as compared with
    that of land that can be had for nothing. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html"> Book

STATED reversely, the law of rent is necessarily the law of wages and interest
taken together, for it is the assertion, that no matter what be the production
which results from the application of labor and capital, these two factors will
only receive in wages and interest such part of the produce as they could have
produced on land free to them without the payment of rent &#8212; that is the

A. If adopted in one country of great natural opportunities, and not in others,
its tendency would not only be to cause an influx of foreigners, but also to
make their coming highly desirable. Our own experience in the United States,
when we had an abundance of free land and were begging the populations of the

  <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor, especially
      they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything that is not
    fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves.
    The reformers
      in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working more than
    eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love
    to work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit
    to come
    here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came
    from.</p>
  <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
    the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
    of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
    are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria,
    instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the
    swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
    symptoms.</p>
  <p>Land Basic</p>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land
    man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
    must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single tax
    is applied.
    It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax does
    work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man turned
    from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
    continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
    he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
    there
    were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
    there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the
    surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
    only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was
    complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a job.</p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the
    coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it, and cunning men
    know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped the earth;
    and they
    say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages and ages
    to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay
    the tribute I demand.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read
