<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right
        to the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products
        of labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For
        we are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he
        has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
        is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
        life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
        you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed
        order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw
        and provided that with the increase of population and the development
        of industry the organization of human society into states or governments
        would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
      <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
        This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
        industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
        growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
        state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
      <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
        civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
        become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
        foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
        for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
        social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a right
        way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is the way
        intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising public revenues
        must accord with the moral law.</p>
      <p>Hence:</p>
      </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
      <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the
            prices of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
      <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by
            making it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take
        bribes.</li>
      <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken
            the sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are
        not sins, and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted
            right to do.</li>
      <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not
            punish thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production
            and the fairest division of wealth.
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the
                                        processes and products of industry by
          which through the civilized

                                                    these be the ways God
                                                    has intended that governments
                                                    should raise the means they
                                                    need? Have
                                                    any of them the
                                                  characteristics indispensable
                                                    in any plan we can deem a
                                                    right one?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
<p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs
          to the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over
          the scrupulous; <strong>they have the effect, nay are largely intended,
          to increase the price of what some have to sell and others must buy</strong>; they corrupt
          government; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine
          industry and thrift; <strong>they lessen the wealth that men might
          enjoy</strong>, and
        enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
        <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
        <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
          are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of
          life, that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. <strong>But
          out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and
          out of its effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell
          and others must buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which
          denies this gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy
          and proclaims laws of national well-being utterly at variance with his
          teaching. </strong>This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal
          war of <strong>hostile tariffs</strong>; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies
          in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do
          not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
        of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
        <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more
          clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not
        the way God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
        <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues
          by a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to
          tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
          any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
          values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
          exempt. The value of land irrespective of improvement is the value that
          attaches to land by reason of increasing population and social progress.
          This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and never does
          and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different person from
          the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money;
          while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that
          he receives it, and by selling or renting the land he can, as owner,
        continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
        <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
          of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
          what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
          to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to
        the community as a whole.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all
              economists are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement
              or use &#8212; or what in the terminology of political economy is
              styled rent, a term distinguished from the ordinary use of the word
              rent by being applied solely to payments for the use of land itself &#8212; must
              be paid by the owner and cannot be shifted by him on the user. To
              explain in another way the reason given in the text: Price is not
              determined by the will of the seller or the will of the buyer, but
              by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to things
              constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
              by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the
              cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
              increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce
              such cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat
              or tobacco or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay,
              and thus the cheapening in the cost of producing steel which improved
              processes have made in recent years has greatly reduced the price
              of steel. But land has no cost of production, since it is created
            by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
                by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of
                deprivation and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all
                that common labor can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
        2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
        particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
        by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
        for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
        3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
        in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
        social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
        withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore
              never be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in
              no wise increase the demand for land or enable landowners to check
              supply by withholding land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization,
              a case I mention because rent may in this way be demanded for the
              use of land even before economic or natural rent arises, the taking
              by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort from labor
              could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not
              left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent
              proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they receive, would
              in no way increase the superiority of their land and the demand for
              it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent, to compel
              the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they were
              getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult for
              them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
            merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
          of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
          to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
          impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on
          thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
          of wealth, by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please,
          without any artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public
          purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that
          of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply
          collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense
          with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish
        man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
        <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
          it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and
          degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother
        for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
        <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need
          for the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor
          have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches
          to land itself. But as increasing density of population and increasing
          elaboration of industry necessitate the organization of the state, with
          its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land. As population
          still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so the needs for public
          revenues increase. And at the same time and from the same causes land
          values increase. The connection is invariable. The value of things produced
          by labor tends to decline with social development, since the larger scale
          of production and the improvement of processes tend steadily to reduce
          their cost. But the value of land on which population centers goes up
          and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne. Consider
          the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
          of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
          due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of
          those cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure
          for streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed
          for the health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how
          with the growth of such cities the one thing that steadily increases
          in value is land; how the opening of roads, the building of railways,
          the making of any public improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it
          not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to say a tendency
          willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He who ordained
          the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land provided
        the means to meet those needs?</p>
        <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper
          still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose
          of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land
          values increase with the growth of society not only such a perfectly
          adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual
          perceptions by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with
          regard to the individual that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening
        to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
        <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one
          thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
          of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
          improvements of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of
          justice and the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common
          uses of society. Now, since increase in the fund available for the common
          uses of society is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member
          of society, is it not clear that the law by which land values increase
          with social advance while the value of the products of labor does not
          increase, tends with the advance of civilization to make the share that
          goes equally to each member of society more and more important as compared
          with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and thus to make
          the advance of civilization lessen relatively the differences that in
          a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the weak, the
          fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show the purpose of the Creator
          to be that the advance of man in civilization should be an advance not
          merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater equality, instead
          of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it, an advance
        toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

      <p><font size="-1"><strong>1. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXATION</strong></font></p>
      <p>Taxes are either direct or indirect; or, as they have been aptly described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
        taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself to
        others; direct taxes are those that cannot be shifted.5</p>
      <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their tendency
        to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall. Their magnitude
        and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for this reason that a
        great French economist of the last century denounced them as &quot;a
        scheme for so plucking geese as to get the most feathers with the least
        squawking.&quot;7 ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
