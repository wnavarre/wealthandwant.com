  <p>What does it mean when we pray &quot;thy kingdom come&quot;? <em>Aren't

      even if some of us don't yet
    see how to get from where we are to God's kingdom coming, for all? </p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
    Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs
    of civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice, the
    law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. <strong>We see that Christ was not a mere
    dreamer when he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its
    right-doing
    they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth. ...</strong></p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more
      than their share of labor on others.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
      as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
      their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
      ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same
      right of excluding their fellows.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that
        all men are children of God the common Father; that all have the same
        last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the gifts of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the
      unworthy is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet
      in all this and through all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance
      of a system that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties
      and blessings to man the exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you
      give us equal rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
    made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
    gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
    that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
    Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
    priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
    of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
    grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>
