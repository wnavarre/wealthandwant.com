<p align="center"><strong>Indirect Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry
George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
    tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous application
    of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak of it as free
    trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than
    a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not merely abolish
all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

  <p>THE mode of taxation is quite as important as the amount. As a small burden
    badly placed may distress a horse that could carry with ease a much larger
    one properly adjusted, so a people may be impoverished and their power of
    producing wealth destroyed by taxation, which, if levied in another way,
    could be borne with ease. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>IF we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must finally pay
    it, for the erection of buildings will cease until building rents become
    high enough to pay the regular profit and the tax besides. If we impose a
    tax upon manufactures or imported goods, the manufacturer or importer will
    charge it in a higher price to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer, and
    the retailer to the consumer. Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately
    falls, must not only pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this
    amount to everyone who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital
    he has advanced in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit
    on the capital he has advanced in paying for goods. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  THE way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
  supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon rent cannot
  check supply. Therefore though a tax on rent compels the landowners to pay
  more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use of their land, as it
  in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling
  those who hold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a
  tax on land values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus
  to reduce the price of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    <strong>With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which
    men would naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the
    question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. </strong>&#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><strong><font size="-1">II. THE SINGLE TAX AS A FISCAL REFORM</font></strong></p>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>1. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXATION</strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxes are either direct or indirect; or, as they have been aptly described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
    taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself to others;
    direct taxes are those that cannot be shifted.5</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">5. &quot;Taxes are either direct or indirect. A direct tax is one which
        is demanded from the very persons who, it is intended or desired, should
        pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the
        expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense
        of another.&quot; &#8212; John Stuart Mill's Prin. of Pol. Ec., book
        v, ch. iii, sec. I.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Direct taxes are those which are levied on the very persons who it
        is intended or desired should pay them, and which they cannot put off upon
        others by raising the prices of the taxed article.. . . Indirect taxes on
        the other hand are those which are levied on persons who expect to get back
        the amount of the tax by raising the price of the taxed article.&quot; &#8212; Laughlin's
        Elements, par. 249.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes are direct &quot;when the payment is made by the person who is intended
        to bear the sacrifice.&quot; Indirect taxes are recovered from final purchasers. &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 96.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Indirect taxes are so called because they are not paid into the treasury
        by the person who really bears the burden. The payer adds the amount of the
        tax to the price of the commodity taxed, and thus the taxation is concealed
        under the increased price of some article of luxury or convenience.&quot; &#8212; Thompson's
        Pol. Ec., sec. 175.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their tendency
    to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall. Their magnitude
    and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for this reason that a great
    French economist of the last century denounced them as &quot;a scheme for
    so plucking geese as to get the most feathers with the least squawking.&quot;7</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6. Jevons defines the incidence of a tax as &quot;the manner in which it
        falls upon different classes of the population.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 96.<br>
        Sometimes called &quot;repercussion,&quot; and refers &quot;to the real as
        opposed to the nominal payment of taxes.&quot; &#8212; Ely's Taxation,
        p. 64.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">7. Though his language was blunt, the sentiment does not
        essentially differ from that of &quot;statesmen&quot; of our day who
        meet all the moral and economic objections to indirect taxation with
        the one reply that
        the people
        would not consent to pay enough or the support of government if public
        revenues were collected from them directly. This means nothing but that
        the people
        are actually hoodwinked by indirect taxation into sustaining a government
        that they would not support if they knew it was maintained at their expense;
        and instead of being a reason for continuing indirect taxation, would,
        if true, be one of the strongest of reasons for abolishing it. It is
        consistent
        neither with the plainest principles of democracy nor the simplest conceptions
        of morality.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
    of vastly more concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers, enters
        into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate of profit upon
        that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the
        manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price
        and are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the tax with
        all intermediate profits upon it, together with their :usual rate of profit
        upon the whole, from final purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what
        appears on the surface to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination
        to be an indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of
        profits upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were imposed
        upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount of the
        tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect
        the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
        and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with their profit
        from retailers, who would collect with their profit from shoe consumers.
        The principle applies also when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales
        of merchants, or the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with
        the usual profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
        interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000;
        at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
        and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
        of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would
        get. Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that
        indirect
        taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed
        only upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed
        upon materials
        also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent in
        addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect taxes from
        the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers,
        or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest,
        it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is because
        the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other
        tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
        goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business. It
        follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase the price
        of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must
        pay as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the cost
        of their output as is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of
        the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase
        the price of their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as
        the tax is more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
        such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
        copyright publications
        is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly manufacturer whose
        prices are not checked by cost of production, and are therefore as a
      rule higher than competitive prices would be, may find it more profitable
      to bear
        the burden of a tax that leaves him some profit, by preserving his entire
        custom, than to drive off part of his custom by adding the tax to his
      usual prices. This is true also of a moderate import tax to the extent
      it falls
        upon goods that are more cheaply transported from the place of production
        to a foreign market where the import tax is imposed than to a home market
        where the goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance,
        of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian
        town. If the tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation
        the producer will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate
        effect would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
        may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
        will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
        cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">9. &quot;To collect taxes, to prevent and punish evasions, to check and
            countercheck revenue drawn from so many distinct sources, now make up probably
            three-fourths, perhaps seven-eighths, of the business of government outside
            of the preservation of order, the maintenance of the military arm, and the
            administration of justice.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv,
          ch: v</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">10. For a brief and thorough exposition of indirect taxation

          or Free Trade,&quot; ch. viii, on &quot; Tariffs for Revenue.&quot;</font></p>

  <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>

        as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities shift to consumers they
        jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes upon land values would shift
        to the users. But this is a mistake, and the explanation is simple. Taxes
        upon what men produce make production more difficult and so tend toward scarcity
        in the supply, which stimulates prices; but taxes upon land, provided the
        taxes be levied in proportion to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning
        market supply of course), because they make it more difficult to hold valuable
        land idle, and so depress prices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord. There are no means by
        which he can shift the burden upon anyone else. . . A tax on rent, therefore,
        has no effect other than its obvious one. It merely takes so much from the
        landlord and transfers it to the state.&quot; &#8212; John Stuart Mill's
        Prin. of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. 1.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax laid upon rent is borne solely by the owner of land.&quot; &#8212; Bascom's
        Tr., p.159.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Taxes which are levied on land . . . really fall on the owner of the
        land.&quot; &#8212; Mrs. Fawcett's Pol. Ec. for Beginners, pp.209, 210.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land tax levied in proportion to the rent of land, and varying with
        every variation of rents, . . . will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; &#8212; Walker's
        Pol. Ec., ed. of 1887, p. 413, quoting Ricardo.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person who actually pays
        it to some other person varies with the object taxed. A tax on rents cannot
        be transferred. A tax on commodities is always transferred to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; Thorold
        Rogers's Pol. Ec., ch. xxi, 2d ed., p. 285.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor, the tax
        is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to allow
        it in payment of the rent.&quot; &#8212; Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations,
        book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production
        and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes
        upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though a tax upon rent compels
        land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use
        of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the
        contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation to sell or let
        for what they can get, a tax on land values tends to increase the competition
        between owners, and thus to reduce the price of land.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting the tax in higher
        rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of shifting it to the consumers
        of goods in higher prices. The principle is the same. Merchants cannot charge
        higher prices for goods than their competitors do, merely because they pay
        higher ground rents. A country storekeeper whose business lot is worth but
        few dollars charges as much for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer
        whose lot is worth thousands. Quality for quality and quantity for quantity,
        goods sell for about the same price everywhere. Differences in price are
        altogether in favor of places where land has a high value. This is due to
        the fact that the cost of getting goods to places of low land value, distant
        villages for example, is greater than to centers, which are places of high
        land value. Sometimes it is true that prices for some things are higher where
        land values are high. Tiffany's goods, for instance, may be more expensive
        than goods of the same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But that
        is not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has a reputation
        for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad among rich people),
        for which his customers are willing to pay whether his store is on a high
        priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Though land value has no effect upon the price of good,
        it is easier to sell goods in some locations
      than in others. Therefore, though
                                            the price
                                                  and the profit of each sale
      be the same, or even less, in good locations than in poorer ones, aggregate
                            receipts
                                      and aggregate
                                          profits
                                            are
                                              much greater at the good location.
        And it is out of his
                                      aggregate, and not out
                                                of each
                                                  profit, that rent is paid,
      For
        example: A cigar store on
                                          a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality
            of cigar for
                                    fifteen cents. On a side
                                            street the same quality
                                                  of cigar can be bought no cheaper.
                Indeed, the cigars there are likely to be poorer, and therefore
                    really dearer.
                                      Yet ground
                                          rent on
                                            the thoroughfare
                                                  is very high compared with
      ground rent on the sidestreet. How, then, can
                                                  the first dealer, he who pays
      the high ground rent, afford to sell as good or better cigars for fifteen
                                cents
                                    than
                                      his competitor
                                            of the
                                              low
                                                priced
                                                  location? Simply because he
      is
        able to make so many more sales
                                            with a given outlay of labor and
      capital in a given time that his aggregate profit
                                                is
                                                  greater. This is due to the
      advantage of his location, and for that
                                              advantage he pays a premium in
      higher ground rent. But that premium is not charged
                                                  to smokers; the competing dealer
            of the side street protects them. It represents the greater ease,
      the lower cost,
                                      of doing
                                          a given volume
                                              of
                                                business upon
                                                  the site for which it is paid;
        add if the state should take any of it, even the whole of it, in taxation,
                                the loss
                                      would be finally
                                            borne
                                              by the
                                                owner
                                                  of the advantage which attaches
        to
                that
                        site &#8212; by
                                                  the landlord. Any attempt to
                        shift it to tenant or buyer would
                                                  be promptly
                                                  checked by the competition
                                                  of neighboring but cheaper

  <p><em>Q28. If taxes have to be paid by labor, what difference does it make to
    laborers whether they are levied in proportion to land values, or otherwise?</em><br>
    A. When taxes are levied upon earners in proportion to earnings, they take
    what the earners would otherwise keep; but when they are levied upon land-owners
    in proportion to land values, they take what the earners must in any event
    lose.</p>
