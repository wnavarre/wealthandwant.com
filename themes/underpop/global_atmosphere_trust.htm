    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 9: Building the Commons Sector (pages 135-154)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    According to a near-unanimous consensus of scientists, the world is very
      close to a tipping point on atmospheric carbon: we must drastically curtail
      our carbon burning or climate hell will soon break loose. This means every
      nation must install economy-wide valves for reducing their carbon use.
      I described earlier how America might do this using a carbon, or sky trust.
      Since we can&#8217;t halt global warming by ourselves, however, the necessary
      complement to such an American trust is a global trust.</p>
  <p><br>
    A global carbon trust would require national governments to recognize that,
      just as they can, and should, delegate internal trusteeship duties to trusts,
      so should they delegate global trusteeship duties. The alternative, I&#8217;d
      argue, is paralysis in the face of clear and present danger.</p>
  <p>Consider the long and tortuous climate negotiations that began in the early
    1990s. They produced, first, a toothless pledge by all nations &#8212; the
    Rio Convention of 1992 &#8212; to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas
    emissions to the 1990 level by 2010. Five years later, they produced a slightly
    toothier protocol in Kyoto, which took another five years to ratify and translate
    into operational rules. An equally prolonged negotiation now looms for the
    successor to Kyoto, which expires in 2012.</p>
  <p>No doubt these negotiations could move faster if the current U.S. administration
    weren&#8217;t so obstinately opposed to them. But the deeper problem is that
    nearly two hundred sovereign nations are trying to negotiate a deal that
    satisfies everyone. The process is inherently cumbersome, and not surprisingly,
    the results fall far short of what scientists say is necessary. Perhaps,
    therefore, it&#8217;s time to delegate. I can imagine a global atmosphere
    trust working something like this. It would be governed by a smallish board
    of trustees and a general membership consisting of all signatory nations.
    The general membership would appoint the trustees. There might be, as in
    the U.N. Security Council, a number of seats reserved for &#8220;great powers&#8221; (in
    this case, large emitters) and another number set aside for regions. However,
    once trustees are appointed, their loyalty would shift from individual nations
    or regions to future generations. This is critical.</p>
  <p>The trustees would decide, based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence, where
    to set a global cap on carbon emissions. Each year, they&#8217;d issue tradeable
    carbon emission permits up to that year&#8217;s limit. A portion of these
    permits (initially, a majority) would be distributed at no cost to participating
    nations based on a pre-agreed formula. The remainder would be auctioned by
    the trust, with the revenue used to remediate damage caused by climate change
    and aid the inevitable victims. The trust would determine on a yearly basis
    how many permits were needed for these purposes, and how the remediation
    funds would be spent.</p>
  <p>The trustees would make decisions by majority vote, with no vetoes. Like
    a court, they&#8217;d explain their decisions in writing, showing exactly
    how they protect future generations. The general membership could override
    a trustee decision by, say, a two-thirds majority. In this way, signatory
    nations could put short-term interests over long-term ones, but they&#8217;d
    have to do so explicitly, and implicitly admit to stealing or borrowing from
    future generations.</p>
  <p>The knotty question is, What formula should be used to distribute carbon
    emission permits among nations? The key to crafting such a formula, given
    the disparate interests of so many nations, is to ground it on some universal
    principle of equity. The Kyoto Protocol didn&#8217;t do this; it was a hodgepodge
    of deals and escape hatches aimed at pleasing the United States, which in
    the end didn&#8217;t ratify anyway. The next international regime, however,
    must appeal to the poor and the up-and-coming, as well as to the United States
    and other developed countries. Without an organizing principle based on equity,
    it&#8217;s hard to see how any deal can be reached.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, an equitable organizing principle has been advanced: it&#8217;s
    known as contract and converge. Here&#8217;s how it would work.</p>
  <p>First, an overall reduction schedule would be agreed to; this is the contract
    part of the equation. Then, rights to the global atmospheric commons would
    be divided among nations in proportion to their populations &#8212; in other
    words, one person, one share.</p>
  <p>However, absolute proportionality wouldn&#8217;t kick in for a decade or
    two, during which time the allocation formula would converge toward proportionality.
    The rate of convergence would be a topic for negotiation; the goal of per
    capita equity would be accepted at the outset.</p>
  <p>Before and after convergence, poor and populous countries with more permits
    than emissions could sell their excess permits to rich and relatively underpopulated
    countries that are short on them. In this way, nations could pollute at different
    levels, with overusers of the atmosphere paying underusers for the privilege.
    Americans could, in other words, extend our present level of carbon use for
    another decade or so, but we&#8217;d have to pay poor countries to do so.</p>
  <p>Would a global atmospheric trust be too great a surrender of national sovereignty?
    I think not. We&#8217;re not talking about world government here. We&#8217;re
    talking about a trust to manage a specific worldwide commons. The one and
    only job of that trust would be to set and enforce limits on certain emissions
    into that commons. Some loss of sovereignty is involved, but less than we&#8217;ve
    already yielded to the World Trade Organization. Compared to the benefit
    we and all nations would gain &#8212; a stabilized climate &#8212; our loss
    of sovereignty would be small potatoes.</p>
  <p>If a global atmosphere trust could be established, it would be a watershed
    twenty-first-century event. Geopolitically, it could lay the foundation for
    a harmonious century, much as the Versailles Treaty paved the way for a disharmonious
    one in the twentieth. It would also help the world deal gracefully with the
    decline in global oil production that experts say is imminent.</p>
  <p>Economically, a global atmosphere trust would spur some important changes.
    Corporations the world over would immediately pour money into energy efficiency
    and noncarbon energy infrastructure. There&#8217;d be a rush to deploy new
    technologies. Economies &#8212; including ours &#8212; would boom, not despite
    higher carbon prices, but because of them.</p>
  <p>Why would this happen? The simplest reason is that a global atmosphere trust
    would remove an enormous cloud of uncertainty. Businesses would see the future
    of carbon burning, and be more confident that a price shock &#8212; more
    damaging than a gradual rise &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t derail their plans. Such
    a trust would also remove a major source of international tension &#8212; the
    scramble for declining oil supplies &#8212; that could easily lead to war.
    In addition, the flow of money to poor countries (from sales of emission
    permits to rich countries) would lift their economies and wages, help U.S.
    exports and slow U.S. job loss. All these things would ensure that while
    high-carbon activity declines, low-carbon activity rises at a comparable
    rate.</p>
  <p>But growth in aggregate economic activity isn&#8217;t the only benefit we&#8217;d
                  see; qualitative improvements would also occur. Thus, as long-distance transport
                  costs rose, manufacturers would shift from global to local production. Farmers
                  would return to practices they used before cheap petrochemicals became available.
                  They&#8217;d grow more food organically and sell more through farmers&#8217; markets
                  and urban buying clubs, cutting out middlemen and keeping more of their products&#8217; value.
                  For nonperishables, consumers would shop more on the Internet and less at
                  drive-and-haul malls. Thanks to eBay, Craigslist, and similar services, they&#8217;d
                  also buy more secondhand goods and dump fewer into landfills. More workers
                  would ride bikes, jitneys, and trains, and work online from home. Cities
                  would favor footpower, suburbs would reorganize around transit hubs, and
                  new forms of co-housing would spread. All these changes would be profitable
                  and even exciting. And they&#8217;d proceed with relative smoothness
                  if we placed the global atmosphere in trust.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, if we leave our atmosphere as an unmanaged waste dump,
    our glorious industrial party will abruptly end, brought to its knees by
    oil price shocks, climate disasters, or a monetary panic. After that, no
    one can know what will happen. That&#8217;s the stark choice we face. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
