<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/02_SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
    Increasing Importance of Social Questions</a> (Chapter 1 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social
Problems</a></em></strong>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[07] In this progression which begins with man, as in that which leads up
    to him, the same law holds. Each advance makes a demand for higher and higher
    intelligence. With the beginnings of society arises the need for social intelligence &#8212; for
    that consensus of individual intelligence which forms a public opinion, a
    public conscience, a public will, and is manifested in law, institutions
    and administration. As society develops, a higher and higher degree of this
    social intelligence is required, for the relation of individuals to each
    other becomes more intimate and important, and the increasing complexity
    of the social organization brings liability to new dangers.</p>
  <p>[13] There is in all the past nothing to compare with the rapid changes
    now going on in the civilized world. It seems as though in the European race,
    and in the nineteenth century, man was just beginning to live &#8212; just
    grasping his tools and becoming conscious of his powers. The snail's pace
    of crawling ages has suddenly become the headlong rush of the locomotive,
    speeding faster and faster. This rapid progress is primarily in industrial
    methods and material powers. But industrial changes imply social changes
    and necessitate political changes. Progressive societies outgrow institutions
    as children outgrow clothes. Social progress always requires greater intelligence
    in the management of public affairs; but this the more as progress is rapid
    and change quicker.</p>
  <p>[14] And that the rapid changes now going on are bringing up problems that
    demand most earnest attention may be seen on every hand. Symptoms of danger,
    premonitions of violence, are appearing all over the civilized world. Creeds
    are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces of conservatism are melting
    away. Political institutions are failing, as clearly in democratic America
    as in monarchical Europe. There is growing unrest and bitterness among the
    masses, whatever be the form of government, a blind groping for escape from
    conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute all this to the teachings of
    demagogues is like attributing the fever to the quickened pulse. It is the
    new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles. To put into a sailing-ship
    the powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer would be to tear her
    to pieces with their play. So the new powers rapidly changing all the relations
    of society must shatter social and political organizations not adapted to
    meet their strain.</p>
  <p>[15] To adjust our institutions to growing needs and changing conditions
    is the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism, human sympathy,
    and religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake it. There is danger
    in reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism. The problems
    beginning to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that there is fear they
    may not be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes. But their gravity
    comes from indisposition to recognize frankly and grapple boldly with them.</p>
  <p>[16] These dangers, which menace not one country alone, but modern civilization
    itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling to be born &#8212; that
    the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown conditions and institutions
    that before sufficed.</p>
  <p>[17] A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands
    of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably
    evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization is possible in which
    the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the
    rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies
    unthought of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence
    that will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are already
    in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment
    from the very excess of wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say
    manufacturers, &quot;and we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give
    us but work!&quot; cry idle men.</p>
  <p>[18] The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
    of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
    of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
    forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
    produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
    Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
    but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet
    agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years
    ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption,
    we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph
    of mechanical skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had
    to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New
    York aldermen. The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned
    in a crazed and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only
    by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass
    is estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer could
    not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable.</p>
  <p>[19] The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
    be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few, but
    that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political
    economy to college professors. The people themselves must think, because
    the people alone can act.</p>
  <p>[20] In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
                      the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
                      This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
                      having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But the
                      salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of humanity,
                      is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ.
                      Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more
                      the business of
                      each; it binds
                      all closer and closer together in bonds from which none
                      can escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties,
                      and
                      cares for his
                      family, yet
                      takes
                      no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to
                      those who are trodden under foot, save now and then to
                      bestow aims,
                      is not
                      a true Christian.
                      Nor
                      is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and
                      harder than this.</p>
  <p>[21] The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not
    a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
    and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond self-interest,
    whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many. It must seek justice.
    For at the bottom of every social problem we will find a social wrong. <a href="../../HG/SP/02_SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[18]</font> The people are largely conscious of all this, and there is among the
  masses much dissatisfaction. <strong>But there is a lack of that intelligent interest
  necessary to adapt political organization to changing conditions. The popular
  idea of reform seems to be merely a change of men or a change of parties, not
  a change of system. Political children, we attribute to bad men or wicked parties
  what really springs from deep general causes. </strong>Our two great political parties
  have really nothing more to propose than the keeping or the taking of the offices
  from the other party. On their outskirts are the Greenbackers, who, with a
  more or less definite idea of what they want to do with the currency, represent
  vague social dissatisfaction; civil service reformers, who hope to accomplish
  a political reform while keeping it out of politics; and anti-monopolists,
  who propose to tie up locomotives with packthread. Even the labor organizations
  seem to fear to go further in their platforms than some such propositions as
  eight-hour laws, bureaus of labor statistics, mechanics' liens, and prohibition
  of prison contracts. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
