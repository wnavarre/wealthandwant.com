<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
  2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
  (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
  3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN, paragraph
  8.) ...<br>
  4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
  paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
  5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of mankind,
  and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned by Divine
  Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
  6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
  in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
  7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
  and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
  8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not from
  man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the value
  of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private owner.
  (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p>Believing that the social question is at bottom a religious question, we
      deem it of happy augury to the world that in your Encyclical the most influential
      of all religious teachers has directed attention to the condition of labor.</p>
  <p>But while we appreciate the many wholesome truths you utter, while we feel,
                            as all must feel, that you are animated by a desire to help the suffering
                            and oppressed, and to put an end to any idea that the church is divorced
                            from the aspiration for liberty and progress, yet it is painfully obvious
                            to us that one fatal assumption hides from you the cause of the evils you
                            see, and makes it impossible for you to propose any adequate remedy. <strong>This
                            assumption is, that private property in land is of
                            the same nature and has the same sanctions as private
                            property in things produced by labor. </strong>In spite
                            of its undeniable truths and its benevolent spirit, your Encyclical shows
                            you to be involved in such difficulties as a physician called to examine
                            one suffering from disease of the stomach would meet should he begin with
                            a refusal to consider the stomach.</p>
  <p>Prevented by this assumption from seeing the true cause, the only causes
    you find it possible to assign for the growth of misery and wretchedness
    are the destruction of working-men&#8217;s guilds in the last century, the
    repudiation in public institutions and laws of the ancient religion, rapacious
    usury, the custom of working by contract, and the concentration of trade.</p>
  <p>Such diagnosis is manifestly inadequate to account for evils that are alike
    felt in Catholic countries, in Protestant countries, in countries that adhere
    to the Greek communion and in countries where no religion is professed by
    the state; that are alike felt in old countries and in new countries; where
    industry is simple and where it is most elaborate; and amid all varieties
    of industrial customs and relations.</p>
  <p><strong>But the real cause will be clear if you will consider that since labor must
    find its workshop and reservoir in land, the labor question is but another
    name for the land question, and will reexamine your assumption that private
    property in land is necessary and right.</strong></p>
  <p>See how fully adequate is the cause I have pointed out. The most important
    of all the material relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits,
    and hence, the &#8220;impious resistance to the benevolent intentions of
    his Creator,&#8221; which, as Bishop Nulty says, is involved in <strong>private
    property in land</strong>, must produce evils wherever it exists. But by virtue of the law, &#8220;unto
    whom much is given, from him much is required,&#8221; <strong>the very progress of
    civilization makes the evils produced by private property in land more wide-spread
    and intense.</strong></p>
  <p>What is producing throughout the civilized world that condition of things
    you rightly describe as intolerable is not this and that local error or minor
    mistake. It is nothing less than the progress of civilization itself; nothing
    less than the intellectual advance and the material growth in which our century
    has been so preeminent, <strong>acting in a state of society based on private
    property in land</strong>; nothing less than the new gifts that in our time God has been showering
    on man, but which are being turned into scourges by man&#8217;s &#8220;impious
    resistance to the benevolent intentions of his Creator.&#8221; ....</p>
  <p>Your Holiness will remember the great London dock strike of two years ago,
    which, with that of other influential men, received the moral support of
    that Prince of the Church whom we of the English speech hold higher and dearer
    than any prelate has been held by us since the blood of Thomas &agrave; Becket
    stained the Canterbury altar.</p>
  <p>In a volume called &#8220;<em><strong>The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike</strong></em>,&#8221; written
    by Messrs. H. Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
    Buxton, M.P., which advocates trades-unionism as the solution of the labor
    question, and of which a large number were sent to Australia as a sort of
    official recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers,
    I find in the summing up, on pages 164-165, the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more regular, better
        paid, and carried on under better conditions than ever before. All this
      will be an unqualified gain to those who get the benefit from it. But another
        result will undoubtedly be to contract the field of employment and lessen
        the number of those for whom work can be found. The lower-class casual
      will,
        in the end, find his position more precarious than ever before, in proportion
        to the increased regularity of work which the &#8220;fitter&#8221; of the
        laborers will secure. The effect of the organization of dock labor, as of
        all classes of labor, will be to squeeze out the residuum. The loafer, the
        cadger, the failure in the industrial race &#8212; the members of &#8220;Class
        B&#8221; of Mr. Charles Booth&#8217;s hierarchy of social classes &#8212; will
        be no gainers by the change, but will rather find another door closed
        against them, and this in many cases the last door to employment.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I am far from wishing that your Holiness should join in that pharisaical
    denunciation of trades-unions common among those who, while quick to point
    out the injustice of trades-unions in denying to others the equal right to
    work, are themselves supporters of that more primary injustice that denies
    the equal right to the standing-place and natural material necessary to work.
    What I wish to point out is that trades-unionism, while it may be a partial
    palliative, is not a remedy; that it has not that moral character which could
    alone justify one in the position of your Holiness in urging it as good in
    itself. <strong>Yet, so long as you insist on private property in land what better
    can you do? <font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; <strong>while as monopolization goes
    on under the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and
    the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. </strong>Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. <strong>And
    so, when the institution of private property in land had done its work in
    England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing.</strong> In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p><strong>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile.</strong> Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
  <p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the
    community. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
      dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
      globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the
      fear of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their
      quest of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to
      seek it, what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want.
      As the unduly rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying
      quality of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades.
      The real evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and
      unnatural deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes<strong>.
      The existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from
      which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. </strong>Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights we do not
    seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the great fund
      intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy the slightest
      tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not
      only do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we
      see that by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the
      Creator, it is impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without
      at the same time adding to the wealth of the world.</p>
  <p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
    in other wrongs. <strong>Those who defend private property in land, and thereby
    deny the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right to
    the
    material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses. Either
    they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindermost,&#8221; deny
    the equal right to life, and by some theory like that to which the English
    clergyman Malthus has given his name, assert that nature (they do not venture
    to say God) brings into the world more men than there is provision for; or,
    they must, as do the socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are
    wrongs. ...</strong></p>
  <p>Let me again state the case that your Encyclical presents:</p>
  <p>What is that condition of labor which as you truly say is &#8220;the question
    of the hour,&#8221; and &#8220;fills every mind with painful apprehension&#8221;?
    Reduced to its lowest expression it is the poverty of men willing to work.
    And what is the lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8212; for
    in that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
    material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which constitutes
    poverty.</p>
  <p>Now what is the prayer of Christendom &#8212; the universal prayer; the
    prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is honored;
    that ascends from your Holiness at the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s, and
    that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian mother
    has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is, &#8220;Give
    us this day our daily bread!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Yet where this prayer goes up, daily and hourly, men lack bread. Is it not
    the business of religion to say why? If it cannot do so, shall not scoffers
    mock its ministers as Elias mocked the prophets of Baal, saying, &#8220;Cry
    with a louder voice, for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in
    an inn, or on a journey, or perhaps be is asleep, and must be awaked!&#8221; What
    answer can those ministers give? Either there is no God, or he is asleep,
    or else he does give men their daily bread, and it is in some way intercepted.</p>
  <p>Here is the answer, the only true answer: If men lack bread it is not that
    God has not done his part in providing it. If men willing to labor are cursed
    with poverty, it is not that the storehouse that God owes men has failed;
    that the daily supply he has promised for the daily wants of his children
    is not here in abundance. I<strong>t is, that impiously violating the benevolent
    intentions of their Creator, men have made land private property, and thus
    given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a bountiful
    Father has made for all.</strong></p>
  <p>Any other answer than that, no matter how it may be shrouded in the mere
    forms of religion, is practically an atheistical answer. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> IF we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all
  here with an equal title to the enjoyment of His bounty &#8212; with an equal
  right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
  which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human
  being as he enters the world, and which, during his continuance in the world,
  can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
  thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
  make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite
  to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
  who follow them. For what are we but tenants for a day? Have we made the earth
  that we should determine the rights of those who after us shall tenant it in
  their turn? The Almighty, who created the earth for man and man for the earth,
  has entailed it upon all the generations of the children of men by a decree
  written upon the constitution of all things &#8212; a decree which no human
  action can bar and no prescription determine, Let the parchments be ever so
  many, or possession ever so long, natural justice can recognize no right in
  one man to the possession and enjoyment of land that is not equally the right
  of all his fellows. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> HAS the first comer at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs
    and claim that none of the other guests shall partake of the food provided,
    except as they make terms with him? Does the first man who presents a ticket
    at the door of a theater and passes in, acquire by his priority the right
    to shut the doors and have the performance go on for him alone? Does the
    first passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his
    baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after him
    to stand up? <br>
              <br>
  The cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests at a banquet
  continually spread, spectators and participants in an entertainment where there
  is room for all who come; passengers from station to station, on an orb that
  whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess cannot be exclusive;
  they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights of others. Just as the
  passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and his baggage over as many
  seats as he pleases, until other passengers come in, so may a settler take
  and use as much land as he chooses, until it is needed by others &#8212; a
  fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when his right must
  be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation
  can give a right which will bar these equal rights of others. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  NATURE acknowledges no ownership or control in man save as the result of exertion.
  In no other way can her treasures be drawn forth, her powers directed, or her
  forces utilized or controlled. She makes no discriminations among men, but
  is to all absolutely impartial. She knows no distinction between master and
  slave, king and subject, saint and sinner. All men to her stand upon an equal
  footing and have equal rights. She recognizes no claim but that of labor, and
  recognizes that without respect to the claimant. If a pirate spread his sails,
  the wind will fill them as well as it will fill those of a peaceful merchantman
  or missionary bark; if a king and a common man be thrown overboard, neither
  can keep his head above the water except by swimming; birds will not come to
  be shot by the proprietor of the soil any quicker than they will come to be
  shot by the poacher; fish will bite or will not bite at a hook in utter disregard
  as to whether it is offered them by a good little boy who goes to Sunday school,
  or a bad little boy who plays truant; grain will grow only as the ground is
  prepared and the seed is sown; it is only at the call of labor that ore can
  be raised from the mine; the sun shines and the rain falls alike upon just
  and unjust. The laws of nature are the decrees of the Creator. There is written
  in them no recognition of any right save that of labor; and in them is written
  broadly and clearly the equal right of all men to the use and enjoyment of
  nature; to apply to her by their exertions, and to receive and possess her
  reward. Hence, as nature gives only to labor, the exertion of labor in production
  is the only title to exclusive possession. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>PRIVATE property is not of one species, and moral sanction can no more be
    asserted universally of it than of marriage. That proper marriage conforms
    to the law of God does not justify the polygamic or polyandric or incestuous
    marriages that are in some countries permitted by the civil law. And as there
    may be immoral marriage, so may there be immoral private property. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

  THAT any species of property is permitted by the State, does not of itself
  give it moral sanction. The State has often made things property that are not
  justly property but involve violence and robbery. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

    <br>
  TO attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
  justly attaches to things produced by labor, is to impair and deny the true
  rights of property. For a man, who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
  to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
  which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of his
  rightful property, and thus robbed. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

  HOW then is it that we are called deniers of the right of property? It is for
  the same reason that caused nine-tenths of the good people in the United
  States, north as well as south, to regard abolitionists as deniers of the right
  of property; the same reason that made even John Wesley look on a smuggler
  as a kind of robber, and on a custom-house seizer of other men's goods as a
  defender of law and order.&nbsp; Where violations of the right of property
  have been long&nbsp; sanctioned by custom and law, it is inevitable that those
  who really assert the right of property will at first be thought to deny it.&nbsp; For
  under such circumstances the idea of property becomes confused, and that is
  thought to be property which is in reality a violation of property. &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/APP/PIII_C10_The_Right_of_Property_and_the_Right_of_Taxation.htm">A

    ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
  that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
  as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
  Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free
    and independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the
    same time
  also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
  and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
  not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at
    all he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a
    slave as
  in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
  of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

    THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
  do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of
    looking out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense
    of keeping
  them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
  they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
  it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
  the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
  preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

    IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought
    so many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the
    produce
  of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are
    glad to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
  it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
  for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
  when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
  or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need
    to
  be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
  full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
  on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
  of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
  exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

    OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the
    same moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than
    that which
  results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
  under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
  because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
  the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
  . . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
  the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
  are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
  to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
  are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
  for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
    <br>
    To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day
    transpire unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary
    to go
  back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
  or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or sewing machines,
thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows straining and striving
to bring up the little ones deprived of their natural bread-winner; the children
that are growing up in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions
in which only a miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn
them in advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they
die,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>because we permit them to be
robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a system which disinherits the
vast majority of the children that come into the world. There is enough and to
spare for them. Had they the equal rights in the estate which their Creator has
given them, there would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out
a mere existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put
bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we
may see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that are
deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization today. &#8212; <a href="George_TSNS.html">Thou
Shalt Not Steal</a> <br>
</p>
  <p>THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of men are condemned,
    is not the freedom from distraction and temptation which sages have sought
    and philosophers have praised: it is a degrading and embruting slavery, that
    cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer feelings, and drives men by its
    pain to acts which the brutes would refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless
    poverty, that crushes manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood
    of its innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven by a
    force which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The Boston
    collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may commiserate
    their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of competition,
    and cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange is not governed
    by sentiment. And so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who
    receive the earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is
    the inexorable laws of supply and demand, a power with which the individual
    can no more quarrel or dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem
    to press down the lower classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must result in
slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed for all.
. . . Private ownership of land is the nether millstone. Material progress is
the upper millstone. Between them; with an increasing pressure, the working classes
are being ground. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html">Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212;</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html"> Book

  <p> IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in the pressure
    of population against subsistence that an explanation of the unequal development
    of our civilization is to be found. The great cause of inequality in the
    distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership
    of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social,
    the political and, consequently, the intellectual and moral condition of
    a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse
    upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor
    must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products
    of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces
    of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products. On the land
    we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the
    soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

  THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are now perplexing
  the world. It is not that material progress is not in itself a good, it is
  not that nature has called into being children for whom she has failed to provide;
  it is not that the Creator has left on natural laws a taint of injustice at
  which even the human mind revolts, that material progress brings such bitter
  fruits. That amid our highest civilization men faint and die with want is not
  due to the niggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,
  poverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase of population
  and industrial development; they only follow increase of population and industrial
  development because land is treated as private property &#8212; they are the
  direct and necessary results of the violation of the supreme law of justice,
  involved in giving to some men the exclusive possession of that which nature

  <p>IN the Old Testament we are told that, when the Israelites journeyed through
    the desert, they were hungered, and that God sent down out of the heavens &#8212; manna.
    There was enough for all of them, and they all took it and were relieved.
    But, supposing that desert had been held as private property, as the soil
    of Great Britain is held; as the soil even of our new states is being held.
    Supposing that one of the Israelites had a square mile, and another one had
    twenty square miles, and another one had a hundred square miles, and the
    great majority of the Israelites did not have enough to set the soles of
    their feet upon, which they could call their own &#8212; what would become
    of the manna? What good would it have done to the majority? Not a whit. Though
    God had sent down manna enough for all, that manna would have been the property
    of the landholders; they would have employed some of the others, perhaps,
    to gather it up in heaps for them, and would have sold it to the hungry brethren.
    Consider it: this purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until the
    majority of the Israelites had given up all they had, even to the clothes
    off their backs. What then? Well, then they would not have had anything left
    with which to buy manna, and the consequence would have been that while they
    went hungry the manna would be lying in great heaps, and the landowners would
    be complaining about the over-production of manna. There would have been
    a great harvest of manna and hungry people, just precisely the Phenomenon
    that we see today. &#8212; <a href="../../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime of Poverty</a> <br>

PROPERTY in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different from property
in things that are the result of labor. Rob a man or a people of money, or goods,
or cattle, and the robbery is finished there and then. The lapse of time does
not, indeed, change wrong into right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed.
That is done; it is over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away
into the past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing save
omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it we would be
in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever beyond us. We can neither
punish nor recompense the dead. But rob a people of the land on which they must
live, and the robbery is continuous. It is a fresh robbery of every succeeding
generation &#8212; a new robbery every year and every day; it is like the robbery
which condemns to slavery the children of the slave.&nbsp; To apply to it the
statute of limitations, to acknowledge for it the title of prescription, is not
to condone the past; it is to legalese robbery in the present, to justify it
in the future. &#8212; <a href="../../HG/irish_land_question.html">The (Irish) Land Question</a> <br>
AND while in the nature of things any change from wrong-doing to right-doing
must entail loss upon those who profit by the wrong-doing, and this can no more
be prevented than can parallel lines be made to meet; yet it must also be remembered
that in the nature of things the loss is merely relative, the gain absolute.
Whoever will examine the subject will see that in the abandonment of the present
unnatural and unjust method of raising public revenues and the adoption of the
natural and just method even those who relatively lose will be enormous gainers. &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would be hard to
find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while the
general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the capitalist. So
true is this that in common thought the characters are confounded. Thus, to put
all taxes on the value of land, while it would be to largely reduce all great
fortunes, would in no case leave the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster,
who owns a considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest landowner
in the world. To take all his ground rents by taxation would largely reduce his
enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all the income from
them, and doubtless much personal property in various other shapes. He would
still have all he could by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of
society in which to enjoy it. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp093.html"> &#8212; Book

THE existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
society at large suffers and of which the very rich and the very poor are alike
victims, though at the opposite extremes. <br>

Seeing this, it seems to us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of
the rich as though they individually were responsible for the sufferings of the
poor. Yet, while you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and

  <p><font size="-1">Note 56: The ownership of the land is essentially the ownership
      of the men who must use it.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Let the circumstances be what they may &#8212; the ownership of land
    will always give the ownership of men to a degree measured by the necessity
    (real or artificial) for the use of land. Place one hundred men on an island
    from which there is no escape, and whether you make one of these men the
    absolute owner of the other ninety-nine, or the absolute owner of the soil
    of the island, will make no difference either to him or to them.&quot; &#8212; Progress
    and Poverty, book vii, ch. ii.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Let us imagine a shipwrecked sailor who, after battling
      with the waves, touches land upon an uninhabited but fertile island. Though
      hungry and naked
    and shelterless, he soon has food and clothing and a house &#8212; all of
    them rude, to be sure, but comfortable. How does he get them? By applying
    his Labor to the Land of the island. In a little while he lives as comfortably
    as an isolated man can.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Now let another shipwrecked sailor be washed ashore. As he is about to step
    out of the water the first man accosts him:</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Hello, there! If you want to come ashore you must
      agree to be my slave.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The second replies: &quot;I can't. I come from the United
      States, where they don't believe in slavery.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't know you came from
      the United States. I had no intention of hurting your feelings, you know.
      But say, they believe
    in owning land in the United States, don't they?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Very well; you just agree that this island is mine,
      and you may come ashore a free man.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;But how does the island happen to be yours? Did you
      make it?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;No, I didn't make it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Have you a title from its maker?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;No, I haven't any title from its maker.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, what is your title, anyhow?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, my title is good enough. I got here first.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Of course he got there first. But he didn't mean to, and he wouldn't have
    done it if he could have helped it. But the newcomer is satisfied, and says:</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, that's a good United States title, so I guess
      I'll recognize it and come ashore. But remember, I am to be a free man.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you are. Come right along up to my cabin.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">For a time the two get along well enough together. But on
      some fine morning the proprietor concludes that he would rather lie abed
      than scurry around
    for his breakfast and not being in a good humor, perhaps, he somewhat roughly
    commands his &quot;brother man&quot; to cook him a bird.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;What?&quot; exclaims the brother.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;I tell you to go and kill a bird and cook it for my
      breakfast.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;That sounds big,&quot; sneers the second free and equal member of
    the little community; &quot;but what am I to get for doing this?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh,&quot; the first replies languidly, &quot;if you
      kill me a fat bird and cook it nicely, then after I have had my breakfast
      off the bird
    you may cook the gizzard for your own breakfast. That's pay enough. The work
    is easy.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;But I want you to understand that I am not your slave,
      and I won't do that work for that pay. I'll do as much work for you as
      you do for me,
    and no more.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then, sir,&quot; the first comer shouts in virtuous wrath, &quot;I
    want you to understand that my charity is at an end. I have treated you better
    than you deserved in the past, and this is your gratitude. Now I don't propose
    to have any loafers on my property. You will work for the wages I offer or
    get off my land! You are perfectly free. Take the wages or leave them. Do
    the work or let it alone. There is no slavery here. But if you are not satisfied
    with my terms, leave my island!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The second man, if accustomed to the usages of the labor
      unions, would probably go out and, to the music of his own violent language
      about the &quot;greed
    of capital,&quot; destroy as many bows and arrows as he could, so as to paralyze
    the bird-shooting industry; and this proceeding he would call a strike for
    honest wages and the dignity of labor. If he were accustomed to social reform
    notions of the namby-pamby variety, he would propose an arbitration, and
    be mildly indignant when told that there was nothing to arbitrate &#8212; that
    he had only to accept the other's offer or get off his property. But if a
    sensible man, he would notify his comrade that the privilege of owning islands
    in that latitude had expired.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Note 57: While in the Pennsylvania coal regions a few years
      ago I was told of an incident that illustrates the power of perpetuating
      poverty which resides
    in the absolute ownership of land.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The miners were in poverty. Despite the lavish protection bestowed upon
    them by tariff laws at the solicitation of monopolies which dictate our tariff
    policy, the men were afflicted with poverty in many forms. They were poor
    as to clothing, poor as to shelter, poor as to food, and to be more specific,
    they were in extreme poverty as to ice. When the summer months came they
    lacked this thing because they could not afford to buy, and they suffered.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Owing to the undermining of the ground and the caving in
      of the surface here and there, there were great holes into which the snow
      and the rain fell
    in winter and froze, forming a passable quality of ice. Now it is frequently
    said that intelligence, industry, and thrift will abolish poverty. But these
    virtues were not successful among the men of whom I speak. They were intelligent
    enough to see that this ice if they saved it would abolish their poverty
    as to ice, and they were industrious enough and thrifty enough not only to
    be willing to save it, but actually to begin the work. Preparing little caves
    to preserve the ice in, they went into the holes after a long day's work
    in the mines, and gathered what so far as the need of ice was concerned was
    to abolish their poverty in the ensuing summer. But the owner of this part
    of the earth &#8212; a man who had neither made the earth, nor the rain,
    nor the snow, nor the ice, nor even the hole &#8212; telegraphed his agent
    forbidding the removal of ice except upon payment of a certain sum per ton.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The miners couldn't afford the condition. They controlled
      the necessary Labor, and were willing to give it to abolish their poverty;
      but the Land
    was placed beyond their reach by an owner, and in consequence of that, and
    not from any lack of intelligence, industry, or thrift on their own part,
    their poverty as to ice was perpetuated. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></font></p>
  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">It is only custom that makes the ownership of land seem
        reasonable. I have frequently had occasion to tell of the necessity under
        which the city of Cleveland, Ohio, found itself, of paying a land-owner
        several thousand dollars for the right to swing a bridge-draw over his
        land. When I described the matter in that way, the story attracted no
        attention; it seemed perfectly reasonable to the ordinary lecture audience.
        But when I described the transaction as a payment by the city to a land-owner
        of thousands of dollars for the privilege of swinging the draw &quot;through
        that man's air,&quot; the audience invariably manifested its appreciation
        of the absurdity of such an ownership. The idea of owning air was ridiculous;
        the idea of owning land was not. Yet who can explain the difference,
        except as a matter of custom?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">To the same effect was the question of the Rev. F. L.
        Higgins to a friend. While stationed at Galveston, Tex., Mr. Higgins
        fell into a discussion with his friend as to the right of government
        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Suppose,&quot; said Mr. Higgins, &quot;that the
        government should vest in a corporation title to the Gulf of Mexico,
        so that no one could fish there, or sail there, or do anything in or
        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.
        Would that be right?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, suppose the corporation should then parcel
        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Could private titles to the Gulf possibly become
        absolute in morals?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then tell me,&quot; asked Mr. Higgins, &quot;what
        difference it would make if all the water were taken off the Gulf and
        only the bare land left.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single
    Tax. 110</p>

  <p><em>Q32. Is not ownership of land necessary to induce its improvement? Does
      not history show that private ownership is a step in advance of common
      ownership?</em><br>
A. No. Private use was doubtless a step in advance of common use. And because
private use seems to us to have been brought about under the institution of private
ownership, private ownership appears to the superficial to have been the real
advance. But a little observation and reflection will remove that impression.
Private ownership of land is not necessary to its private use. And so far from
inducing improvement, private ownership retards it. When a man owns land he may
accumulate wealth by doing nothing with the land, simply allowing the community
to increase its value while he pays a merely nominal tax, upon the plea that
he gets no income from the property. But when the possessor has to pay the value
of his land every year, as he would have to under the single tax, and as ground
renters do now, he must improve his holding in order to profit by it. Private
possession of land, without profit except from use, promotes improvement; private
ownership, with profit regardless of use, retards improvement. Every city in
the world, in its vacant lots, offers proof of the statement. It is the lots
that are owned, and not those that are held upon ground-lease, that remain vacant.<strong></strong></p>
  <p><em>Q52. Is not the right of ownership of a gold ring the same as the ownership
      of a gold mine? and if the latter is wrong is not the former also wrong?</em><br>
A. If it be wrong for you to own the spring of water which you and your fellows
use, is it therefore wrong for you to own the water that you lift from the spring
to drink? If so how do you propose to slake your thirst? If you argue in reply
that it is not wrong for you to own the spring, then how shall your fellows slake
their thirst when you treat them, as you would have a right to, as trespassers
upon your property? To own the source of labor products is to own the labor of
others; to own what you produce from that source is to own only your own labor.
Nature furnishes gold mines, but men fashion gold rings. The right of ownership
is radically different.</p>
  <p><em>Q62. If the ownership of land is immoral is it not the duty of individuals
      who see its immorality to refrain from profiting by it?</em><br>
A. No. The immorality is institutional, not individual. Every member of a community
has a right to land and an interest in the rent of land. Under the single tax
both rights would be conserved. But under existing social institutions the only
way of securing either is to own land and profit by it. To refrain from doing
so would have no reformatory effect. It is one of the eccentricities of narrow
minds to believe or profess to believe that institutional wrongs and individual
wrongs are upon the same plane and must be cured in the same way &#8212; by individual
reformation. But individuals cannot change institutions by refraining from profiting
by them, any more than they could dredge a creek by refraining from swimming
in it. Institutional wrongs must be remedied by institutional reforms. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>
