<blockquote>
  <p align="left">How do we divide the fruits of production? Take a look at <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/isms.htm">http://www.henrygeorge.org/isms.htm</a> for
    four graphics which illustrate clearly the &quot;left-wing,&quot; &quot;right-wing,&quot; and &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; approaches,
  and the Georgist proposal. </p>
  <p>Why would we <em>ever</em> want to place our taxes on wages? If taxes on
    land value &#8212; urban land in particular, but also valuable natural resources and other like things (see &quot;<a href="../Land_includes.htm">land includes</a>&quot;) 
    &#8212; are insufficient to meet all our revenue needs, then perhaps we must
    <em>supplement</em> taxes on land value with taxes on wages, but we shouldn't employ
    that <em>second</em> choice until we've completely exhausted the <em>better</em> choice of
    tax base.</p>
  <p>An income tax is a clumsy tool for collecting economic rent; it vacuums up many other kinds of income which ought not to be taxed, and, as we use it now, fails to collect economic rent (e.g., through such provisions as excluding a significant chunk of so-called &quot;capital&quot; gains -- mostly gains on land value -- from taxation, or through 1031 exchanges, to cite two examples).</p>

Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
    entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such
    relations as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment
    of the results. <strong>There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving
    its validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things
    produced
    by labor &#8212; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to
    deprive him without his will is theft.</strong></p>
  <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
    is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
    by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
  <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
    in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But
    he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may
    sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
    such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
    in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
    labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
    sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
    the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use,
    but none may claim as his alone.</p>
  <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
    justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
    rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
    to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
    which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of
    his rightful property and thus robbed. ... <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
        Ultimate Tax Reform:
  Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. tax system is widely perceived as too complex, too intrusive, and
    too demanding of workers&#8217; paychecks. Taxes today claim a greater share
    of the average family&#8217;s budget than food, clothing, housing, and transportation
    combined.1 In 2005, the average American had to work 107 days just to pay
    taxes, compared to 44 days in 1930.2</p>
  <p>Tax reform proposals, not surprisingly, are popular among voters and the politicians
    who represent them. President George W. Bush created an advisory panel on tax
    reform. Some economists and institutes have proposed reforms to <strong>flatten
    and simplify the income tax,</strong> or to replace it entirely with a national sales or
    consumption tax or value-added tax.</p>
  <p>These would be an improvement, but if we seek to reform taxes, we should
    consider all the possibilities and choose, as Milton Friedman puts it, the &#8220;least
    bad&#8221; tax. </p>
  <p>Even a relatively flat income tax imposes what economists call a &#8220;deadweight
    loss&#8221; or &#8220;excess burden&#8221; on society. Taxes on productive
    activity increase the price of labor or goods beyond economic costs, and
    so reduce the quantity provided. This reduction in production, income, and
    investment
    is a misallocation of resources. Resources are wasted because they do not
    go to where they are most wanted. We can reduce this excess burden by reducing
    taxes, but changing the type of tax can also reduce this deadweight loss.
    Economists
    recognize that if we tap for public revenue a resource whose quantity is
    fixed, the excess burden disappears. The tax does not reduce the supply and
    does not
  increase prices. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>It is widely understood that when something is taxed, we get less of it.
    As discussed above, this reduction in labor, production, and investment is
    called
    the &#8220;excess burden&#8221; or &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; of taxation.
    Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes discourage
    consumption, capital gains taxes discourage investment, and real property
    taxes discourage
    building and improving property. Those taxes make the asset or activity more
    costly, which then reduces the
  quantity bought of the thing being taxed. <br>
  <br>
  What makes land different is that its supply is fixed, and it is independent
  of human action. When land value or rent is tapped for public revenue, the land
  does not shrink, flee, or hide. ...</p>
  <p>Income taxes impose on the economy a large administrative cost by government
    and a cost to payers of filling out forms, paying lawyers and accountants,
    and trying to comprehend the complex requirements. The compliance cost of lost
    time in the U.S. is 5 billion hours per year, the equivalent of two million
    people working full time just to process the income tax. In dollar terms, the
    compliance cost is estimated to be
  more than $200 billion per year.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small><br>
  <br>
  Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware of the
  substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed, is often why such
  reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to discourage borrowing, reduce consumption,
  or encourage savings, for example. But moving to a national retail sales tax
  results in little
  improvement.<br>
  <br>
  Most people use their wage income to pay for goods and services and sales taxes.
  Switching from an income to a sales tax is like taxing you when you leave a room
  instead of when you enter the room.<br>
  <br>
  Income taxes punish savings, but sales taxes punish borrowing. If you borrow
  $10,000 to buy a car and there is a 20 percent sales tax, you need to borrow
  an extra $2,000 to pay the tax. Some folks might decide to not buy the car, spending
  the $10,000 on something else, without
  borrowing $2,000. ...</p>
  <p>Consider the effect of abolishing income taxes and sales taxes, replacing
    them with a land value tax. There would no longer be any tax audits. There
    would be no record-keeping for taxes. You, the landowner, would instead get
    a monthly bill, like you get for utilities. You would simply pay the bill or
    have it automatically deducted from some financial account. At the same time,
    government would avoid the high cost of processing complex accounts and keeping
    individual tax records. It would only need to keep real estate records and
    assess the land
  values, both of which it already does for property tax purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Those who are retired or temporarily have little cash income would be able to
  defer taxes by accumulating liens on the real estate until they die or sell the
  property, as is commonly done today with real estate
  taxes. </p>
  <p>If you thought the assessment of the land value was too high, you could
    appeal, as one can today&#8217;s real estate taxes. The land value assessments would
    be public records available on the Internet, unlike income tax records, which
    are quite properly hidden from public view. You could easily compare your assessment
    with those of your neighbors. If the appeals board rejected your claim, the
    assessment could be appealed to a jury, if you were willing to pay the cost
    of the jury&#8217;s
  decision.<br>
  <br>
  Nobody would be sent to prison for tax evasion, because there would be no tax
  evasion. A non-payer would lose title to his land or lose the protective services
  of government, depending on the local enforcement practice. Property taxes
  are already being assessed and collected by counties in the U.S. A complete
  shift
  to the taxation of land values would not increase these costs, but would eliminate
  the expenses
  involved in collecting sales and income taxes. ...</p>
  <p>The national rent in the United Kingdom has been estimated at 22 percent
    of national income, which exceeds the amount
  raised in that&nbsp; country by the income tax.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span></small>Steven
  Cord<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small> estimated
  the annual economic rent of land in the U.S. in 1986 at $680 billion, 20 percent
  of national income, while Mike Miles (1990) arrived at a similar figure using
  data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small> The totals
  include government lands but do not include the increase in geo-rent that would
  occur with the elimination of market-hampering
  taxes.</p>
  <p>Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation would provide
    about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local government revenue,
    which would be more than adequate for government spending if it did not include
    transfer payments. The taxable value of the land in the economy would increase
    over time for two reasons.
  ...</p>
  <p>An ideal public revenue policy respects a person&#8217;s right to privacy,
    does not discourage work or savings, and does not induce dishonesty. While
    income, sales, and value-added taxes fall woefully short of this ideal, land
    value taxation meets each requirement.<br>
    <br>
  Imagine the increased prosperity and opportunities for advancement that would
  exist if people could keep all of the money they earn; if billions of dollars
  wasted on efforts to avoid high income taxes were suddenly turned to productive
  endeavors; and if the growth of government were constrained by a tax system
  that would raise only
  enough to pay for services actually provided. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Impact on behavior</strong></p>
  <p>Income taxes impose on the economy a large administrative cost by government
    and a cost to payers of filling out forms, paying lawyers and accountants,
    and trying to comprehend the complex requirements. The compliance cost of
    lost time in the U.S. is 5 billion hours per year, the equivalent of two
    million people working full time just to process the income tax. In dollar
    terms, the compliance cost is estimated to be more than $200 billion per
    year.29</p>
  <p>Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware
    of the substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed, is
    often why such reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to discourage borrowing,

    spending the $10,000 on something else, without borrowing $2,000.</p>
  <p>There is no good economic reason to tax-punish consumption or borrowing.
    The purpose of production is consumption! If we punish consumption, we punish
    production. Consumption is not an evil to be thwarted, but the very benefit
    we get from the economy. We may as well also tax fun and joy! Those seeking
    to tax consumption act as though they have a Puritan streak that considers
    enjoying goods to be evil and working and saving to be good for their own
    sake. ... <a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

<p>Alanna Hartzok: <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">Who Would Jesus Tax? The
    Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
    for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
    Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
    church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
    incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
    while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less than
    $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been
    no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country.
    Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
    scene.<br>
        <br>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a design
  of a tax structure this bad," she said in a <em>Tuscaloosa News</em>story last
  February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust and has no moral,
  ethical leg to stand on. Period."<br>
    <br>
    Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes in
    state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just 4.1 percent.
    Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of property taxes, with
    homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes are among the highest in
    the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas, and do not exempt even the most
    basic necessities such as food. The state's 1901 constitution was written primarily
    by large landholders to secure their economic interests, consequently property
    taxes are extremely light on their holdings. ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read the whole article</a></p>
