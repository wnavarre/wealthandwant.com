<blockquote>
                <p>MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend
                            to advance in proportion to the mental power expended
                            in progression &#8212; the
                            mental power which is devoted to the extension of
                            knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
                    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book
                    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</a><br>
                  <br>
                  To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress
                            through the water will not depend upon the exertion
                            of her
                            crew, but upon
                            the exertion devoted to propelling her.
                This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for
                            baling, or any expenditure of force in fighting among
                            themselves
                            or in pulling
                            in different
                directions. <br>
                <br>
                Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
                existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
                of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
                which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the first
                essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
                association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater the possibilities
                of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict becomes
                greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an equality of rights
                is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice) is the second essential of
                progress. <br>
                <br>
                Thus association in equality is the law of progress.
                            Association frees mental power for expenditure in
                            improvement, and
                            equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
                the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the
                            moral law) prevents the dissipation of this power
                            in fruitless
                            struggles. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

                THE law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
                as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge
                the equality
            of right between man and man, just as they insure to each the perfect
            liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of every other,
            must
            civilization advance. Just as they fail in this, must advancing
            civilization come to a halt and recede. Political economy and social
            science cannot teach any lessons that are not embraced in the simple
            truths that were taught to poor fishermen and Jewish peasants by
          One who eighteen hundred years ago was crucified &#8212; the simple
          truths which, beneath the warpings of selfishness and the distortions
          of superstition, seem to underlie every religion that has ever striven
          to formulate the spiritual yearnings of man. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

                <p>THE poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes
                  men, and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring
                  from a denial of justice. In permitting the monopolization
                  of the opportunities which nature freely offers to all, we
                  have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for, so
                  far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale,
                  justice seems to be the supreme law of the universe. But by
                  sweeping away this injustice and asserting the rights of all
                  men to natural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves to
                  the law &#8212; we shall remove the great cause of unnatural
                  inequality in the distribution of wealth and power; we shall
                  abolish poverty; tame the ruthless passions of greed; dry up
                  the springs of vice and misery; light in dark places the lamp
                  of knowledge; give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse
                  to discovery; substitute political strength for political weakness;
                  and make tyranny and anarchy impossible.&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html"> &#8212; Book

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to Henry
George</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations
    of the world as still progressing; all others had either petrified or had
    vanished. And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences
    of corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create civilization
    and the forces that destroy it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to progress to be
    the desires inherent in human nature, and the motor of progress to be what
    he called mental power. But the mental power that is available for progress
    is only what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These demands
    George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive man's powers
    are required simply to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate
    in communities and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free
    for higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress: </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of mental
    power in conflict becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords
    to each an equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
    is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is the law
    of progress. Association frees mental power for expenditure in improvement,
    and equality, or justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same
    thing, the recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
    power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his analysis
    of civilization in these words: "The law of human progress, what is it but
    the moral law? Just as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge
    the equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each the
    perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of every other,
    must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this, must advancing civilization
    come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation of man
    is to the earth, so must the primary social adjustment concern the relation
    of man to the earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind
    equal access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will promote
    justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man, and insure perfect
    liberty to each. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was what the
    single tax would do. It was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal
    reform but as the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the
    long run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose sight
    of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we recognize
    it." ... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
