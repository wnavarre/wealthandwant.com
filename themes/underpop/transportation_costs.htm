<blockquote>
  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
    of vastly more
concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe
        manufacturers, enters into manufacturers' prices, and, together with
        the usual rate of profit upon that amount of investment, is recovered
        from wholesalers. The tax and the manufacturers' profit upon it then
        constitute part of the wholesale price and are collected from retailers.
        The retailers in turn collect the tax with all intermediate profits upon
        it, together with their usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final
        purchasers &#8212; the consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface
        to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an
        indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of profits
        upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather
        output were imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather
        the amount of the tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment,
        and collect the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation,
        of tanning and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect
        with their profit from retailers, who would collect with their profit
        from shoe consumers. The principle applies also when taxes are levied
        upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or the money or credits of
        bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual profit to the prices of
        their goods, and bankers add it to their interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000; at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would
        cost retailers $121,000, and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would
        finally impose a tax burden of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more
        than the government would get. Upon most commodities the number of profits
        exceeds three, so that indirect taxes may frequently cost as much as
        100 per cent, even when imposed only upon what are commercially known
        as finished goods; when imposed upon materials also, the cost of collection
        might well run far above 200 percent in addition to the first cost of
        maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of
        indirect taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary.
        When shoe manufacturers, or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices,
        or bankers add them to interest, it is not because they might do otherwise
        but choose to do this; it is because the exigencies of trade compel them.
        Manufacturers, merchants, and other tradesmen who carry on competitive
        businesses must on the average sell their goods at cost plus the ordinary
        rate of profit, or go out of business. It follows that any increase in
        cost of production tends to increase the price of products. Now, a tax
        upon the output of business men, which they must pay as a condition of
        doing their business, is as truly part of the cost of their output as
        is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of the men they hire.
        Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase the price of
        their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as the tax is
        more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
                                                  such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
                                                  copyright publications is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly
                                                  manufacturer whose prices are not checked by cost of production, and
                                                  are therefore as a rule higher than competitive prices would be, may
                                                  find it more profitable to bear the burden of a tax that leaves him some
                                                  profit, by preserving his entire custom, than to drive off part of his
                                                  custom by adding the tax to his usual prices. <strong>This
                                                  is true also of a moderate
                                                  import tax to the extent it
                                                  falls upon goods that are more
                                                  cheaply
                                                  transported from the place
                                                  of production to a foreign
                                                  market where the import tax
                                                  is imposed than to a home market
                                                  where the goods would be
                                                  free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance, of a farm in Canada
                                                  near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian town.</strong> If the
                                                  tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation the producer
                                                  will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate effect
                                                  would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
                                                  may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
                                                  will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
                                                  cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">9. &quot;To collect taxes, to prevent and punish evasions,
        to check and countercheck revenue drawn from so many distinct sources,
        now make up probably three-fourths, perhaps seven-eighths, of the business
        of government outside of the preservation of order, the maintenance of
        the military arm, and the administration of justice.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch: v</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">10. For a brief and thorough exposition of indirect taxation
        read George's <em>&quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; ch. viii, on &quot; Tariffs
        for Revenue.&quot;</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>
