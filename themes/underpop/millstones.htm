<p align="center">upper, nether, grinding some, and weighing us down</p>
<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry
George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> OR let him go to Edinburgh, the &quot;modern Athens,&quot; of which Scotsmen
    speak with pride, and in buildings from whose roofs a bowman might strike
    the spires of twenty churches he will find human beings living as he would
    not keep his meanest dog. Let him toil up the stairs of one of those monstrous
    buildings, let him enter one of those &quot;dark houses,&quot; let him close
    the door, and in the blackness think what life must be in such a place. Then
    let him try the reduction to iniquity. And if he go to that good charity
    (but, alas! how futile is Charity without Justice!) where little children
    are kept while their mothers are at work, and children are fed who would
    otherwise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs are shrunken from want
    of nourishment. Perhaps they may tell him, as they told me, of that little
    girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who, when they gave her bread, raised
    her eyes and clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Heaven for His
    bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think, of its terrible
    meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, <strong>did that little child, thankful
    for that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard?
    If
    not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
    bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
    to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths
    of the sea?</strong> &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll),
  The Nineteenth Century, July, 1884</p>
  <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries
    we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we
    take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization large
    classes should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority
    should only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toil. There are
    professors of political economy who teach that this condition of things is
    the result of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are ministers
    of religion who preach that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful
    Creator intended for His children! If an architect were to build a theater
    so that not more than one-tenth of the audience could see and hear, we should
    call him a bungler and a botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide
    so little food that nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should
    call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even
    the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great Architect
    of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature testifies, has made such
    a botch job of this world that the vast majority of the human creatures whom
    He has called into it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want,
    suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development
    of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely
    live! &#8212; Social Problems </p>

    Work is Scarce, Wages Low and Labour Restless (1877, San Francisco) ...</p>
  <p>THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of men are condemned,
    is not the freedom from distraction and temptation which sages have sought
    and philosophers have praised: it is a degrading and embruting slavery, that
    cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer feelings, and drives men by its
    pain to acts which the brutes would refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless
    poverty, that crushes manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood
    of its innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven by a
    force which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The Boston
    collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may commiserate
    their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of competition,
    and cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange is not governed
    by sentiment. And so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who
    receive the earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is
    the inexorable laws of supply and demand, a power with which the individual
    can no more quarrel or dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem
    to press down the lower classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must result in
slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed for all.
