<blockquote>
  <p>Production includes distribution. And services, be they rendered by highly
    educated and trained professionals or people who have not completed high
    school, are
      part of production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <em><a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">Progress &amp; Poverty:</a></em><a href="HG/PP/01_introductory_the_problem.htm"> The
Current Doctrine of Wages &#8212; Its Insufficiency</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><B>But the fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly
        grasped, and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed
      form is but an elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and that
      principles
        obvious in the simpler relations of men are merely disguised and not
      abrogated or reversed by the more intricate relations that result from
      the division
        of labor and the use of complex tools and methods. The steam grist mill,
        with its complicated machinery exhibiting every diversity of motion,
      is simply what the rude stone mortar dug up from an ancient river bed was
      in
    its day &#8212; an instrument for grinding corn. And every man engaged in
    it, whether tossing wood into the furnace, running the engine, dressing stones,
    printing
    sacks or keeping books, is really devoting his labor to the same purpose
    that the prehistoric savage did when he
    used his mortar &#8212; the preparation of grain for human food.</B></p>
  <p>And so, if we reduce to their lowest terms all the complex operations of
    modern production, we see that each individual who takes part in this infinitely
    subdivided
      and intricate network of production and exchange is really doing what the
    primeval man did when he climbed the trees for fruit or followed the receding
    tide for
      shellfish &#8212;<B><I> endeavoring to obtain from nature by the exertion
      of his powers the satisfaction of his desires</I></B>. If we keep this
      firmly in mind, if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as the co-operation
      of all embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various desires
      of each, we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions
      comes as
      truly and as directly from nature as the result of that exertion, as did
      that of the first man.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: in the simplest state of which we can conceive, each man digs
    his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantages of the <A NAME="division of labor"></A><B>division
    of labor</B> soon become apparent, and one digs bait while the others fish.
    Yet evidently the one who digs bait is in reality doing as much toward the
    catching of fish as any of those who actually take the fish. So when the advantages
    of canoes are discovered, and instead of all going a-fishing, one stays behind
    and makes and repairs canoes, the canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor
    to the taking of fish as much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he
    eats at night when the fishermen come home are as truly the product of his
    labor as of theirs. And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated,
    and instead of each attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct resort
    to nature, one fishes, another hunts, a third picks berries, a fourth gathers
    fruit, a fifth makes tools, a sixth builds huts, and a seventh prepares clothing
    -- each one is to the extent he exchanges the direct product of his own labor
    for the direct product of the labor of others really applying his own labor
    to the production of the things be uses -- is in effect satisfying his particular
    desires by the exertion of his particular powers; that is to say, what be receives
    be in reality produces. If he digs roots and exchanges them for venison, he
    is in effect as truly the procurer of the venison as though be had gone in
    chase of the deer and left the huntsman to dig his own roots. <B>The common
    expression, "I made so and so," signifying "I earned so and so," or "I earned
    money with which I purchased so and so," is, economically speaking, not metaphorically
    but literally true. Earning is making.</B></p>
  <p>Now, if we follow these principles, obvious enough in a simpler state of society,
    through the complexities of the state we call civilized, we shall see clearly
    that in every case in which labor is exchanged for commodities, production
    really precedes enjoyment; that wages are the earnings -- that is to say, the
    makings of labor &#8212; not the advances of capital, and that the laborer
    who receives his wages in money (coined or printed, it may be, before his
    labor commenced)
    really receives in return for the addition his labor has made to the general
    stock of wealth, a draft upon that general stock, which he may utilize in
    any particular form of wealth that will best satisfy his desires; and that
    neither
    the money, which is but the draft, nor the particular form of wealth which
    he uses it to call for, represents advances of capital for his maintenance,
    but on the contrary represents the wealth, or a portion of the wealth, his
    labor has already added to the general stock.</p>
  <p>Keeping these principles in view we see that </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the draughtsman, who, shut up in some dingy office on the banks of the
          Thames, is drawing the plans for a great marine engine, is in reality
      devoting his labor to the production of bread and meat as truly as though
      he were
          garnering the grain in California or swinging a lariat on a La Plata
      pampa; that he is as truly making his own clothing as though he were shearing
      sheep
          in Australia or weaving cloth in Paisley, and just as effectually producing
          the claret he drinks at dinner as though he gathered the grapes on
      the banks of the Garonne. </li>
    <li>The miner who, two thousand feet under ground in the heart of the Comstock,
          is digging out silver ore, is, in effect, by virtue of a thousand exchanges,
          harvesting crops in valleys five thousand feet nearer the earth's center;
          chasing the whale through Arctic icefields; plucking tobacco leaves
      in Virginia; picking coffee berries in Honduras; cutting sugar cane on
      the Hawaiian Islands;
          gathering cotton in Georgia or weaving it in Manchester or Lowell;
      making quaint wooden toys for his children in the Hartz Mountains; or plucking
      amid
          the green and gold of Los Angeles orchards the oranges which, when
      his shift is relieved, he will take home to his sick wife. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The wages which he receives on Saturday night at the mouth of the shaft, what
    are they but the certificate to all the world that he has done these things
    -- the primary exchange in the long series which transmutes his labor into
    the things he has really been laboring for? ... <a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">read the entire chapter </a></p>

  the power of relating cause and effect, man is among all animals the only producer
  in the true sense of the term. . . . But the same quality of reason which makes
  him the producer, also, wherever exchange becomes possible, makes him the exchanger.
  And it is along this line of exchanging that the body economic is evolved and
  develops, and that all the advances of civilization are primarily made. . .
  . With the beginning of exchange or trade among men this body economic begins
  to form, and in its beginning civilization begins. . . . To find an utterly
  uncivilized people, we must find a people among whom there is no exchange or
  trade. Such a people does not exist, and, as far as our knowledge goes, never
  did. To find a fully civilized people, we must find a people among whom exchange
  or trade is absolutely free, and has reached the fullest development to which
  human desires can carry it. There is, as yet, unfortunately, no such people. &#8212; <em>The

WHEN we, come to analyze production, we find it to fall into three modes, viz:: <br>
ADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so as to fit
them for the satisfaction of human desire. <br>
GROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising vegetables or
animals. <br>
EXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth, the higher
powers of those natural forces which vary with locality, or of those human forces
which vary with situation, occupation, or character. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
THESE modes seem to appear and to assume importance, in the development of human
society, much in the order here given. They originate from the increase of the
desires of men with the increase of the means of satisfying them, under pressure
of the fundamental law of political economy, that men seek to satisfy their desires
with the least exertion. In the primitive stage of human life the readiest way
of satisfying desires is by adapting to human use what is found in existence.
In a later and more settled stage it is discovered that certain desires can be
more easily and more fully satisfied by utilizing the principle of growth and
reproduction, as by cultivating vegetables and breeding animals. And in a still
later period of development, it becomes obvious that certain desires can be better
and more easily satisfied by exchange, which brings out the principle of co-operation
more fully and powerfully than could obtain among unexchanging economic units. &#8212; <em>The

Part III, Chapter 2, The Production of Wealth: The Three Modes of Production</a></p>
  <p>IN the economic meaning of the term production, the transporter or exchanger,
    or anyone engaged in any subdivision of those functions, is as truly engaged
    in production as is the primary extractor or maker. A newspaper-carrier or
    the keeper of a news-stand would, for instance, in common speech be styled
    a distributor. But in economic terminology he is not a distributor of wealth,
    but a producer of wealth. Although his part in the process of producing the
    newspaper to the final receiver comes last, not first, he is as much a producer
    as the paper-maker or type-founder, the editor, or compositor, or press-man.
    For the object of production is the satisfaction of human desires, that is
    to say, it is consumption; and this object is not made capable of attainment,
    that is to say, production is not really complete, until wealth is brought
    to the place where it is to be consumed and put at the disposal of him whose
    desire it is to satisfy.&nbsp; &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe301.html">unabridged:

PRODUCTION and distribution are not separate things, but two mentally distinguishable
parts of one thing &#8212; the exertion of human labor in the satisfaction of
human desire. Though materially distinguishable, they are as closely related
as the two arms of the syphon. And as it is the outflow of water at the longer
end of the syphon that is the cause of the inflow of water at the shorter end,
so it is that distribution is really the cause of production, not production
the cause of distribution. In the ordinary course, things are not distributed
because they have been produced, but are produced in order that they may be distributed.
Thus interference with the distribution of wealth is interference with the production
of wealth, and shows its effect in lessened production. &#8212; <em>The Science

          <br>
OUR inquiry into the laws of the distribution of wealth is not an inquiry into
the municipal laws or human enactments which either here and now, or in any other
time and place, prescribe or have prescribed how wealth shall be divided among
men. With them we have no concern, unless it may be for purposes of illustration.
What we have to seek are those laws of the distribution of wealth which belong
to the natural order &#8212; laws which are a part of that system or arrangement
which constitutes the social organism or body economic, as distinguished from
the body politic or state, the Greater Leviathan which makes its appearance with
civilization and develops with its advance. These natural laws are in all times
and places the same, and though they may be crossed by human enactment, can never
be annulled or swerved by it. It is more needful to call this to mind, because,
in what have passed for systematic treatises on political economy, the fact that
it is with natural laws, not human laws, that the science of political economy
is concerned, has, in treating of the distribution of wealth, been utterly ignored,
and even flatly denied. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe401.html">unabridged:

          </a><br>
THE distinction between the laws of production and the laws of distribution is
not, as is erroneously taught in the scholastic political economy, that the one
set of laws are natural laws and the other human laws. Both sets of laws are
laws of nature. The real distinction is that the natural laws of pro<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>duction
are physical laws and the natural laws of distribution are moral laws. . . .
The moment we turn from a consideration of the laws of the production of wealth
to a consideration of the laws of the distribution of wealth, the idea of ought
or duty becomes primary. All consideration of distribution involves the ethical
principle, is necessarily a consideration of ought or duty &#8212; a consideration
in which the idea of right or justice is from the very first involved. &#8212; <em>The

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-operation &#8212; its
      Two Modes </span><br>
        <br>
ALL increase in the productive power of man over that with which nature endows
the individual comes from the co-operation of individuals. But there are two
ways in which this co-operation may take place. 1. By the combination of effort.
In this way individuals may accomplish what exceeds the full power of the individual.
2. By the separation of effort. In this way the individual may accomplish for
more than one what does not require the full power of the individual. . . . To
illustrate: The first way of co-operation, the combination of labor, enables
a number of men to remove a rock or to raise a log that would be too heavy for
them separately. In this way men conjoin themselves, as it were, into one stronger
man. Or, to take an example so common in the early days of American settlement
that "log-rolling" has become a term for legislative combination: Tom, Dick,
Harry and Jim are building near each other their rude houses in the clearings.
Each hews his own trees, but the logs are too heavy for one man to get into place.
So the four unite their efforts, first rolling one man's logs into place and
then another's, until, the logs of all four having been placed, the result is
the same as if each had been enabled to concentrate into one time the force he
could exert in four different times. . . . But, while great advantages result
from the ability of individuals, by the combination of labor to concentrate themselves,
as it were, into one larger man, there are other times and other things in which
an individual could accomplish more if he could divide himself, as it were, into
a number of smaller men. . . . What the division of labor does, is to permit
men, as it were, so to divide themselves, thus enormously increasing their total
effectiveness. To illustrate from the example used before: While at times Tom,
Dick, Harry and Jim might each wish to move logs, at other times they might each
need to get something from a village distant two days' journey. To satisfy this
need individually would thus require two days' effort on the part of each. But
if Tom alone goes, performing the errands for all, and the others each do half
a days' work for him, the result is that all get at the expense of half a day's
effort on the part of each what otherwise would have required two days' effort. &#8212; <em>The

          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Co-operation &#8212; its Two Kinds </span><br>
          <br>
WE have seen that there are two ways or modes in which co-operation increases
productive power. If we ask how co-operation is itself brought about, we see
that there is in this also a distinction, and that co-operation is of two essentially
different kinds. . .. There is one kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were,
from without, which results from the conscious direction of a controlling will
to a definite end. This we may call directed or conscious co-operation. There
is another kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were, from within, which results
from a correlation in the actions of independent wills, each seeking but its
own immediate purpose, and careless, if not indeed ignorant, of the general result.
This we may call spontaneous or unconscious co-operation. The movement of a great
army is a good type of co-operation of the one kind. Here the actions of many
individuals are subordinated to, and directed by, one conscious will, they becoming,
as it were, its body and executing its thought. The providing of a great city
with all the manifold things which are constantly needed by its inhabitants is
a good type of co-operation of the other kind. This kind of co-operation is far
wider, far finer, far more strongly and delicately organized, than the kind of
co-operation involved in the movements of an army, yet it is brought about not
by subordination to the direction of one conscious will, which knows the general
result at which it aims, but by the correlation of actions originating in many
independent wills, each aiming at its own small purpose without care for, or
thought of; the general result. The one kind of co-operation seems to have its
analogue in those related movements of our body which we are able consciously
to direct. The other kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue in the correlation
of the innumerable movement, of which we are unconscious, that maintain the bodily
frame &#8212; motions which in their complexity, delicacy and precision far transcend
our powers of conscious direction, yet by whose perfect adjustment to each other
and to the purpose of the whole, that co-operation of part and function, that
makes up the human body and keeps it in life and vigor, is brought about and
supported. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em>&nbsp;&#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe310.html">unabridged:

        <br>
To attempt to apply that kind of co-operation which requires direction from without
to the work proper for that kind of co-operation which requires direction from
within, is like asking the carpenter who can build a chicken-house to build a
chicken also. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe310.html">unabridged:

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-operation and Competition </span><br>
    <br>
MANY if not most of the writers on political economy have treated exchange as
a part of distribution. On the contrary, it belongs to production. It is by exchange,
and through exchange, that man obtains, and is able to exert, the power of co-operation
which, with the advance of civilization, so enormously increases his ability
to produce wealth. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

Chapter 9, The Office of Exchange in Production</a><br>
          <br>
THEY who, seeing how men are forced by competition to the extreme of human wretchedness,
jump to the conclusion that competition should be abolished, are like those who,
seeing a house burn down, would prohibit the use of fire. <br>
          <br>
The air we breathe exerts upon every square inch of our bodies a pressure of
fifteen pounds. Were this pressure exerted only on one side, it would pin us
to the ground and crush us to a jelly. But being exerted on all sides, we move
under it with perfect freedom. It not only does not inconvenience us, but it
serves such indispensable purposes that, relieved of its pressure, we should
die. <br>
          <br>
So it is with competition. Where there exists a class denied all right to the
element necessary to life arid labor, competition is one-sided, and as population
increases must press the lowest class into virtual slavery, and even starvation.
But where the natural rights of all are secured, then competition, acting on
every hand &#8212; between employers as between employed, between buyers as between
sellers &#8212; can injure no one. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
On the contrary it becomes the most simple, most extensive, most elastic, and
most refined system of co-operation that, in the present stage of social development,
and in the domain where it will freely act, we can rely on for the co-ordination
of industry and the economizing of social forces. <br>
          <br>
In short, competition plays just such a part in the social organism as those
vital impulses which are beneath consciousness do in the bodily organism. With
it, as with them, it is only necessary that it should be free. The line at which
the state should come in is that where free competition becomes impossible &#8212; a
line analogous to that which in the individual organism separates the conscious
from the unconscious functions. There is such a line, though extreme socialists
and extreme individualists both ignore it. The extreme individualist is like
the man who would have his hunger provide him food; the extreme socialist is
like the man who would have his conscious will direct his stomach how to digest
it. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, chapter 28 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT28.html#Chapter%2028">econlib</a></p>
  <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
    tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous application
    of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak of it as free
    trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than
    a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. <strong>Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not
merely abolish all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct
taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath.</strong> &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter
