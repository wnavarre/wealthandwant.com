  Transportation Cost </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">Stemming Sprawl: The Fiscal Approach</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
    transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
  concepts: access and mobility.</p>
  <p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
    on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
    calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
    equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The
    study concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
    are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public a
    total
    of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
    represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
    by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation
    requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities
    are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
    user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs to
    society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
    another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle
    use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid
    by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all but the marginal
    out-of-pocket operating costs.</p>
  <p>The relationship between transportation costs and land values can be made
    even clearer by empirical study of how land values increase as one moves toward
    the center of the city. In an investigation for the Urban Land Institute, the
    author concluded that, for Portland, Oregon, each additional mile [traveled]
    translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in locations
    command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile difference, all
  other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000 in new home value.</p>
  <p> For a household in which one worker drives downtown (or at least to a more
    central location) to work, that ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles
    annually, assuming 230 days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each
    day. Moreover, if non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled
    that amount, the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could
    mean a higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
    saved/spent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If
    the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
    annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much (and likely
    more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs along with other
    experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
    American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
    2001 cost 51 cents per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This
    figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not the additional costs passed
  on to society.</p>
  <p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs of
    highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines
    so that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive more safely
    are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible.
    Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive to participate in
    this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and ozone
    are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific fact. Despite frequent
    headlines about replacing the internal combustion engine, all the realistic
    substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel power, solar-powered cars are
    far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And
    every person driving his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents.
    When people step into a car, they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the
    direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial way, there will
    surely be significant changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation
    choices. As will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them
    to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays
    its own way. ...</p>
  <p>Sooner than Americans are likely to bear the real burden of global warming's
    environmental consequences, they are likely to experience the onset of price
    rises for petroleum. Experts are divided, but among those best insulated from
    the pressures of bias, there is increasing consensus that the peak of oil extraction
    worldwide will come sometime around 2010 if not sooner.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> Rising
    prices will not induce greater supply; it will not change the fact that the
    world will have passed the point of most easily extracted oil and will enter
    a long and increasingly steep period of declining availability. It is rather
    a matter of physics: When it costs more in energy to bring oil from deep in
    the earth than what can be extracted, it is not worth the investment. Even
    the greater wealth of American society will not insulate it from world competition
    over what is a limited and fungible commodity. How this alters the calculations
    Americans make about where to live and work will increasingly depend on the
  price they are willing to pay for transportation service. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
  <p> From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
    land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
    generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites that
    accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured by
    public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive use of
    natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical economics
    to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical economic
    frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
    intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations that
    are less dependent on transportation services. Land rent is highest where
    the greatest
    traffic and market exchanges occur, that being at the center of large conurbations.
    Comparing land values of urban property parcels, the highest land rent in
    the urban cores and traffic junctures are analogous to the contours of land
    elevations.
    Mountain peaks gradually slope down to valleys and flatland regions and continue
    outward until at distant points &#8212; perhaps at the poles of the earth &#8212; land
    sites have no market value at all.</p>
  <p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
    realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
    of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
    the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
    city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
    includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years
    ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
    declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
    1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
    New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold by
    Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
    take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
    occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build
    high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood
    of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs
    associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
    should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
    relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used for
    agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban
    areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity
    to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even
    unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly when land
    sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation service
    or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New
    York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased
    land values (constant dollars) within just two miles of its corridor in the
    forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
    is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment! The
    Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
    system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
    $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any
    major building construction project, private or public, will have a similar
    effect on adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound
    effect on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
    development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
    to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
  course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well. ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts
    of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985
study &#8220;Who Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The other component of a real property parcel is the land value, which reflects
    a market price based on very different criteria. Despite the apparent reality
    that land is visible and tangible, <strong>land prices reflect the value
    of location more than they do the material content they contain.</strong> This is easy to understand
    when one reflects that if some earth is removed from a site and brought to
    another place, the prices of each site is largely unaffected.21 Location
    value has duration, and the value of this flow of rights for exclusive use
    of a site requires a flow price rather than a stock price. This flow is really
    what classical economists refer to as ground rent or economic rent.22 Also
    known as &#8220;land rent,&#8221; it is defined as &#8220;a payment to a
    factor beyond what is needed to put that factor into use; [it is a price
    for use] beyond what is needed to maintain a market for land.&#8221;23 Land
    has a selling price because we have come to regard land sites as objects,
    as commodities to be traded,24 and they are understood to have a static price,
    as a stock rather than as a flow. That stock price really needs to be understood
    instead as the &#8220;present value&#8221; of the flow of ground rent minus
    taxes. &#8220;Present value&#8221; is an economic term that refers to &#8220;the
    worth of a future stream of returns or costs in terms of their value now.&#8221;25
  Consideration in this way brings to the fore other concerns and factors.</p>
  <p>The market price of a location depends not only on ground rent and taxes,
    effectively its present value, but also upon the &#8220;discount rate,&#8221; or
    interest rate, that prevails in the market used to calculate its returns
    and costs. When interest rates go up, the market prices of sites fall, just
    as for any other economic encumbrances placed on locational sites.</p>
  <p>The market prices of sites also fall if taxes go up and nothing else changes.
    However, an increase in taxes is often accompanied by improvements in any
    obligations linked to parcel locations. These too are sometimes easily &#8220;commodified,&#8221;26
    and may vary according to time period, changed neighborhood expectations,
    emergency conditions, government regulations, and so on.27 These contingent
    links often constitute services that raise the market prices of sites more
    than the taxes depress them. <strong>Still another way of understanding the value
    of locations is to see them as capitalized transportation costs.28 Savings
    in transportation are likely to be expressed in the market price of sites.
    One way or another people are willing to pay for access to exchange markets:
    either in the form of site proximity or in the form of travel expenses. It
    is the reason why urban cores have higher site rents than peripheral areas
    and hinterlands. Hence the differential value of locations, dependent, not
    on anything titleholders do, but rather on the quality of community amenities.
    These all have a price.</strong></p>
  <p>The prices for services that raise land rents, like the services themselves,
    should be regarded as flows rather than as stocks. But, ironically, our payments
    for such services are not understood as flows affecting site values at all,
    but are seen rather as related to stock prices. The values of our property
    parcels are viewed solely as stocks, and therefore our taxes are seen as
    stock taxes. ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
