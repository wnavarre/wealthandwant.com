<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
    Increasing Importance of Social Questions</a> (Chapter 1 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
    Problems</a></em></strong>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[03] Between the development of society and the development of species there
    is a close analogy. In the lowest forms of animal life there is little difference
    of parts; both wants and powers are few and simple; movement seems automatic;
    and instincts are scarcely distinguishable from those of the vegetable. So
    homogeneous are some of these living things, that if cut in pieces, each
    piece still lives. But as life rises into higher manifestations, simplicity
    gives way to complexity, the parts develop into organs having separate functions
    and reciprocal relations, new wants and powers arise, and a greater and greater
    degree of intelligence is needed to secure food and avoid danger. Did fish,
    bird or beast possess no higher intelligence than the polyp, nature could
    bring them forth only to die.</p>
  <p>[04] This law &#8212; that the increasing complexity and delicacy of organization
    which give higher capacity and increased power are accompanied by increased
    wants and dangers, and require, therefore, increased intelligence &#8212; runs
    through nature. In the ascending scale of life at last comes man, the most
    highly and delicately organized of animals. Yet not only do his higher powers
    require for their use a higher intelligence than exists in other animals,
    but without higher intelligence he could not live. His skin is too thin;
    his nails too brittle; he is too poorly adapted for running, climbing, swimming
    or burrowing. Were he not gifted with intelligence greater than that of any
    beast, he would perish from cold, starve from inability to get food, or be
    exterminated by animals better equipped for the struggle in which brute instinct
    suffices.</p>
  <p>[05] In man, however, the intelligence which increases all through nature's
    rising scale passes at one bound into an intelligence so superior, that the
    difference seems of kind rather than degree. In him, that narrow and seemingly
    unconscious intelligence that we call instinct becomes conscious reason,
    and the godlike power of adaptation and invention makes feeble man nature's
    king.</p>
  <p>[06] But with man the ascending line stops. Animal life assumes no higher
    form; nor can we affirm that, in all his generations, man, as an animal,
    has a whit improved. But progression in another line begins. Where the development
    of species ends, social development commences, and that advance of society
    that we call civilization so increases human powers, that between savage
    and civilized man there is a gulf so vast as to suggest the gulf between
    the highly organized animal and the oyster glued to the rocks. And with every
    advance upon this line new vistas open. When we try to think what knowledge
    and power progressive civilization may give to the men of the future, imagination
    fails.</p>
  <p>[07] In this progression which begins with man, as in that which leads up
    to him, the same law holds. Each advance makes a demand for higher and higher
    intelligence. With the beginnings of society arises the need for social intelligence &#8212; for
    that consensus of individual intelligence which forms a public opinion, a
    public conscience, a public will, and is manifested in law, institutions
    and administration. As society develops, a higher and higher degree of this
    social intelligence is required, for the relation of individuals to each
    other becomes more intimate and important, and the increasing complexity
    of the social organization brings liability to new dangers.</p>
  <p>[08] In the rude beginning, each family produces its own food, makes its
    own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves, furnishes its own
    transportation. Compare with this independence the intricate interdependence
    of the denizens of a modern city. They may supply themselves with greater
    certainty, and in much greater variety and abundance, than the savage; but
    it is by the cooperation of thousands. Even the water they drink, and the
    artificial light they use, are brought to them by elaborate machinery, requiring
    the constant labor and watchfulness of many men. They may travel at a speed
    incredible to the savage; but in doing so resign life and limb to the care
    of others. A broken rail, a drunken engineer, a careless switchman, may hurl
    them to eternity. And the power of applying labor to the satisfaction of
    desire passes, in the same way, beyond the direct control of the individual.
    The laborer becomes but part of a great machine, which may at any time be
    paralyzed by causes beyond his power, or even his foresight. Thus does the
    well-being of each become more and more dependent upon the well-being of
    all &#8212; the individual more and more subordinate to society.</p>
  <p>[09] And so come new dangers. The rude society resembles the creatures that
    though cut into pieces will live; the highly civilized society is like a
    highly organized animal: a stab in a vital part, the suppression of a single
    function, is death. A savage village may be burned and its people driven
    off &#8212; but, used to direct recourse to nature, they can maintain themselves.
    Highly civilized man, however, accustomed to capital, to machinery, to the
    minute division of labor, becomes helpless when suddenly deprived of these
    and thrown upon nature. Under the factory system, some sixty persons, with
    the aid of much costly machinery, cooperate to the making of a pair of shoes.
    But, of the sixty, not one could make a whole shoe. This is the tendency
    in all branches of production, even in agriculture. How many farmers of the
    new generation can use the flail? How many farmers' wives can now make a
    coat from the wool? Many of our farmers do not even make their own butter
    or raise their own vegetables! There is an enormous gain in productive power
    from this division of labor, which assigns to the individual the production
    of but a few of the things, or even but a small part of one of the things,
    he needs, and makes each dependent upon others with whom he never comes in
    contact; but the social organization becomes more sensitive. A primitive
    village community may pursue the even tenor of its life without feeling disasters
    which overtake other villages but a few miles off; but in the closely knit
    civilization to which we have attained, a war, a scarcity, a commercial crisis,
    in one hemisphere produces powerful effects in the other, while shocks and
    jars from which a primitive community easily recovers would to a highly civilized
    community mean wreck.</p>

  Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ
    from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but
    <strong>deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of
    the industrial and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is
    to the health
    of the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation
    is to be secured. </strong>We would simply take for the community what belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience.</p>
  <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
    specially to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on the evils
    of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony of natural
    relations, which must be artificially organized or improved. In its idea
    there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the
    industrial relations of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine
    whose complicated parts shall properly work together under the direction
    of human intelligence. This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism.
    Failing to see the order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize
    God.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, <strong>we</strong> who call ourselves single-tax men (a name which expresses
    merely our practical propositions) <strong>see in the social and industrial
    relations of men not a machine which requires construction, but an organism
    which needs
    only to be suffered to grow. We see in the natural social and industrial
    laws such harmony as we see in the adjustments of the human body, and that
    as far transcends the power of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct
    as it is beyond man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct the vital movements
    of his frame.</strong> We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation
    to the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves
    the moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander
    and go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our
    time is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason why our beliefs
    tend toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent with a firm and reverent
    faith in God, and with the recognition of his law as the supreme law which
    men must follow if they would secure prosperity and avoid destruction. This
    is the reason why to us political economy only serves to show the depth of
    wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
    of Him of whom it was said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter
    of Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
                              of equal natural opportunities for the exercise
    of their powers and the removal of all legal restriction on the legitimate
    exercise of those powers &#8212; we
                              see the conformation of human law to the moral
                              law, that we hold with confidence that this is
                              not merely
                              the sufficient
                              remedy
                              for all the
                              evils you so strikingly
                              portray, but that it is the only possible remedy.

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> IMAGINE an aggregation of men which it was attempted to secure by the
  external direction involved in socialistic theories that division of labor
  which grows, up naturally in society where men are left free. For the intelligent
  direction thus required an individual man or individual men must be selected,
  for even if there be angels and archangels in the world that is invisible to
  us, they are not at our command. Taking no note of the difficulties which universal
  experience shows always to attend the choice of the depositories of power,
  and ignoring the inevitable tendency to tyranny and oppression, of command
  over the actions of others, simply consider, even if the very wisest and best
  of men were selected for such purposes, the task that would be put upon them
  in the ordering of the when, where, how and by whom, that would be involved
  in the intelligent direction and supervision of the almost infinitely complex
  and constantly changing relations and adjustments involved in such division
  of labor as goes on in a civilized community. It is evidently as much beyond
  the ability of conscious direction as the correlation of the processes that
  maintain the human body in health and vigor is beyond it. &#8212; <em>The Science

THE ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced, possible
of realization, but such a state of society cannot be manufactured &#8212; it
must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine. It can only live by the individual
life of its parts. And in the free and natural development of all the parts will
be secured the harmony of the whole. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp061.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp061.html"> &#8212; Book
