        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>a. Explanation of Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
          <p> Differences in the desirableness of land divide Wealth into the
            two funds, Wages and Rent. Labor naturally applies its forces to
            that land from which, considering all the existing and known circumstances,
            most Wealth can be produced with least expenditure of labor force.
            Such land is the best. So long as the best land exceeds demand for
            it, laborers are upon an equality of opportunity, and the entire
            product goes to them as Wages in proportion to the labor force they
            respectively expend. But when the supply of the best land falls below
            demand for it, some laborers must resort to land where with an equal
            expenditure of labor force they produce less wealth than those who
            use the best land. The laborers thus excluded from the best land
            naturally offer a premium for it, or what is the same thing, offer
            to work for its owners for what they might obtain by working for
            themselves upon the poorer land. This condition differentiates Rent
            from Wages. Rent goes to land-owners as such, irrespective of whether
            they labor or not; Wages go to laborers as such, irrespective of
            whether they own land or not.85</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">85. Land of every kind may vary in desirableness
                from other land of the same kind. Certain farming land, for example,
                is so fertile that it will yield to a given application of labor
                two bushels of wheat to every bushel that certain other farming
                land will yield; and it is obvious that, other things being equal,
                farmers would prefer the more fertile land. But some fertile
                land lies so far away from market that less fertile land lying
                nearer is more productive, because it costs less to exchange
                its products for what their producer demands; in such cases farmers
                would prefer the less fertile land. The same principle applies
                to all kinds of land. Building lots at or near a center of residence
                or business are preferable for most purposes of residence or
                business to lots equally good in other respects which are far
                away.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Now, the land that is preferable is of course
                most in demand; and if it be all in use, with demand for it unsatisfied,
                competition for the preference sets in, and gives value to it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">All land cannot be equally desirable. Some excels
                in fertility. Some is rich with mineral deposits, a species of
                fertility. On some, towns and cities settle, thereby adding to
                the productiveness of the labor that uses it, because these sites
                are thus made centers of co-operation or trade. And yet production
                in the civilized state requires that the producer shall have
                exclusive possession of the land lie needs. This necessity inevitably
                gives to some people more desirable land than others have, even
                though all should have an abundance. Consequently the returns
                to equal labor are unequal. The man who has land that is more
                fertile or better located than that of another gets more wealth
                than the other in return for a given expenditure of labor. If,
                for example, one with given labor produces 10 bushels of corn
                from fertile land, equal, say, to $5 worth of any kind of wealth
                in the market, and the other with the same labor produces 8 bushels
                of corn, or $4 worth of any kind of wealth in the market, the
                first receives 2 bushels (or $1) more for his labor than the
                other receives for his, though each labors with equal effort,
                skill, and intelligence. Or, if the fertility of the land be
                the same, but its situation in reference to the market be such
                that the cost of transportation still preserves the relation
                of $5 to $4, the same inequality of wages results. It is this
                phenomenon that gives rise to Rent. Rent is the market value
                of just such differences in opportunity as are here illustrated.
                It is a premium for choice land, for preferential locations,
                for site, for space.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> This premium is a very different thing from compensation
                for labor. Nor is the difference modified when premium owners
                first obtain Wages for work and with them buy the premium-commanding
                land. Rent can no more be turned into compensation for labor
                by exchanging labor products for the power to exact it, than
                a man can be turned into Wealth by exchanging Wealth for him.
                Whether the fruits of purchase or of conquest, or of fraud, Rent
                always constitutes that part of Wealth which is deducted from
                current production as premiums for superior opportunities for
                production.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Wages and Rent are both drawn from Wealth, and
                both go often to the same individual and in the same form of
                payment, as when a freehold farmer enjoys the use of the grain
                he raises from more fertile land than his neighbors have, or
                a city freeholder occupies or receives hire from his house and
                lot: but Wages flow from Wealth to labor as compensation for
                production, while Rent flows from Wealth to land-owners in premiums
                for allowing labor to produce Wealth from superior locations.
                Wages are appurtenant to Labor; Rent is appurtenant to Land.
                It is as laborer that the individual takes Wages, but as land-owner
                that he takes Rent.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>To illustrate: On the following page are four closed spaces representing
            land which varies in productiveness to a given expenditure of labor
            force, 86 from 4 down to 1. There is also an open space at the right,
            representing land that is yet so poor as to yield nothing to the
            given expenditure of labor force. Thus: [chart]</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">86. A unit of labor cannot be definitely measured
                save by the value of some labor product. The day's labor of one
                man may produce less than an hour's labor of another. But for
                purposes of illustration it is competent to refer to a unit of
                labor force as an abstraction, intending thereby to denote all
                the labor of muscle and brain requisite to acquire the necessary
                knowledge and skill and to produce wealth to a given value from
                given natural sources.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>For simplicity let the market be equally convenient to each space.
            Let it be assumed also that one space is as accessible to labor as
            another, and that the differences in their productiveness are known.
            Now, to which space would labor first resort? Obviously to that which
            would yield most Wealth to the given expenditure of labor force &#8212; the
            space to the extreme left.</p>
          <p>Suppose, then, that labor appropriates only as much of the best
            space as is required for use &#8212; say half of it. We may note
            the fact with red color upon the chart: [chart]</p>
          <p align="left">Here we see that Wages are 4 and Rent 0. The laborers, as such,
            take the entire product, dividing it among themselves in proportion
            to their services. There is no Rent because other laborers find equally
            good opportunities to produce in the uncolored part of the space;
            the supply of the best land exceeds the demand for it, and of course
            it commands no premium.87</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">87. &quot;No land ever pays rent unless in point
                of fertility or situation it belongs to those superior kinds
                which exist in less quantity than the demand.&quot; &#8212; <em>Mill's
                Prin., book ii, ch. xvi, sec. 2.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The produce of labor constitutes the natural
                recompense or wages of labor. In that original state of things,
                which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation
                of stock, the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer.&quot; &#8212; <em>Smith's
                Wealth of Nations, book i, ch. viii.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Rent or land value does not arise from the
                productiveness or utility of land. It in no wise represents any
                help or advantage given to production, but simply the power of
                securing a part of the results of production. No matter what
                are its capabilities, land can yield no rent and have no value
                until some one is willing to give labor or the results of labor
                for the privilege of using it; and what any one will thus give,
                depends not upon the capacity of the land, but upon its capacity
                as compared with that of land that can be had for nothing. I
                may have very rich land, but it will yield no rent and have no
                value so long as there is other land as good to be had without
                cost. But when this other land is appropriated, and the best
                land to be had for nothing is inferior, either in fertility,
                situation, or other quality, my land will begin to have a value
                and yield rent. And though the productiveness of my land may
                decrease, yet if the productiveness of the land to be had without
                charge decreases in greater proportion, the rent I can get, and
                consequently the value of my land, will steadily increase. Rent,
                in short, is the price of monopoly, arising from the reduction
                to individual ownership of natural elements which human exertion
                can neither produce nor increase.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
                and Poverty, book iii, ch. ii.</em></font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>But if demand for land should continue until the best space was
            monopolized, 88 and some laborers were forced to resort to the next,
            the best space would command a premium; 89 Rent would rise and Wages
            would fall. Even though but few laborers were forced to the poorer
            space, they would be perpetual bidders for the advantages of the
            other space. The effect may be illustrated by indicating with red
            in our chart the overflow of labor from the first into the second
            space: [chart]</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">88. &quot;Rent is the effect of a monopoly; though
                the monopoly is a natural one, which may be regulated, which
                may even be held as a trust for the community generally, but
                which cannot be prevented from existing. . . If all the land
                of the country belonged to one person he could fix the rent at
                his pleasure. . . The effect would be much the same if the land
                belonged to so few people that they could and did act together
                as one man and the rent by agreement among themselves . . . The
                only remaining supposition is that of free competition. &#8212; <em>Mill's
                Prin., book ii, ch. xvi, sec. I.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">Rent &quot;considered as the price paid for the
                use of the land is naturally a monopoly price.&quot; &#8212; <em>Smith's
                Wealth of Nations, book o, ch. xi. </em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">89. The line of separation between the poorest
                land thus commanding a premium, and the best land for which labor
                will not pay a premium, was formerly called &quot;the margin
                of cultivation,&quot; probably because the law of rent was not
                understood with reference to any but agricultural land; but it
                is now more generally called &quot;the margin of production,&quot; since
                it is understood that the law of rent applies to all kinds of
                land, including, of course, the building lots of cities.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">The premium for land falls not into the fund termed
                Wages, but into the fund termed Rent. Henceforth Wages consist
                not of the entire product of labor, but of so much of that product
                as might with the same expenditure of labor force be produced
                from the best land that commands no premium. The remainder goes
                to the owners of the land from which it is in fact produced,
                in proportion to the advantages which their land respectively
                contributes to its production. This excess is the premium. It
                is what constitutes Rent as distinguished from Wages. And both
                the amount of the general fund Rent, and the amount of rent which
                each land-owner obtains, are determined by the competition of
                labor for superior opportunities.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Thus, in the beginnings all Wealth would be Wages;
                but as labor was forced from better to poorer lands, or, what
                is the same thing in its principle of operation, as greater capabilities
                attached to particular lands in consequence of social development,
                good government, industrial improvement, etc. Rent would arise,
                and as a proportion of the gross Wealth-product, would increase
                as labor was forced to poorer land or new capabilities were added
                to land by society. The law derived from these phenomena is known
                as Ricardo's law of rent. Henry George formulates it as follows:</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The rent of land is determined by the excess
                of its produce over that which the same application can secure
                from the least productive land in use.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
                and Poverty, book iii, ch. ii.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> As will be noticed, the law is the law of Wages
                as well as the law of Rent. For whatever determines the proportion
                of Wealth to be taken as Rent necessarily determines the proportion
                to be left as Wages.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This illustrates the elementary principle of Distribution, that
            Wages fall and Rent rises as demand for land forces labor to land
            of lower productiveness.90 The principle may be more graphically
            illustrated by supposing that demand for spaces in the chart advances
            so far as to include all the closed spaces, except part of the poorest
            one. Thus: [chart]</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">90. Though figures are used, these charts are
                to be understood not as mathematical <em>demonstrations,</em> but
                simply as <em>illustrations.</em> </font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We now find that all Wages have fallen to the level of Wages on
            the poorest land that yields anything to the given unit of labor
            force; while the Rent of all but that has, at the expense of Wages,
            risen in proportion to its superior productiveness.91</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">91. The labor that was forced to the poorest lands
                would continually bid for the opportunities that the better lands
                offered, until an equilibrium was reached at the point shown
                in the preceding chart, where the given expenditure of labor
                is as well compensated in one place as in another.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">If laborer and land-owner be different persons,
                the laborer receives what is distinguished as Wages, and the
                land-owner what is distinguished as Rent. If the same person,
                he receives Wages as laborer and Rent as land-owner.</font></p>

          <p> Reflection will convince us that this must be so. Wages for a given
            expenditure of labor force are no more anywhere, for any length of
            time, all things considered, than the same expenditure of labor force
            will produce from the best land to be had for nothing. Rent absorbs
            the difference.92</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">92. But we must not jump to the conclusion that
                there is any essential wrong in Rent. Rent is nature's method
                of measuring the value of the differences in natural opportunity
                which different laborers, owing to variations in land, are obliged
                to accept. And, what in practice is more important, it is nature's
                method of measuring the value to each individual of those advantages
                which consist in accumulations of common knowledge, in co-operative
                effort, in good government, in a word, in the benefits that society
                as a whole confers as distinguished from those which each individual
                earns. The question is not one of the rightfulness or the wrongfulness
                of Rent. Personal freedom necessitates Rent, for it necessitates
                the private possession of land, and private possession of land
                makes Rent inevitable. Nothing short of communism could abolish
                it. The real question is, What shall society do with Rent? Shall
                it give it to individuals, or use it for common purposes?</font></p>

                become by reason of this limitation, not an absolute right to
                use any part of the earth, but (1) an absolute right to use any
                part of the earth as to which his use does not conflict with
                the equal rights of others (i. e., which no one else wants to

          <p><strong><em>  b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
          <p> In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored,
            it being assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not
            become more productive.93 Let us now try to illustrate that effect,
            upon the supposition that social growth increases the productive
            power of the given expenditure of labor force as applied to the first
            closed space, to 100; as applied to the second, to 50; as applied
            to the third, to 10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as applied
            to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for
            land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population

                bringing out in land special capabilities otherwise latent, and <em>by
              attaching special capabilities to particular lands.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode,

                Poverty, book iv, ch. iii.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks
                off land from those material things which we regard as products
                of the land, we shall find that the fundamental attribute of
                land is its extension. The right to use a piece of land gives
                command over a certain space &#8212; a certain part of the earth's
                surface. The area of the earth is fixed; the geometric relations
                in which any particular part of it stands to other parts are
                fixed. Man has no control over them; they are wholly unaffected
                by demand; they have no cost of production; there is no supply
                price at which they can be produced.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's
                surface is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it

                heat and the light, the air and the rain which nature assigns
                to that area;<em> and it determines his distance from, and in
                great measure his relations to, other things and other persons</em>.
                We shall find that it is this property of land, which, though
                as yet insufficient prominence has been given to it, is the ultimate
                cause of the distinction which all writers are compelled to make
                between land and other things.&quot; &#8212; <em>Marshall's Prin.,

                this regular way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are
                intended to illustrate the universal fact that as any land becomes
                a center of trade or other social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social
            growth. But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive
            power of labor increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency
            of Wages (as a proportion of product if not as an absolute quantity)
            is downward, while that of Rent is upward. 95 And this conclusion
            is confirmed by observation. 96</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the
                reader, before closing this chapter, of what has been before
                stated &#8212; that I am using the word wages not in the sense
                of a quantity, but in the sense of a proportion. When I say that
                wages fall as rent rises, I do not mean that the quantity of
                wealth obtained by laborers as wages is necessarily less, but
                that the proportion which it bears to the whole produce is necessarily
                less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity remains
                the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,
                book iii, ch. vi.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> 96. The condition illustrated in the last chart
                would be the result of social growth if all land but that which
                was in full use were common land. The discovery of mines, the
                development of cities and towns, and the construction of railroads,
                the irrigation of and places, improvements in government, all
                the infinite conveniences and laborsaving devices that civilization
                generates, would tend to abolish poverty by increasing the compensation
                of labor, and making it impossible for any man to be in involuntary
                idleness, or underpaid, so long as mankind was in want. If demand
                for land increased, Wages would tend to fall as the demand brought
                lower grades of land into use; but they would at the same time
                tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower
                grades. And it is altogether probable that, while progress would
                lower Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase
                them as an absolute quantity.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
          <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
            progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that
            if Rent be treated as common property, advances in productive power
            shall be steps in the direction of realizing through orderly and
            natural growth those grand conceptions of both the socialist and
            the individualist, which in the present condition of society are
            justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning that
            if Rent be treated as <em>private</em> property, advances in productive
            power will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many
            laborers, and masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that
            common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural law, and that
            its private appropriation is disorderly and degrading? When the cause
            of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the preceding chart are considered
            in connection with the self-evident truth that God made the earth
            for common use and not for private monopoly, how can a contrary inference
            hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97 the benefits of which
            should be common, and attaching to land, the just right to which
            is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
                settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public
                revenues, and none of the land about him has any value. Another
                settler comes, and another, until a village appears. Some public
                revenue is then required. Not much, but some. And the land has
                a little value, only a little; perhaps just enough to equal the
                need for public revenue. The village becomes a town. More revenues
                are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes a city. The
                public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land values. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
                with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the
                decline of society, it measures the earning power of society
                as a whole as distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages,
                on the other hand, measure the earning power of the individuals
                as distinguished from that of society as a whole. We have distinguished
                the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent;
                but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
                all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
                Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any
                question as to the fund from which society should be supported?
                How can it be justly supported in any other way than out of its
                own earnings? </font></p>

          <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and
            who can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the
            earnings of the community, shall be retained for the support of the
            community, and that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall
            be left to the individual in proportion to the value of his service.
            This is the divine law, whether we trace it through complex moral
            and economic relations, or find it in the eighth commandment.</p>

          <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law,

                In the narrow scale of individual actions and individual life

          <p> Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning
            with the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take
            possession of the best land. But instead of leaving for others what
            they do not themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations,
            they appropriate the whole space, using only part, but claiming ownership
            of the rest. We may distinguish the used part with red color, and
            that which is appropriated without use with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
          <p align="left"><br />
  But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years
                ago a workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing
                possession of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by a
                college for his &quot;find.&quot; But the owner of the land on
                which the meteorite fell claimed the money, and the two went
                to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court of the
                State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
                nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because
                the title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land
                upon which it fell.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come,
            instead of finding half of the best land still common and free, as
            in the corresponding chart on page 68, they find all of it owned,
            and are obliged either to go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from
            owners of the best. How much will they pay for the best? Not more
            than 1, if they want it for use and not to hold for a higher price
            in the future, for that represents the full difference between its
            productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if the
            first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce
            and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at
            that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade,
            though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently land of
            the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
          <p align="left">As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is
            arbitrary it cannot be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price
            is limited by the superiority of the best land over that which can
            be had for nothing, and the chart may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
          <p align="left">And now, owing to the success of the appropriators
            of the best land in securing more than their fellows for the same
            expenditure
            of labor force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not
            to use it that it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put
            Rent into their own pockets as soon as growing demand for land makes
            it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose that all the remainder
            of the second space and the whole of the third are thus appropriated,
            and note the effect: [chart]</p>
          <p align="left">At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall,
            because there is no increased demand for land for use. The holding
            of inferior
            land for higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is
            like owning lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not
            profitable. But let more land be needed for use, and matters promptly
            assume a different appearance. The new labor must either go to the
            space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from owners of better grades,
            or hire out. The effect would be the same in any case. Nobody for
            the given expenditure of labor force would get more than 1; the surplus
            of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly in rent
            payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus:</p>

                or continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground

                is, capitalized for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy
                it, and it is to selling value that we usually refer when dealing

                value will be the capitalization of its present or prospective
                power of producing Rent. In fact, much the larger proportion
                of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly unused,

                other words, a certain 'number of years' purchase' of that rental;
                and other things being equal, it will be the higher the more
                important these direct gratifications are, as well as the greater
                the chance that they and the money income afforded by the land
                will rise.&quot; &#8212; <em>Id., note.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality
                inhering in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the
                possession of a thing the power of obtaining other things, in
                return for it or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the
                usual sense &#8212; is purely relative. It exists from and is
                measured by the power of obtaining things for things by exchanging
                them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for nothing can be valuable
                unless it has the quality of gratifying some physical or mental
                desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But utility
                of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
                of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having
                some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable,
                as they are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may
                see that with most of the things that have value this difficulty
                or ease of getting them, which determines value, depends on the
                amount of labor which must be expended in producing them ; i.e.,
                bringing them into the place, form and condition in which they
                are desired. . . Value is simply an expression of the labor required
                for the production of such a thing. But there are some things
                as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by labor,
                yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
                on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show
                that such facts are but exemplifications of the general principle,
                just as the rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify
                the universal law of gravitation. . . The value of everything
                produced by labor, from a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to
                the elaborate structure and appurtenances of a first-class ocean
                steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the
                labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
                the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
                of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent
                of the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the
                owner to obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <em><a href="../../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher,

          <p> The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
            Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space,
            but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent
            nor Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
          <p> In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
            with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
            of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space
            above the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under
            a system which confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land
            for speculative purposes becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum
            long before they would if land were appropriated only for use.</p>
          <p> In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use
            we have as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume
            as before (page 73), that social growth increases the productive
            power of the given expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied
            to the best land, 50 when applied to the next best, 10 to the next,
            3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would not be benefited
            now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation
            of land for use only, although much less land is actually used. The
            prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before men
            as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it
            more than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would
            be taken up in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would
            be crowded out to the open space that originally yielded nothing,
            but which in consequence of increased labor power now yields as much
            as the poorest closed space originally yielded, namely, 1 to the
            given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would then be reduced
            to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>                <font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country
                have so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young
                man, go West,&quot; is truthfully described in &quot;Progress
                and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch. iv, as follows :<br />
&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard in search of the margin
of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent, must, like the
man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances through half-titled
farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where
land can be had free of rent &#8212; <em>i.e.</em>, by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is
            the least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the
            downward movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They
            cannot fall below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter
            how much productive power may increase, so long as it pays to hold
            land for higher values. Some laborers would continually be pushed
            back to land which increased productive power would have brought
            up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for
            work would so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure
            of labor force, however much it produced, could nowhere secure more
            than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would persist until some labor
            was forced upon land which, despite increase in productive power,
            would not yield the accustomed living without increase of labor force.
            Competition for work would then compel all laborers to increase their
            expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over again as progress
            went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized, until
            human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
            be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political
                Economy,&quot; book ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements
                in agricultural implements which diminish the expense of cultivation,
                that they do not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages
                of his laborers, but that &quot;the landlord will receive in
                addition to the rent already paid to him, all that is saved in
                the expense of cultivation.&quot; This is true not alone of improvements
                in agriculture, but also of improvements in all other branches
                of industry.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> 104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation
                in commodities, the tendency of increasing price to draw forth
                additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance in
                land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency
                can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
                a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor
                and capital as the condition of engaging in production. If it
                were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were reached,
                it would be possible to continuously increase rent until it swallowed
                up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced
                below the point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce,
                nor interest below the point at which capital will be devoted
                to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
                advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope
                to advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already
                near the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably
                above it. Yet that there is in all progressive countries a constant
                tendency in the speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit
                where production would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring
                seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and

          <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general
            readjustment are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate
            in forcing unused land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and
            reviving industry. Thus increase of labor force, a lowering of the
            scale of living, and depression of Rent, co-operate to bring on what
            we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner do &quot;good times &quot; return
            than renewed demands for land set in, Rent rises again, Wages fall
            again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear. The end of every
            period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages lower
            than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

            <p> <font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent
                or land values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial
                depression is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other
                the relation of cause and effect, is obvious to whoever considers
                the necessary relation between land and labor.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress

                a point at which an upward land market sets in. From that point

                of living, which is the same thing) in all departments of labor
                and with all grades of laborers. This tendency continues until
                the fictitious values of land give way. So long as the tendency
                is felt only by that class which is hired for wages, it is poverty
                merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of labor

                times&quot; on again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may
                be overcome, without much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient
                increase in productive power to overtake the fictitious value

          <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates
            Rent from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
            is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the
            maladjustment continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as
            naturally it should, actually generates and intensifies it. Poverty
            persists with increase of productive power because land values, when
            Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even greater increase. There
            can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals suffering
            and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>
          <p><em><strong>e. Effect of Retaining Rent for Common Use</strong></em></p>
          <p> If society retained Rent for common purposes, all incentive to
            hold land for any other object than immediate use would disappear.
            The effect may be illustrated by a comparison of the last preceding
            chart with the following: [chart]</p>
          <p align="left">  There is but one difference between this chart and the chart immediately preceding.
    In that Rent is confiscated to private use, whereas in this Rent is retained
    for common use. All the labor force indicated with red in the first of the
    two charts would not more than utilize the space to the left and part of
    the adjoining one, which would elevate Wages to what, with the given labor
    force, could be produced from the poorer of the two spaces. After that, increase
    of Rent would not enrich land-owners at the expense of other classes; it
    would enrich the whole community.108</p>

                all that he earned and no more than he earned in Production;

            <p><font size="-1"> In social conditions, where industry is subdivided
                and trade is intricate, it is impossible to say arbitrarily what
                is the equivalent of given labor. Hence no statute fixing the
                compensation for labor can really be operative. All that we can
                say is that labor is worth what men freely contract to give and
                take for it. But it must be what they freely contract to take
                as well as what they freely contract to give; and men are not
                free to contract for the sale of their labor when labor generally
                is so divorced from land as to abnormally glut the labor market
                and make men's sale of their labor for almost anything the buyer
                offers, the alternative of starvation. Laborers may be as truly
                enslaved by divorcing labor from land as by driving them with
