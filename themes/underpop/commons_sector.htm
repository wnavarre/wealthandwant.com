3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Part 2 of the book focuses on capitalism as it could be, a version
                      I call Capitalism 3.0. The key difference between versions
                  2.0 and 3.0
                        is the
                          inclusion in the latter of a set of institutions I
                call the commons sector. Instead
                            of having only one engine &#8212; that is, the corporate-dominated private
                            sector &#8212; our improved economic system would
                            run on two: one geared to maximizing private profit,
                            the
                            other to
                            preserving
                            and
                            enhancing common
                            wealth. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Assets in the commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their return
    to capital. Just as we receive them as shared gifts, so we have a duty to
    pass them on in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can
    add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade
    them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.</p>
  <p>Besides the commons, I use a few similar-sounding terms that should be clarified
    here as well.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>  By <em><strong>common wealth </strong></em>I mean the monetary and nonmonetary value of all
      the assets in the commons. Like stockholders&#8217; equity in a corporation,
            it may increase or decrease from year to year depending on how well
      the commons is managed.</li>
    <li>  By <em><strong>common property</strong></em> I mean a class of human-made rights that lies
              somewhere between private property and state property. Like private
              property, common
            property arises when the state recognizes it. Unlike private property,
              it&#8217;s
            inclusive rather than exclusive &#8212; it strives to share ownership
            as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.</li>
    <li>  By the <em><strong>commons sector</strong></em> I mean an organized
      sector of our economy. It embraces some of the gifts we inherit together,
      but not all.
          In effect, it&#8217;s a
              subset of the given commons that we consciously organize according
          to commons principles. It&#8217;s small at the moment, but the point
          of this book is that we should enlarge it. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 5: Reinventing the Commons (pages 65-78)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Thus far I&#8217;ve argued that Capitalism 2.0 &#8212; or surplus capitalism &#8212; has
        three tragic flaws: it devours nature, widens inequality, and fails to make
        us happier in the end. It behaves this way because it&#8217;s programmed
        to do so. It must make thneeds, reward property owners disproportionately,
        and distract us from truer paths to happiness because its algorithms
        direct it to do so. Neither enlightened managers nor the occasional zealous
        regulator
        can make it behave much differently.</p>
  <p><strong>In this part of the book I advance a solution. The essence of it
      is to fix capitalism&#8217;s operating system by adding a commons sector to balance
    the corporate sector.</strong> The new sector would supply virtuous feedback loops
    and proxies for unrepresented stakeholders: future generations, pollutees,
    and nonhuman species. And would offset the corporate sector&#8217;s negative
    externalities with positive externalities of comparable magnitude. If the
    corporate sector devours nature, the commons sector would protect it. If
    the corporate sector widens inequality, the commons sector would reduce it.
    If the corporate sector turns us into self-obsessed consumers, the commons
    sector would reconnect us to nature, community, and culture. All this would
    happen automatically once the commons sector is set up. The result would
    be a balanced economy that gives us the best of both sectors and the worst
    of neither.</p>
  <p>To be sure, building an economic sector from scratch is a formidable task.
    Fortunately, the commons sector needn&#8217;t be built from scratch; it has
    an enormous potential asset base just waiting to be claimed. That asset base
    is the commons itself, the gifts of nature and society we inherit and create
    together. As we&#8217;ll see, these gifts are worth more than all private
    assets combined. It&#8217;s the job of the commons sector to organize and
    protect these gifts, and by so doing, to save capitalism from itself. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Organizing Principles of the Commons Sector</strong></p>
  <p>Property rights, especially the common kind, require competent institutions
    to manage them. What we need today, then, along with more common property,
    is a set of institutions, distinct from corporations and government, whose
    unique and explicit mission is to manage common property.</p>
  <p>I say set of institutions because there will and should be variety. The
    commons sector should not be a monoculture like the corporate sector. Each
    institution should be appropriate to its particular asset and locale.</p>
  <p>Some of the variety will depend on whether the underlying asset is limited
    or inexhaustible. Typically, gifts of nature have limited capacities; the
    air can safely absorb only so much carbon dioxide, the oceans only so many
    drift nets. Institutions that manage natural assets must therefore be capable
    of limiting use. By contrast, ideas and cultural creations have endless potential
    for elaboration and reuse. In these commons, managing institutions should
    maximize public access and minimize private tollbooths.</p>
  <p>Despite their variations, commons sector institutions would share a set
    of organizing principles. Here are the main ones.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="-1">LEAVE ENOUGH AND AS GOOD IN COMMON</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>As Locke argued, it&#8217;s okay to privatize parts of the commons as long
        as &#8220;enough and as good&#8221; is left for everyone forever. Enough
        in the case of an ecosystem means enough to keep it alive and healthy. That
        much, or more, should be part of the commons, even if parts of the ecosystem
        are private. In the case of culture and science, enough means enough to assure
        a vibrant public domain. Exclusive licenses, such as patents and copyrights,
        should be kept to a minimum.</p>
      </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="-1">PUT FUTURE GENERATIONS FIRST</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>Corporations put the interests of stockholders first, while government puts
          the interests of campaign donors and living voters first. No one at the moment
          puts future generations first. That&#8217;s Job Number One for the commons
        sector.</p>
        <p>In practice, this means trustees of common property should be legally accountable
          to future generations. (We&#8217;ll see how this might work in chapter 6.)
          They should also be bound by the precautionary principle: when in doubt,
          err on the side of safety. And when faced with a conflict between short-term
        gain and long-term preservation, they should be required to choose the latter.</p>
      </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="-1">THE MORE THE MERRIER</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>Whereas private property is inherently exclusive, common property strives
            to be inclusive. It always wants more co-owners or participants, consistent
        with preservation of the asset.</p>
        <p>This organizing principle applies most clearly to commons like culture and
            the Internet, where physical limits are absent and increasing use unleashes
            synergies galore. It also applies to social compacts like Social Security
            and Medicare, which require universal participation. In these compacts, financial
            mechanisms express our solidarity with other members of our national community.
            They&#8217;re efficient and fair because they include everybody. Were they
            to operate under profit-maximizing principles, they&#8217;d inevitably exclude
            the poor (who couldn&#8217;t afford to participate) and anyone deemed by
        private insurers to be too risky.</p>
      </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
              one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded on
              the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural assets,
              it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and income rights.
              It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons equally, but
              everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from selling limited
        usage rights.</p>
      </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
      Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
                    of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent
        Fund shows, it&#8217;s
            possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on liquidity,
                but also on attention. People would notice common property if they got income
                from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it, and talk about it. Concern
        for invisible commons would soar.</p>
        <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since
          common property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable
          the way corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t
          reap capital gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income
          stakes throughout their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent,
          royalties, interest,
        and dividends. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
