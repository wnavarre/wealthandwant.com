  <p>Sometimes we have tendency to associate lower wages with services and higher
      wages with goods, or to think that manufacturing is superior to providing
    services to others. But the process of distributing goods is part of manufacturing,
    and it is the minute division of labor that permits us to specialize, to
    acquire the tools which make us efficient.</p>

<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following chart classifies about every kind of wealth that man requires,
    and also &quot;personal services,&quot; which, though as useful as wealth,
    do not crystallize in material products &#8212; such services as those of
    lawyers, barbers, doctors, teachers, actors, and so on: [chart]</p>
  <p> The circle of variegated colors represents the commercial
                                      reservoir into which Wealth is poured by
        production, and from which it is drawn for consumption,
                                                      each color typifying the
        kind of wealth or service
                                          named in it. Now, let us suppose that
        Personal Servants tap the commercial
                                            reservoir
                                                for
                                                  food.70
                                                      They do it by applying
    at retail stores for what will relieve their
                                                  poverty as to food, and food
        flows out to them&quot; as
                                                  indicated by the blue arrow,
        which we now insert in the chart: [chart]</p>
  <p>Let us now complete this chart. When we began it a distinction was noted
    between Personal Servants, who render mere intangible services, and the other
    classes, who produce tangible wealth. But essentially there is no difference.
    By referring to the chart and observing the course of the arrows, Food-makers
    are seen working for Personal Servants precisely as Personal Servants work
    for Luxury-makers. We may therefore abandon the distinction. This makes it
    no longer necessary to mention particular classes of products in the chart;
    it is enough to distinguish the different kinds of labor.76 Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">76. &quot;This, then, we may say is the great law which binds society &#8212; 'service
        for service.' &quot;&#8212; Dick's Outlines, p. 9.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For simplicity the workers have been divided into great classes, and each
    class has been supposed to serve only one other class. But the actual currents
    of trade are much more complex. It would be practically impossible to follow
    them in detail, or to illustrate their particular movements in any simple
    way. And it is unnecessary. The principle illustrated in the chart is the
    principle of all division of labor and trade, however minute the details
    and intricate the movement; and any person of ordinary intelligence who wishes
    to understand will need only to grasp the principle as illustrated by the
    chart to be able to apply it to the experiences of everyday industrial life.
    All legitimate trade is the interchange of Labor for Labor.77</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">77. In the light of this principle how absurd are some of the explanations
        of hard times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Overproduction! when an infinite variety of wants are
        unsatisfied which those who are in want are anxious and able to satisfy
        for one another.
      Hatters want bread, and bakers want hats, and farmers want both, and they
      all want
        machines, and machinists want bread and hats and machines, and so on
      without end. Yet while men are against their will in partial or complete
      idleness,
        their wants go unsatisfied! Since producers are also consumers, and production
        is governed by demand for consumption, there can be no real overproduction
        until demand ceases. The apparent overproduction which we see &#8212; overproduction
        relatively to &quot;effective demand&quot; &#8212; is in fact a congestion
        of some things due to an abnormal underproduction of other things, the
        underproduction being caused by obstructions in the way of labor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Scarcity of capital! when makers of capital in all its forms are involuntarily
        idle. Scarcity of capital, like scarcity of money, is only an expression
        for lack of employment. But why should there be any lack of employment while
        men have unsatisfied wants which they can reciprocally satisfy?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Too much competition! when competition and freedom are the same. It is not
        freedom but restraint, not competition but protection, that obstructs the
        action and reaction of demand and supply which we have illustrated in the
        chart.</font><br>
