<p>Jeff Smith: <a href="../../docs/Smith_SEP.html">How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</a> </p>
<p>Since forever, humans have claimed and counter-claimed every square inch of
  this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended peacefully. What has worked
  in other times and places might work again in the Mideast. Delivering a double
  dividend, what settled land disputes also developed moribund economies and
  revived developed ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has
  used this policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bloodless Resolutions</span> </p>
<p>On a distant ridge at dawn, a Palestinian might gaze across the desert at
  the hills where his fathers before him had grazed sheep, where now sprout Israeli
  settlements. Many American suburbanites, too, cannot go home anymore, to childhood&#8217;s
  field or woods or marsh, now filled or clear-cut or leveled and covered by
  monotonous boxy structures. An Australian aborigine knows a similar scene of
  displacement and an effective means of redress. ...</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mideast implementation</span> </p>
<p>These cases involved different classes, not different cultures. Yet with a
  new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may work between societies.
  The Koran urges landlords to not gouge tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not own land forever,
  since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National Trust leases all the land
  to the occupants. These strictures could lead to geonomics.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel and Palestine would establish a steward
    to collect land dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
    land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in more
    than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since Israelis prosper,
    they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners developing land, raising
    its value, fattening everyone's Citizens Dividend Arabs might accept that.
    Profit does make for strange bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan,
    recently agreed to explore for oil together. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mideast Development</span> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While sharing rent may soothe hurt
    feelings, collecting it stimulates development.</span> As a World Bank report
    acknowledged, all the Asian Tigers first had land reform before becoming
    Tigers. Land taxes impel owners to put their land to its best use, which
    requires employment and construction. As workers exchange wages for goods,
    they generate more output for everyone. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using geonomics, people have turned
    some of the poorest lands into the richest economies. Hong Kong is a barren
    rock owned by the public. The city collects enough site-rent to keep taxes
    on effort way down. </span>Thus prices are low and investment and income
    high, moving FORTUNE magazine to name Hong Kong the world's best city for
    business. In a different culture, Mexicali (Mexico) replaced the property
    tax with a land tax and bettered itself. </p>
<p>If Palestine does forgo taxes, it'd become a tax haven, attracting money from
  wealthier neighbors without incurring debt. As Palestine sustains development,
  it could sell bonds at a lower rate. When Palestinian bonds are selling on
  Wall Street, overlapping self-interest will wither the appeal of terrorist
  rhetoric. </p>
