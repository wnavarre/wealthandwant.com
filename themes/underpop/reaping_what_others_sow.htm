<p align="center"><strong>Reaping What Others Sow</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;others&quot; might be individuals, but more frequently, &quot;others&quot; is the community
  as a whole. Why should some of us be permitted to privatize that which we all
  create together? Is that the definition of a meritocracy: smart guys win, even
  if it is by stealing &#8212; legally! &#8212; from the community? </p>
<p>Why should some  grandchildren reap the increases in land value on property
  their grandparents bought? Their grandparents didn't create that land value:
  the community around them did. The community is entitled to that economic value.
  The estate tax takes a small fraction of it. Capital gains taxes take a small
  portion of it. Property taxes take a tiny fraction of it. But the bulk of
  it is left in the pockets of the lucky grandchildren, just as if their grandparents
  had actually contributed more than others did to that land value. <em>A very impolite
  fiction!</em></p>
<p>Arthur J. Ogilvy: <a href="../../docs/Ogilvy_Colonist's_Plea.html">A Colonist's Plea for Land Nationalization</a> (about 1890)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> If I sell goods or perform work for another, then no matter how high I
    may charge for the goods or the work, I am rendering goods for goods,
    service for service, earnings for earnings. What I offer is my labour,
    or the fruits of it, and as the public are free to get the same goods
    or services elsewhere if my terms don't suit, or to go without them,
    the fact of their accepting my terms shows that the thing I offer is,
    under the circumstances, worth the money. <br />
        <br />
    But in the case of this unearned increment on land there is no pretence
    of any exchange. I offer for it neither labour nor the produce of
    labour. All I do is to place my hand on a certain portion of the
    earth's surface, and say, &quot;No one shall use this without paying me for
    the mere permission to use it.&quot; I am rendering no more service in
    return for this extra pound, either to the purchaser or to society,
    than if I had acquired exclusive title to the air, and charged people
    for permission to breathe. And if, instead of selling my land for an
    additional pound, I let it at a proportionately additional rent the
    principle would be the same. <br />
        <br />
    The increase of value in my land has arisen from the execution of
    public works and increase of population, causing an increased demand
    for the land; in other words, it has arisen from the national progress;
    and I, so far from aiding in this progress have actually hindered it,
    by keeping my property locked up and so forcing on intending producers
    to inferior or less accessible lands; and by holding so much land back
    have helped to make land so much scarcer, and, therefore, so much
    dearer, and so have helped to increase the tribute which industry has
    to pay to monopoly for the mere privilege of exerting itself. <span class="style1">...</span><br>
    <br>
If Government, with the full consent of the governed, issued licenses  authorising to rob on the highway, the robbers, I suppose, would be  justified in acting on their privilege; but their gains, all the same,  would be appropriation and not earnings, no matter how high they paid  for their license or how honestly they came by the money to pay for it.  And if the public, disgusted with the system, demanded its immediate  abolition, the robbers would have a claim to compensation but their  compensation would have to be assessed, not by the amount of plunder  they had expected to make, but by the fee they had paid for their  license and the actual loss to which, in one way or another, they had  been put by the sudden abolition of a privilege they had honestly paid  for.  
<span class="style2">...</span><br>
<br>
Whether the value of land and the value of the improvements can be  separated or not, they are quite distinct elements, just as in a glass  of grog, the brandy is brandy and the water water, each with its own  distinctive properties and effects, notwithstanding their  indistinguishable com-mixture; and he therefore who lets land levies  blackmail upon industry by charging for something which represents no  service at all, none the less that at the same time he charges for  something else that does represent service. <br>
<br>
No doubt there are many other things besides land in which a monopoly  of the article will enable the possessor to levy something resembling  blackmail; but there are points of difference that distinguish them all  from the pure and simple appropriation of land monopoly.<span class="style2"><strong>...</strong></span><br>
</p>
  <p>Rent devours wages. <br>
      <br>
    Suppose the labourer to ask for a rise and the farmer to refuse, on the  ground that he cannot afford it. <br>
  <br>
    But presently something happens. A railway is made or a mine opened in  the neighbourhood, or some improved process enables a greater yield to  be obtained at the same cost, and there is now an appreciable surplus.  The labourer comes forward again and says, "You can afford it now." <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, no," replies his employer. "I might have done so, but  my lease is nearly up, and these advantages you refer to having made  the land more valuable, my landlord has notified that he means to raise  the rent; and as there certainly is a greater surplus available for  rent than there was, I must give it, for if I don't someone else will;  and so, as far as I am concerned, the surplus you calculate upon has  vanished." <br>
  <br>
    In short, whenever there is an increase in the productiveness of  industry creating an additional surplus, and the labourer stretches  forth his hand for a share of it, the landlord pushes him aside, and  takes it all himself; but as he keeps well out of sight in doing so,  using the employer as his instrument, his action is not perceived. And  as it is in the present so it has been in the past. Inventions and  discoveries have within the last century doubled the productiveness of  industry over and over again, but the labourer has no more benefited by  them than the employer has. The increase has been enormous, but, in the  primary industries at any rate, the landlord has taken it all. <br>
  <br>
    But some will say, "The labourer's exertion is a fixed quantity. The  increased productiveness of his industry is in no degree due to  himself, but to the improved appliances he works with, and, that being  so, the person who supplies these appliances that is, the employer has  a right to the increase. <br>
  <br>
    There is enough prima facie appearance of reason in this to have made  it worth discussing if the employer really got it, but he does not. He  gets interest, no doubt, on the additional expense he has incurred in  procuring the appliance, but he gets none of the increase of wealth due  to the increased efficiency of labour when aided by the appliance,  (once the appliance has come into general use); that, as we have seen,  goes to increase the value of land and raise rents, and while the  employer does not gain, the labourer in most cases actually loses; for  the usual result of labour-saving inventions, in the primary industries  at any rate, is not that the employer retains the same hands to do more  work, but that he discharges some of his men and does the old amount of  work with fewer hands. <br>
  <br>
    It is the landlord, who has neither invented, nor supplied, nor put to  use the appliances, who gets the whole benefit of them. ... <a href="../../docs/Ogilvy_Colonist's_Plea.html">read the whole paper</a>.</p>
