    Land Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury
in the Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>...I have before me a little book entitled &quot;Enclaves of Economic Rent,&quot; by
    C. W. Huntington....This book is published by Mr. Fiske Warren, a millionaire
    paper manufacturer who lives at Harvard, Massachusetts, and believes in the
    Single Tax by way of enclaves....I sought to persuade Mr. Warren that a great
    crisis was impending; that the inequality of wealth in our society a thing
    continually growing worse, was bound to bring a smash-up long before mankind
    had been persuaded to live in enclaves. To this Mr. Warren answered, in substance: &quot;You
    may be right; but if this civilization collapses, something else will have
    to be put in its place, and it may be useful to men to have a model of a
    better community.&quot;</p>
  <p>...How are these enclaves run? The principle is very simple. The community
    owns the land, and fixes the site value year by year, and those who occupy
    the land pay the full rental value of the land they occupy. Improvements of
    any kind are not taxed; you pay only for the use of what nature and the community
    have created. The community takes all this wealth and uses it, first to pay
    all the taxes on the land [and buildings -ds] the remaining money being expended
    for community purposes, by the democratic vote of all.</p>
  <p>What this means in practice you can see from the town of Fairhope, Alabama.
    Fairhope began nearly thirty years ago, with three hundred and fifty acres,
    and now has nearly four thousand acres. Its land is estimated to be worth a
    million dollars. But instead of this wealth being distributed among private
    owners, in accordance with the guessing power or each individual, the whole
    rental value is the property of the community, and the whole community prospers
    by the labors of each one.</p>
  <p>What this means in the way of moral values you may judge from one sentence
    in the little book: and I will follow the example of the book and quote this
    sentence in the same cold and unemotional fashion: &quot;No resident of Fairhope
    has been defendant in a criminal case in county court.&quot; Perhaps I should
    add that there is no place except the county court where anyone could be
    a defendant; there has never been a court or jail or anything of that sort
    in
    Fairhope.</p>
  <p>Or take the colony of Arden, Delaware, which is just south of Philadelphia.
      I could not say that no resident of Arden has ever been a defendant in
    a court &#8212; I
      myself having been one of eleven men who were arrested by a constable from
      the city of Wilmington, and sent to prison for the crime of playing baseball
      and tennis on Sunday! It is that kind of humorous story which you read
    about Arden, and not the serious efforts which are there being made to solve
    a great
      and pressing social problem.</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
    living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
    these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
    and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
    children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
    breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
    this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
    people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
    land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>

      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Followers of Henry George established several model communities. In one of
    them, Arden, Delaware, all residential land is owned by a trust. It leases
    the land to the residents, who pay rent only on their leaseholds. The trust
    itself pays property taxes to the county. Arden has prospered as a community
  with fine houses and lively community activities.37</p>
  <p>Many private communities implement the single tax on land in effect, collected
    as a fee or assessment. A condominium owner, for example, owns his unit and
    a share of the &#8220;common elements&#8221; such as building exteriors, landscaping,
    and recreation facilities. The unit owner pays an assessment often calculated
    as a &#8220;percentage interest,&#8221; based on the market value of the
    unit relative to other units. In effect, the unit owner is paying rent for
    use of
  the common elements.38 ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>There are, in fact, proprietary
  communities operating on the
  single tax model. Arden, Delaware, with a population of 4900, has had
  no local taxes since 1900. The Arden Corporation collects a fair
  market rent on each land parcel, which is reappraised annually. (They
  actually collect only about a fourth of the rent to which they are
  entitled.) From that they not only pay for all the municipal
  services, but rebate all property taxes levied by the county and
  school district.... <a href="../../docs/Sullivan_RL.html"><span
