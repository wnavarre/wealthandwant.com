<p align="center"><strong>Tax Deferral</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the concerns often expressed about rising property taxes is that
    people will be &quot;taxed out of their homes.&quot; Sometimes this is expressed as
    &quot;a man's home
                        is his castle, but it isn't really his if taxes might
    rise beyond his ability to pay.&quot;</p>
  <p>Interestingly, far fewer tears are shed for renters who cannot afford to
    pay rising apartment rents, or for people whose adjustable-rate mortgage
    payments rise precipitously. </p>
  <p>In California and Florida, and other places, this concern about not &quot;taxing
    people out of their homes&quot; led to Proposition 13 and &quot;Save Our Homes&quot; which
    have protected one class of people at the expense of burdening others. The
    result has been that new owners of homes may pay multiples of what their
    long-owning neighbors pay on identical properties.</p>
  <p>A better way is to permit those who feel they cannot afford rising property
    taxes to defer some or all of their property tax payment, with interest,
    as a lien against their property. That lien would be satisfied upon the sale
    or transfer of the property. In order to avoid burdening younger taxpayers
    with subsidizing such deferrals, revenue anticipation bonds could be issued,
    with the cost covered by the interest on the deferrals. </p>

        Tax Reform</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Costs of collection and administration</strong></p>
  <p>Consider the effect of abolishing income taxes and sales taxes, replacing
      them with a land value tax. There would no longer be any tax audits. There
      would be no record-keeping for taxes. You, the landowner, would instead get
      a monthly bill, like you get for utilities. You would simply pay the bill or
      have it automatically deducted from some financial account. At the same time,
      government would avoid the high cost of processing complex accounts and keeping
      individual tax records. It would only need to keep real estate records and
      assess the land values, both of which it already does for property tax purposes.</p>
  <p>Those who are retired or temporarily have little cash income would be able
      to defer taxes by accumulating liens on the real estate until they die or sell
      the property, as is commonly done today with real estate taxes.</p>
  <p>If you thought the assessment of the land value was too high, you could
    appeal, as one can today&#8217;s real estate taxes. The land value assessments would
      be public records available on the Internet, unlike income tax records, which
      are quite properly hidden from public view. You could easily compare your assessment
      with those of your neighbors. If the appeals board rejected your claim, the
      assessment could be appealed to a jury, if you were willing to pay the cost
      of the jury&#8217;s decision.</p>
  <p>Nobody would be sent to prison for tax evasion, because there would be no
      tax evasion. A non-payer would lose title to his land or lose the protective
      services of government, depending on the local enforcement practice. Property
      taxes are already being assessed and collected by counties in the U.S. A complete
      shift to the taxation of land values would not increase these costs, but would
      eliminate the expenses involved in collecting sales and income taxes. ... <a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

    Domain and Government Giveaways</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But our system wasn't designed to send signals all that well &#8212; Connecticut
      law required properties to be reassessed once every decade (and I've heard
      that once in early '70s and once in the late 80's was construed to satisfy
      that requirement). Now assessments are required every 4 years (though my
    town decided it didn't like the 2003 revaluation and is keeping the 1999
    for a few
      more years).<br>
      <br>
    But if the properties had been reassessed on a regular basis, with market-based
    values assigned first to the land and the residual being assigned to the existing
    buildings, the homeowners themselves would have been in a position to make their
    own rational decisions on whether it was worth it to them to continue to occupy
    extremely valuable land (and pay the taxes on it), or more to their advantage
    to accept an offer from someone who was prepared to put it to a higher and better
    use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere.<br>
    <br>
    I am sympathetic to those who want to occupy their homes forever, but if those
    homes are located on land that is valuable (because of its views or water access
    or transportation services, for example) or becomes valuable because of surrounding
    development, it seems fair that they compensate the rest of us for holding up
    progress, for continuing to occupy as single-family residences, land which it
    is now time to develop into something that produces good results for the entire
    community.<br>
    <br>
    Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or something else that
    was a highly appropriate use for its site &#8212; and typical of the
    neighborhood &#8212; 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
    a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial buildings. The
    home or diner is something everyone else has to walk around, drive around. If
    that site were well developed, it could prevent the premature development of
    far less desirable sites on the
    fringe of town &#8212; an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
    acres on the fringe.<br>
    <br>
    Should we protect the right of elderly people to stay in their homes, at the
    expense of the rest of the community? Should we protect the right of a young
    person who shares that home to stay there for an entire lifetime, at the expense
    of the community? I'm comfortable with the idea of allowing the elderly person
    to defer payment of the property taxes, with interest-bearing debt accruing against
    the property until it is sold or transferred. It seems to me to be an acceptable
    tradeoff, even if it creates potholes in the redevelopment. But his heirs should
    not inherit it until the lien is satisfied, which will usually mean that at last
    it will be developed consistent with the
    neighborhood.<br>
    <br>
    But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed, land first and
    buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which tell us when it might
    be time to move on.<br>
