  <p><strong><font size="-1">II. THE SINGLE TAX AS A FISCAL REFORM</font></strong></p>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>1. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXATION</strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxes are either direct or indirect; or, as they have been aptly described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
    taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself to others;
    direct taxes are those that cannot be shifted.5</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">5. &quot;Taxes are either direct or indirect. A direct
        tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who, it is intended
        or desired, should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded
        from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify
        himself at the expense of another.&quot; &#8212; John Stuart Mill's Prin.
        of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. I.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Direct taxes are those which are levied on the very
        persons who it is intended or desired should pay them, and which they
        cannot put off upon others by raising the prices of the taxed article..
        . . Indirect taxes on the other hand are those which are levied on persons
        who expect to get back the amount of the tax by raising the price of
        the taxed article.&quot; &#8212; Laughlin's Elements, par. 249.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes are direct &quot;when the payment is made by the
        person who is intended to bear the sacrifice.&quot; Indirect taxes are
        recovered from final purchasers. &#8212; Jevons's Primer, sec. 96.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Indirect taxes are so called because they are not
        paid into the treasury by the person who really bears the burden. The
        payer adds the amount of the tax to the price of the commodity taxed,
        and thus the taxation is concealed under the increased price of some
        article of luxury or convenience.&quot; &#8212; Thompson's Pol. Ec.,
        sec. 175.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their tendency
    to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall. Their magnitude
    and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for this reason that a great
    French economist of the last century denounced them as &quot;a scheme for
    so plucking geese as to get the most feathers with the least squawking.&quot;7</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6. Jevons defines the incidence of a tax as &quot;the
        manner in which it falls upon different classes of the population.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 96.<br />
      Sometimes called &quot;repercussion,&quot; and refers &quot;to the real
      as opposed to the nominal payment of taxes.&quot; &#8212; Ely's Taxation,
      p. 64.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">7. Though his language was blunt, the sentiment does not
        essentially differ from that of &quot;statesmen&quot; of our day who
        meet all the moral and economic objections to indirect taxation with
        the one reply that the people would not consent to pay enough or the
        support of government if public revenues were collected from them directly.
        This means nothing but that the people are actually hoodwinked by indirect
        taxation into sustaining a government that they would not support if
        they knew it was maintained at their expense; and instead of being a
        reason for continuing indirect taxation, would, if true, be one of the
        strongest of reasons for abolishing it. It is consistent neither with
        the plainest principles of democracy nor the simplest conceptions of
        morality.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
    of vastly more concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe
        manufacturers, enters into manufacturers' prices, and, together with
        the usual rate of profit upon that amount of investment, is recovered
        from wholesalers. The tax and the manufacturers' profit upon it then
        constitute part of the wholesale price and are collected from retailers.
        The retailers in turn collect the tax with all intermediate profits upon
        it, together with their :usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final
        purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface
        to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an
        indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of profits
        upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather
        output were imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather
        the amount of the tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment,
        and collect the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation,
        of tanning and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect
        with their profit from retailers, who would collect with their profit
        from shoe consumers. The principle applies also when taxes are levied
        upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or the money or credits of
        bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual profit to the prices of
        their goods, and bankers add it to their interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000; at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would
        cost retailers $121,000, and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would
        finally impose a tax burden of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more
        than the government would get. Upon most commodities the number of profits
        exceeds three, so that indirect taxes may frequently cost as much as
        100 per cent, even when imposed only upon what are commercially known
        as finished goods; when imposed upon materials also, the cost of collection
        might well run far above 200 percent in addition to the first cost of
        maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of
        indirect taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary.
        When shoe manufacturers, or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices,
        or bankers add them to interest, it is not because they might do otherwise
        but choose to do this; it is because the exigencies of trade compel them.
        Manufacturers, merchants, and other tradesmen who carry on competitive
        businesses must on the average sell their goods at cost plus the ordinary
        rate of profit, or go out of business. It follows that any increase in
        cost of production tends to increase the price of products. Now, a tax
        upon the output of business men, which they must pay as a condition of
        doing their business, is as truly part of the cost of their output as
        is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of the men they hire.
        Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase the price of
        their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as the tax is
        more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
        such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
        copyright publications is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly
        manufacturer whose prices are not checked by cost of production, and
        are therefore as a rule higher than competitive prices would be, may
        find it more profitable to bear the burden of a tax that leaves him some
        profit, by preserving his entire custom, than to drive off part of his
        custom by adding the tax to his usual prices. This is true also of a
        moderate import tax to the extent it falls upon goods that are more cheaply
        transported from the place of production to a foreign market where the
        import tax is imposed than to a home market where the goods would be
        free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance, of a farm in Canada
        near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian town. If the
        tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation the producer
        will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate effect
        would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
        may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
        will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
        cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">9. &quot;To collect taxes, to prevent and punish evasions,
        to check and countercheck revenue drawn from so many distinct sources,
        now make up probably three-fourths, perhaps seven-eighths, of the business
        of government outside of the preservation of order, the maintenance of
        the military arm, and the administration of justice.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch: v</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">10. For a brief and thorough exposition of indirect taxation
        read George's &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; ch. viii, on &quot; Tariffs
        for Revenue.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">11. This is usually a stumbling block to those who, without
        much experience in economic thought, consider the single tax for the
        first time. As soon as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities
        shift to consumers they jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes upon
        land values would shift to the users. But this is a mistake, and the
        explanation is simple. Taxes upon what men produce make production more
        difficult and so tend toward scarcity in the supply, which stimulates
        prices; but taxes upon land, provided the taxes be levied in proportion
        to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning market supply of course),
        because they make it more difficult to hold valuable land idle, and so
        depress prices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord. There
        are no means by which he can shift the burden upon anyone else. . . A
        tax on rent, therefore, has no effect other than its obvious one. It
        merely takes so much from the landlord and transfers it to the state.&quot; &#8212; John
        Stuart Mill's Prin. of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. 1.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax laid upon rent is borne solely by the owner
        of land.&quot; &#8212; Bascom's Tr., p.159.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Taxes which are levied on land . . . really fall
        on the owner of the land.&quot; &#8212; Mrs. Fawcett's Pol. Ec. for Beginners,
        pp.209, 210.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land tax levied in proportion to the rent of land,
        and varying with every variation of rents, . . . will fall wholly on
        the landlords.&quot; &#8212; Walker's Pol. Ec., ed. of 1887, p. 413,
        quoting Ricardo.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person
        who actually pays it to some other person varies with the object taxed.
        A tax on rents cannot be transferred. A tax on commodities is always
        transferred to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; Thorold Rogers's Pol. Ec.,
        ch. xxi, 2d ed., p. 285.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor,
        the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged
        to allow it in payment of the rent.&quot; &#8212; Adam Smith's Wealth
        of Nations, book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the
        cost of production and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
        production, and taxes upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though
        a tax upon rent compels land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power
        to obtain more for the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce
        the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land
        on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land values
        tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to reduce
        the price of land.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book viii, ch.
        iii, subd. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting
        the tax in higher rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of
        shifting it to the consumers of goods in higher prices. The principle
        is the same. Merchants cannot charge higher prices for goods than their
        competitors do, merely because they pay higher ground rents. A country
        storekeeper whose business lot is worth but few dollars charges as much
        for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer whose lot is worth thousands.
        Quality for quality and quantity for quantity, goods sell for about the
        same price everywhere. Differences in price are altogether in favor of
        places where land has a high value. This is due to the fact that the
        cost of getting goods to places of low land value, distant villages for
        example, is greater than to centers, which are places of high land value.
        Sometimes it is true that prices for some things are higher where land
        values are high. Tiffany's goods, for instance, may be more expensive
        than goods of the same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But
        that is not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has
        a reputation for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad
        among rich people), for which his customers are willing to pay whether
        his store is on a high priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Though land value has no effect upon the price of good,
        it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in others. Therefore,
        though the price and the profit of each sale be the same, or even less,
        in good locations than in poorer ones, aggregate receipts and aggregate
        profits are much greater at the good location. And it is out of his aggregate,
        and not out of each profit, that rent is paid, For example: A cigar store
        on a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality of cigar for fifteen cents.
        On a side street the same quality of cigar can be bought no cheaper.
        Indeed, the cigars there are likely to be poorer, and therefore really
        dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare is very high compared with
        ground rent on the sidestreet. How, then, can the first dealer, he who
        pays the high ground rent, afford to sell as good or better cigars for
        fifteen cents than his competitor of the low priced location? Simply
        because he is able to make so many more sales with a given outlay of
        labor and capital in a given time that his aggregate profit is greater.
        This is due to the advantage of his location, and for that advantage
        he pays a premium in higher ground rent. But that premium is not charged
        to smokers; the competing dealer of the side street protects them. It
        represents the greater ease, the lower cost, of doing a given volume
        of business upon the site for which it is paid; add if the state should
        take any of it, even the whole of it, in taxation, the loss would be
        finally borne by the owner of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by
        the landlord. Any attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would be promptly
        checked by the competition of neighboring but cheaper land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land-tax, levied in proportion to the rent of
        land, and varying with every variation of rent, is in effect a tax on
        rent; and as such a tax will not apply to that land which yields no rent,
        nor to the produce of that capital which is employed on the land with
        a view to profit merely, and which never pays rent; it will not in any
        way affect the price of raw produce, but will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; &#8212; McCulloch's
        Ricardo (3d ed.), p. 207</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</font></strong></p>
  <p>Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon
    men in proportion to their ability to pay, and (2) taxes that are levied
    in proportion to the benefits received by the tax-payer from the public.
    Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though probate and
    inheritance taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only important one
    of the second class.</p>
  <p>There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two. To tax in proportion
    to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy. The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p>But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the piratical
    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">12. It is often said, for instance, by its advocates,
        that house owners should in justice contribute to the support of the
        fire departments that protect them and it is even gravely argued that
        houses are more appropriate subjects of taxation than land; because they
        need protection, whereas land needs none. Read note 8.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>

    <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the

            are exempt from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth,
            by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by
            charitable, literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount

    <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should

            good reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
            to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an
            indication of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
            October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were
            valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report) at
            $52,712,600. I believe that this represents not more than fifty per
            cent of their true market value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property

<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q10. What is the distinction between the taxation of land and the taxation
      of rent?</em><br>
A. Taxing land means, in the ordinary use of the words, to tax the land upon
its capital value, or selling value, at a given rate per $100 or $1,000 of that
value. Taxing rent means taxing the annual value, or ground rent, at a given
percentage of that rent. It is in one case a tax on rent; in the other is a tax
on capitalized rent.</p>
  <p><em>Q15. What should be the limit of revenue under the single tax?</em><br>
A. The same as under any other system of taxation, the cost of government economically
  administered.</p>
  <p><em>Q16. Did not Henry George hold that the full ground rent of land should
      be taken in taxation?</em><br>
  A. No! Not only did he concede a margin of rent to the landlord, but as a matter
  of fact, as Thomas G. Shearman said, &quot;not all the power of all governments&quot; could
  collect in taxation all of ground rent.</p>
  <p><em>Q40. What is meant by a capitalized tax?</em><br>
A. It is a sum, the interest of which would pay the tax.</p>
  <p><em>Q62.&nbsp; Would it be wise to take gradually in taxation, say, 1/4,
      one half, or 3/4 of the future increase in economic
rent?</em><br>
A. One hundred and one professors of political
economy have answered "Yes." Twenty-nine have answered "No."<br>
<br>
<em>Q63.&nbsp; How could the single tax be put into
operation?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to land all taxes not
already on it.<br>
<br>
<em>Q64.&nbsp; How might such a plan be worked out?</em><br>
A. If fifty cents per thousand should be deducted yearly for 30 years from the
rate on all property other than land, the reduction would finally amount to $15
per thousand, and it would then
be practically exempt from all taxation.<br>
<em><br>
Q65.&nbsp; But how could it be worked out in case of
the land?</em><br>
A. Recognizing that a right thing may be done in a wrong way, it is insisted
that a right way ought to be found to do a thing that ought to be done. The following
is presented as a natural
and convenient <span style="font-style: italic;">unit of calculation</span>:
To be exact, <span style="font-style: italic;">an average of about 20 percent
of the gross ground rent of land is now taken in taxation, for instance, in Boston,
as well as for the whole state of Massachusetts. If an additional one percent
should be taken each year for 30 years, it would amount at the end of that period
to 30 percent, which, added to 20 percent, would make 50 percent, or one half,
which is about the average proportion that present taxes levied on all property
bear to gross ground rent. Meantime few landowners would feel the change, much
less be prejudiced by it.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
The following variable illustrations, A, B, and C, make clear.</p>
  <p align="center"> <span style="font-style: italic;">A "Modus Operandi"</span><br>
      <br>
  A <span style="font-style: italic;">Increase of Present Tax</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For instance, applied to the assessment of a specific lot of land for which
    the user pays a gross ground rent of say ......&nbsp; $68.00<br>
  Of which amount there is taken in taxation, 1915 ..... $18.00<br>
  <br>
  Leaving a net income to the owner of&nbsp; .... $50.00<br>
  The selling value (presumably also the assessed valuation) would be at 5 per
  cent ... $1,000.00<br>
  Proceeding to take yearly from now on 1 per cent additional of the gross ground
  rent of $68 for a period of thirty years would amount in all to 30 per cent
  of $68, equal to&nbsp;&nbsp; .... $20.40<br>
  Which, added to the tax already taken .... $18.00 <br>
  Would give at the end of thirty years, from the $1,000 worth of land alone,
  everything else being exempted, a total tax of .... $38.40.<br>
  Which is not much more than one half of the gross ground rent of ... $68.00<br>
    <br>
  The opening exhibit in detail would stand as follows:<br>
  In 1915 the tax on this $1,000 worth of land was $18.00<br>
  In 1916 the tax would be $18 plus 68 cents (1 per cent of the gross ground
  rent, $68); equal to .... $18.68<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $49.32<br>
  In 1917 the tax would be $18 plus $1.36 (2 per cent of the $68), totaling ....
  $19.36<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $48.64,<br>
  In 1918 the tax would be $18 plus $2.04 (3 per cent of the $68) or $20.45<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $47.96<br>
  In 1945 the tax on the land would be $18 plus $20.40 (30 per cent of the $68)
  or&nbsp; ... $38.40<br>
  With all improvements exempted.<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $29.60.<br>
  <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">For a Future Increment Tax</span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
  <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>The taking in taxation of any desired
  proportion of the future increment could be accomplished simply by continuing
  the present valuation and present rate as constant factors, and making a separate
  individual assessment of the increment tax after the following or similar formula,
  according to the proportion to be taken.&nbsp; For instance, to take in taxation
  50 per cent of the future increase:<br>

In applying this formula it would be necessary after the first few years at least
to increase the rate to correspond to the decrease in assessed valuation due
to this new tax.&nbsp; For computations upon
this and related points, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Report of

It should be reiterated that inasmuchas gross ground rent, actual or potential,
is the initial factor in getting at the value of land, it cannot be unprofitable
to become familiar with a more correct formula
as expressed in terms of rent.<br>
