<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
  limit. <strong>Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation,
  if the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
  not
  be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.</strong>  Taxes
  could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
  and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained in
  this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York a more
  desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that <strong>heat and
  light</strong> could
  be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied to each house
  at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual effort,
  or that the <strong>city railroads</strong> could be run at public expense
  so as to give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs
  the average resident,
  the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be increased
  burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York would become
  a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn taxation as bad
  merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional provision,
  as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our States has
  been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction upon
  the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is the far-reaching
  statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his proposition that
  all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain brief term &#8212; a
  proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth that the earth belongs
  in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have no control over it, and can
  give no title to any part of it. But restriction upon public debts is a very
  different thing from restriction upon the power of taxation, and reasons which
  urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor is increased taxation necessarily
  proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in taxation is in the order of
  social development, for the reason that social development tends to the doing
  of things collectively that in a ruder state are done individually, to the
  giving to government of new functions and the imposing of new duties. Our public
  schools and libraries and parks, our signal service and fish commissions and
  agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations, are evidences of this.... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The airwaves, also known as the broadcast spectrum, are a gift of nature
    that modern technology has turned into a valuable resource. As a medium for
    sharing information and ideas, airwaves have enormous advantages over paper
    and wires. The problem in the early days was that signals often interfered
    with one another. If two nearby transmitters used the same or adjacent frequencies,
    a radio listener would hear two sound streams simultaneously. America&#8217;s
    approach to this problem (though not Britain&#8217;s or Canada&#8217;s) was
    to give free exclusive local frequencies to private broadcasters, subject
    to periodic hearings and renewal.</p>
  <p>The quid pro quo for this gift, according to the Communications Act of 1934,
    was that broadcasters would serve &#8220;the public interest, convenience,
    and necessity&#8221; &#8212; whatever that might mean. The airwaves themselves
    would remain, in theory, public property, with the Federal Communications
    Commission (again in theory) acting as trustee.</p>
  <p>Private broadcasters grew large and profitable under this arrangement. But
    over time, as their advertising revenues soared, their public-interest obligations
    declined. In the 1980s, the FCC dropped the Fairness Doctrine, which required
    broadcasters to air both sides of controversial issues. Educational programming
    also waned. In the 1990s the spread of cell phones created huge new demand
    for airwaves. Instead of giving frequencies to cell phone companies for free,
    Congress wisely chose to auction them, raising billions of dollars for the
    federal treasury. Broadcasters, however, lobbied hard for more free spectrum,
    and in 1996 Congress gave it to them, ostensibly for digital TV. This was
    the $70 billion giveaway I described earlier. Today, digital technology makes
    it possible for &#8220;smart&#8221; receivers to pick out only the signals
    they need. Signal interference thus is, or soon could be, a thing of the
    past &#8212; which makes exclusive licenses unnecessary. The airwaves could
    be an open access commons with virtually no capacity limits, a possibility
    that makes broadcasters, phone, and cable companies extremely anxious.</p>
  <p>Some broadcasters have another idea. They want to privatize the airwaves,
    with ownership assigned to them. Under this plan, the free licenses they
    received for digital TV would become permanent entitlements usable for any
    purpose. Broadcasters could then sell their entitlements to cell phone companies
    and pocket the windfall. The big winners would be General Electric (NBC),
    Disney (ABC), and Rupert Murdoch (Fox). Other beneficiaries would include
    Pat Robertson (Christian Broadcasting Network) and Lowell &#8220;Bud&#8221; Paxson
    (Pax TV). When a reporter asked Paxson why he should receive millions of
    dollars for selling the public&#8217;s airwaves, he replied: &#8220;I was
    a farmer and I got lucky. Now people want to build a mall on my farm. God
    bless America.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If Congress treated the airwaves as a common asset, it would lease most
    of them at market rates for limited terms to the highest bidders. The billions
    of dollars thus raised could buy free airtime for political candidates, fund
    noncommercial radio and TV, and help sustain the arts.</p>
  <p><strong>Alternatively, Congress could turn the airwaves into an open access
      commons like roads and streets. Using technologies like wi-fi (wireless
      fidelity),
    everyone could enjoy high-speed Internet access for almost nothing. As of
    early 2006, nearly 150 U.S. cities were deploying or planning public wi-fi
    networks.</strong> These efforts are hampered by the fact that the frequencies allotted
    to wi-fi don&#8217;t travel as far, or penetrate buildings as well, as do
    the frequencies given to broadcasters. A bill to open unused TV channels
    for wi-fi has been introduced by a group of senators, but it faces stiff
    opposition from broadcasters, telephone, and cable companies.</p>
  <p><strong>The Internet</strong></p>
  <p>The Internet is a human-made commons that, for all intents and purposes,
    can be used without limit. It&#8217;s arguably the most remarkable technological
    achievement of the twentieth century, given that it revolutionizes commerce,
    community, and culture in one swoop. As with other valuable commons, it&#8217;s
    coveted by private corporations. The battle in coming years will be between
    those who want to privatize big chunks of the Internet, and those (including
    many corporations) who want it to be as free, universal, and open as possible.
    What&#8217;s unusual is that this is one of the few battlegrounds where those
    on the side of the commons have an early edge.</p>
  <p><strong>One looming battle concerns access &#8212; in particular, bridging the &#8220;last
    mile&#8221; between the Internet and the millions of people (billions worldwide)
    who could use it, but now don&#8217;t. When the Internet began, the last
    mile was typically crossed by telephone. A user would dial up an Internet
    server and log on. However, because telephone wires were sized for voice
    signals, they can&#8217;t carry high volumes of data at high speeds.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In due time, cable companies began offering their thicker cables
      to Internet users. Phone companies also came up with a system &#8212; DSL &#8212; that
    squeezes more data through their skinny wires. There are thus now two good
    ways to get high-speed access to the Internet &#8212; if you can afford roughly
    $30 a month, or $360 a year. Since not everyone can afford this, however,
    we have what some people call a digital divide &#8212; a financial barrier
    to universal access.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>This is where the airwaves come in. Using digital signals, it&#8217;s now
    possible to bridge the last mile to the Internet through the public&#8217;s
    own airwaves. Not only that, it&#8217;s incredibly cheap to do so, using
    technologies like wi-fi. At the same time, another technical breakthrough
    is imminent: the Internet &#8212; including this last wireless mile &#8212; will
    soon be &#8220;thick&#8221; enough to carry data, telephone calls, and television
    pictures. In theory, a small public investment could bring all these services
    to the doorsteps of virtually everyone. There&#8217;d be no more need for
    private TV networks, telephone and cable companies. The so-called information
    highway would be, like public streets, truly open and free.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>This is an extraordinary possibility. Americans now pay some $300
      billion a year for telephone and cable services; perhaps half of this could
      be saved.
    That&#8217;s the equivalent of raising every worker&#8217;s take-home pay
    by about $1,000 a year. It should be cause for celebration.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>What&#8217;s more, free universal Internet access would be a boon to the
    corporate side of the economy &#8212; another example of a commons having
    positive external benefits. Think of an urban shopping street, or Main Street
    in a small town. Merchants on these streets depend on foot traffic; the more
    passersby, the more sales they make. If someone put checkpoints or tollbooths
    on these streets, merchants would scream. So it is with the Internet. Everyone
    doing business on the Internet wants more traffic. Making the Internet free
    to all would be the best thing that ever happened to merchants.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Except, of course, for the phone-and-cable duopoly. In several states,
      these powerful companies have pushed through laws prohibiting cities from
      offering
    wireless Internet service, and they&#8217;ve sponsored a similar ban in Congress.
    The companies say their right to profit trumps the consumer&#8217;s right
    to save money and a city&#8217;s right to serve its citizens. Many politicians
    still buy that argument, so the end of this story has yet to be written.</strong></p>
  <p>A similar battle looms over what&#8217;s called &#8220;net neutrality.&#8221; At
    the moment, the Internet &#8212; like the telephone system &#8212; treats
    all content equally. No one&#8217;s data is discriminated against, and no
    one&#8217;s gets favored either &#8212; your personal webste is treated the
    same as Google&#8217;s. However, cable and phone companies want to create
    a two-tiered Internet, with some content providers getting slow speed and
    others &#8212; who pay the phone and cable companies &#8212; getting high
    speed. That would mean more revenue for the companies, but also a permanent
    divide between corporate content providers and everyone else.</p>
  <p>Congress is now considering bills both to allow and to ban such tiering,
    and the outcome as this is written is uncertain.</p>
