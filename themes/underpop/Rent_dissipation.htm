of Rent</strong></p>
<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_Cannan.html">A Cannan Gets the
Range </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edwin Cannan (1861-1935)</span> is best known
    for his 1904 edition of <b><i>The Wealth of Nations</i></b>. His other best-known
    work is a <b><i>History of Theories of Production and Distribution</i></b>,
    1893. His book most relevant here is <b><i>History of Local Rates in England</i></b>,
    1896. He was Professor at the London School of Economics, 1907-26, although
    a large inherited fortune let him reside at Oxford and dabble at London part-time.
    He criticized both Marshall and Keynes, although without much effect. His later
    work drew little enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>In 1907 Cannan fired off a round at local rating of site values. It hit
    home. First he recited the logic of what today we call the "tragedy of the commons" (it
    was common coin long before Garrett Hardin). Then he pointed out that a city
    taxing only site values to provide free public services would attract too many
    people and too much capital. A city is an "open economy," free to immigration
    of everything but land, something like an open range or fishery. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Even if all cities tax only site values, cities with
    more rents per head may support public services at higher levels, and so attract
    immigrants. This distorts locational decisions, attracting people to jobs of
    lesser productivity where they may gain from better public services. This is "Cannan's
    Law."</span></p>
  <p>There are three bad results from Cannan's Law. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>One is an uneconomical distribution of population, as cities with more
          rentable lands attract more of mobile labor and capital than they should. </b> That
          is not to deny that people are attracted to New York for good economic
          reasons. Rather, it is that distributing economic rent freely to all
          comers attracts people above and beyond the good economic reasons.
          Thus, people
          move to New York to earn high wages, well and good; but in addition
          they may receive a high quality college education from CCNY, the "poor man's
          Harvard," paid from local property taxes. In the glory days of the
          Mesabi iron range, children of immigrant Finnish miners there in Hibbing,
          Minnesota,
          enjoyed some of the best schooling in the country, paid from local
          property taxes on iron ore. In Alaska and Alberta, workers receive
          high wages to
          overcome the harsh climate, remote locations, and other disamenities.
          That is economically sound, but in addition they get a cash dividend
          each year
          from the overflowing oil revenues. All that tends to draw more people,
          like flies swarming to fresh pie, than the wages warrant.</li>
    <li><b>A second bad result is what economists call "dissipation of economic
          rent." </b> To make it simple, consider a rich but crowded fishery
          where another fishing boat added to the crowd will not raise the total
          catch
          at all, but simply take fish from other crews who were already there.
          Interlopers will keep entering until the average boat and crew just
          make costs, leaving
          no net rent for anyone. This has long been standard economic lore.
          As Cannan writes, if a locality uses its rents to benefit all its "inhabitants," people
          will flock to the richest places until there is no further gain to
          immigrants because they have wiped out all the rent. </li>
    <li><b>A third bad result of Cannan's Law is to lower the incentive of local
          governments to provide public services that are open to all comers.</b> It
          fosters local institutions and attitudes that are harshly hostile to
          newcomers and outsiders, especially to the poor, young, homeless, hungry,
          and vagrant.
          As Woody Guthrie, the Okie bard, sang of California, "Believe it or not,
          you won't find it so hot, if you ain't got that do-re-mi." That was
          in 1935; it is truer today.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cannan goes on to say that if we are to tax site values, the tax should
    be national. It is not clear how sincere he is -- his style is carping, condescending,
    elitist and unsympathetic. Still, his logic implies it, and he does say it,
    however grudgingly. On this point the great Alfred Marshall agreed, in a
    positive
    spirit (positive, that is, for Marshall, a famously "two-handed" economist).

<blockquote>
  <p>          <b>A. Dissipation
    means waste and destruction or suppression.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It means incurring needless costs, or aborting surplus-yielding activities.
        Redistribution is not, per se, dissipation. No incentive is required to produce
        land, or able to make more be created, so who collects rent is a distributive
        choice. However the manner of collection may twist incentives and interfere
      with efficient use; so may the method of tenure, or tenure-creation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>B. How rent is dissipated.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Open access, tragedy of commons. Arthur Young, Scott Gordon, Garrett
        Hardin, et al. Simple cases like open range, fisheries, public parks and beaches,
      freeways: a principle easily perceived (although not usually by undergraduates).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>C. Open access followed by
      tenure: rent-seeking institutions.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rent is dissipated through prematurity of investments. Squatters'
        Rights (<b>Preemption Act of 1841</b>), and residence requirement of <b>Homestead
        Act (1862)</b>, traditional examples. Prior appropriation doctrine of water
        rights, simple example. Air routes; broadcast licenses; extending utility franchises;
        zoning; offset rights to pollute; other modern examples.
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset rights to pollute are doubly effective
            in dissipating rent.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">By generating a nuisance and lowering the
            value of surrounding land, a polluter is rewarded by receiving a valuable
          vested right to continue the nuisance in perpetuity, or sell it.</span></p>
    <p>Internationally, rent-seeking via warfare, or big-stick policies threatening
        warfare, may be seen to dissipate rent when we deduct the public cost from
      the private gain.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open access to exploration, followed by claims, as in minerals act
        of 1872.</li>
      <li>Noncompetitive leasing (free entry, first-come-first-served) as in
        Alaska until fairly recent times.</li>
      <li>Open access for preliminary forms of exploration, followed by leases
            for exploratory drilling.</li>
      <li>Leasing on demand ("nomination"), i.e. at the convenience of the first
            potential lessee, rather than the lessor. In conjunction with the bonus
            bid system, leasing on demand puts a premium on financial or front-money
            power as the triggering force. It also puts a premium on sequestering
          information and treating it as proprietary, and forcing as much duplication
          of effort
          as there are competitors.</li>
      <li>Subsidizing exploration. A subsidy, almost by definition, causes waste
            in the amount of the subsidy, by causing people to spend more to produce
            things than they are worth. With minerals, subsidies cause submarginal
            lands to be developed. Submarginal in this case generally means "premature," since
            rising scarcity probably means the submarginal will eventually become
          superior.</li>
      <li>Direct subsidies</li>
      <li>Tax preferences (a long list). I premise the tax-subsidy concept, i.e.
              that those who pay less taxes on the supposed principle of taxation
        are being subsidized by others who pay more.</li>
      <li>Unlimited license to acquire leaseholds. Gale Johnson, Stephen Cheung
              and others have shown the rational landlord may make a system of
          share tenancy work only if he limits the land each tenant may have. State
          and
              Federal lessors generally impose royalties and other charges on a
          unit-of-production basis, so their lessees are share-croppers; but they
          put no upper limit
              on leasehold acquisition.
          <p>There are time limits on holding without producing, but these may
                be met by token compliance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Leverage of private investment over public investment and public services.</li>
      <li>Tolerating environmental damage without compensation. Minerals exploration,
              transportation, refining and consumption all receive heavy subsidies
        of this kind. (However, cf. #14, Goldplating.)</li>
      <li>Subsidizing consumption.</li>
      <li>Providing highways below cost.</li>
      <li>Underpricing gas and power at the margins, by melding and cross-subsidy.</li>
      <li>Subsidizing energy-intensive water projects. Etc., not quite ad infinitum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Slowing down use and extraction of minerals once discovered. In tandem with
        incentives to premature exploration, this generates an unduly capital-freezing
        industry. It attracts capital too soon, and releases it too slowly. In the
      Austrian sense, it becomes too capital-intensive.</p>
    <p>Freezing up capital is not free. To justify each year capital is frozen,
        interest must be paid. This wasted interest comes out of rent, in the form
      of lower bids for leaseholds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Severance taxation</li>
      <li>MER-based regulation of production</li>

      <p>7. Economies of scale are all that matter, and all activities are like
              newspaper publishing in this regard. This does tend to affect the attitude
            of editors who sway opinion.</p>

    groups. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Environmental protection, like other good things, may be carried
          to excess in specific cases like the Wilmington Basin. That is no basis for
          generalizing, however, and it is obviously underfinanced in other cases like
        tanker spillage.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3. Overextension of subeconomic feeder lines, cross-subsidized.</p>
    <p>4. Selling at the wrong time. A good deal of early Alaska oil was sold,
      not that long ago, for $1/bbl netback to the wellhead.</p>
    <p>5. Looting. Looting per se is only redistributive in the short run, but
      its destructive incentive effects are obvious.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Looting is sporadic, but the total ongoing cost of guarding against
        crime is an enormous drain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>6. Rent control in cities; price control at the wellhead. Both these are
      redistributive in intent and effect, but highly destructive of good incentives.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Wellhead price control of gas has been turned into a subsidy for
        exploring for new gas, via melding costs in gas rate regulation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>7. Taxes and lease provisions that twist incentives.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>IV. Dissipating rent via
      public spending</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p name="A. Taxes and lease provisions n"><b>A. Taxes and lease
          provisions need not twist incentives. </b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. At worst taxes destroy incentives only at the margins: the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">wedge
                effect</span>."
      </p>
      <p>2. Taxes may be structured to zero in on taxable surplus while sparing
            the margins. An obvious and well-discussed case is a tax based on land
            value, or putative rent, imposed as a flat charge unaffected by landowner
          production.</p>
      <p>3. Taxes in excess of benefits received have positive incentive effects
          on landowners.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. The wealth effect
        </p>
        <p>b. The liquidity or cash-drain effect.</p>
        <p>c. The effect of offsetting credit discrimination and rationing (land
                  is cheaper to buy, hence less credit is needed, and taxes are or may
                be non-discriminatory among potential owners.)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So it is not taxation per se that dissipates rent, even though ill-structured
        taxes do destroy some rent.</p>
    <p><b>B. Public spending of
          tax proceeds may dissipate rent</b>.</p>
    <p>Jurisdictions with higher rents/capita may support public services at
          a higher level, and so attract immigrants. This distorts locational decisions,
          attracting people to low-productivity, low-paying jobs where they may benefit
        from higher public services.</p>
    <p><b>C. History of recognition
            of this spending effect</b></p>
    <p>We are not the first to have noticed!</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. James Madison.</span> U.S.
            Constitution blocked direct taxes on land at Federal level, allowed it
            at state and local. Also guaranteed free migration among and within states.
      </p>
      <p>Madison's rationale was the self-interest of local voters would then
              keep them from redistributing rents.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Edwin Cannan.</span> Around 1900
                the ideas of Henry George were powerful in the U.K., and adopted by
                the Liberal Party. George, of course, spoke and wrote in favor of rent-sharing
                via tax and spending policy. Cannan wrote in the EJ that heavy local
                taxes on land rents, used to provide superior public services, would
              distort locational incentives and cause overpopulation in London.</p>
      <p>This is a tragedy-of-commons once-removed. Land remains tenured, but
                schools, parks, welfare, streets, libraries, public restrooms, public
              ambiance, etc. are open to all.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred Marshall </span>seconded Cannan,
                shifting the argument however to the suburbs which he thought would
                become overpopulated. Marshall, by the way, came around to favoring
                a national land tax, in spite of Stigler's resurrection of his acrimony
              with travelling agitator Henry George at Oxford.</p>
      <p>Neither George, Cannan nor Marshall got into exclusionary local zoning,
              a later and highly relevant development.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Half-brothers Austen and Neville
                  Chamberlain</span>, arch-foes of land taxation, adopted the Madison
                  principle of stifling it by relegating it to local jurisdictions
                only, letting forces of local particularism limit its use.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Upton Sinclair</span> learned
                the force of this principle in 1933. In his <i>How I ran for Governor
                of California and How I got Licked</i> he reports his EPIC campaign
              nearly won until the enemy found the formula of anti-Okie-ism.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. B.C. offsets the magnet of Vancouver's
                  location and public facilities by costly Provincial efforts to subsidize
                  less attractive cities at Vancouver's expense.</span> Nationally,
                Canada does the same with Alberta oil revenues.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Canada's effort is still too little to placate Quebec,
                giving a notion of the limits of purely fiscal measures to overpower
                cultural factors. While this may discourage the purely allocative economist,
                it contains a seed of hope for those interested in ethics and justice,
                indicating narrow pecuniary self-interest is not everything. There
                is some pleasure in contemplating a people who will not sell out so
              cheaply (and perhaps not at all).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Alaska,</span> of course, lost
                out to the ghost of Madison when it gave a social dividend to all residents
                with five years in the State, and was successfully sued (Zobel v. Williams,
              102 USSC 2309, 1982).</p>

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The Taxable Surplus
    of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering
  It</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small></small></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Common Property in Land is Compatible with the
    Market Economy.</p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> You can enjoy the benefits of a market
  economy without sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There
  is no need to make a hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies
  that western economists and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to
  give up one to enjoy the other. These counselors work through lending and granting
  agencies that seduce you with loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology,
  which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is glitter
to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">To keep
land common while shifting to a market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common property
takes in a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and how;
but in
the answers lie success or failure.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can you have both common land and
    free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go together, like
    love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help identify land's
    taxable surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
    costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At the same time, you
    must support government from land revenues to have a truly free market, because
    otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade, and capital formation,
    interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn this second point, and
    act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the OECD nations
    that now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
    make all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
    own abysmal systems.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire
-- the slogan at the core of a free market economy -- made communizing land rents
a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith, and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation.
They
accurately called it the "co-proprietorship of land by the state." <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have learned to measure
land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources. </span>Agrarians will
be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks well down
the list in terms of total market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a
tax on farms; only the very best soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus. </span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
The most valuable land by far is city land. Ted Gwartney, a professional land
valuer, is
speaking to us about that. I have
data showing that <span style="font-weight: bold;">well over half the value of
city real estate is the
pure land value</span>. In big, key cities, prices per unit of land go astonishingly
high, dwarfing most other values by comparison. For example, at the height of
the Japanese boom, in 1990, land prices in that great city rose so high that
the appraised value of the land under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was as great
as all the land in California! At the same time, within California, most of the
land value was in our cities, even though California is the premier farm state
in the U.S.A. Urban land of such immense value makes a rich, rich tax base for
you, or any nation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of communication its value is vaulting skywards
even faster than the rockets launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each satellite requires
a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected
a bundle of spectrum rights for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to
AT&amp;T for $12 billions. Then Mr. McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps
the richest American, in a firm called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites
and amass radio spectrum rights around the entire world, including your part
of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio spectrum
is a natural resource, and it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell anything cheap! In
fact, don't sell anything at all, but lease it for a limited time, so you may
gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease contracts are complex,
and
are worth billions if you play your cards right. </span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set of
valuable resources.</span> The values involved are gigantic. The recent merger
of the Exxon and Mobil oil firms was valued at $260 billions, several times greater
than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private parties make off
with all this natural value?</span> Several nations, including some of your neighbors,
support themselves entirely from these revenues. Norway pays for a lush welfare
state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are so valuable that the mere change
in their appraised value in several recent years has exceeded the entire GDP
of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your production, they may be
the largest in the world. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but there is another side to
this. The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your oil in Russian
terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting "windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective way to tax resource
rents. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska holds down its
other taxes by socializing part of its oil revenues, which otherwise would inure
to a handful of the major stockholders of two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska
not only holds down other taxes, it pays each resident - man, woman, and child
- a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span> Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri
Lvov from the Russian Academy of Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written
that you could cover most of your national budget from your enormous production
of oil
and gas. &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like Venezuela or
Nigeria have fabulous mineral oil that they fail to exploit for their own people,
letting sophisticated or ruthless foreign corporations, in tandem with weak or
corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The question for Russia is whether to follow their bad
example and become a poor resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your
own sovereignty over your own resources for the benefit of your own people. You
need
look no further than
Norway for a model. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have great
value, too.</span> Many nations, even backward ones, gain large parts of their
national revenue from "hardrock" minerals. Bolivia, Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia,
New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea, Zaire, and Zambia have raised over 25% of their
budgets this way in recent years; Chile, Thailand and Malaysia have taken lesser,
but substantial amounts. Saskatchewan, a Canadian Province, raises large revenues
from potash and uranium; Minnesota, an American state, from iron ore; and so
on. Some other nations fail to raise much revenue from fabulous minerals from
which others profit, like S. Africa with its gold and diamonds, West Virginia
with its coal, or Missouri with its lead mines and reserves. Russia is a treasure-house
of untapped mineral wealth that you can and should tax to alleviate the condition
of the Russian
people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life, and the most
valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For example, in southern California we need
water so much we import it from the Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump
it uphill through the long San Joaquin Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain
range, and tunnel it through the San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great
cost. When it gets here, it supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay
for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus
we turn a public asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly that
is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past time we learned
to husband and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the surplus.
So should you, in
comparable circumstances. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span> Again, California witlessly fails to socialize this value,
but Canada, our northern neighbor, has shown the way. British Columbia, Newfoundland
(the Labrador part), Quebec, and other provinces raise large revenues from charges
on the use of falling water. Russia, with some of the world's largest hydro-electric
projects, can do the
same, or better. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of value.</span> In
the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect "privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents, where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good example of husbanding and guarding rent, which
is necessary before you can collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however,
to
give away this net benefit
to private parties. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell these licenses,
but simply gave them away to owners of existing boats, and others with political
influence. Each license now sells for something like a million dollars, creating
a new class of
instant millionaires and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway from the many, created an instant class society
where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These privileges
are worth so much that there are now documented cases off Alaska where the parlor
fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work
and bear the dangers and discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get
by with the other 30%. Parlor fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should
be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">The Constitutional
    Conflict Between Protecting Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<p>The Russian Mafia today can be understood, in many cases, as promoting efficient
  resource allocation by preventing the dissipation of rent through competition.
  For example, Old Arbat Street in Moscow was for many years a place where artists
  would sell their wares to tourists. But to operate there, artists were required
  to pay the Mafia gang that controlled the street. The fees collected by the
  Mafia served to ration the space to an efficient number of artists. Without
  that rationing device, there would have been an excess of artists crowding
  the street and interfering with each other inefficiently. And people would
  have been getting up at 2:00 in the morning to get space before anyone else
  claimed it. In these circumstances, the Mafia action served to prevent the
  dissipation of the rent and did not reduce the net incomes of artists. If there
  were no public-good aspects of the provision of art, it could be argued that
  complete efficiency was achieved by this "spontaneous" private appropriation
of rent.</p>
<p>The person who wishes to abolish such exploitative institutions as slavery,
  autocratic governments and Mafia protection schemes, without compensation for
  those who derive income from them, can be asked to explain why it is right
  to terminate these incomes without compensation, when the development of the
  institutions served to improve allocative efficiency. </p>
<p>The answer comes in two parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part of the answer is that slavery, autocratic government, Mafia protection
    and other exploitive institutions are second-bests. Slavery may be better
    than the killing of those who are defeated in war, but magnanimity by victors,
    or an end to war, are better. And once slavery starts, it generates enslavements
    of the weak who would otherwise be safe. Autocratic government may be better
    than suffering the predations of roving bandits, but government that reflects
    a sense of community among the governed is certainly better. Mafia protection
    of Old Arbat Street artists may be better than chaotic appropriation of selling
    space, but public collection of rent for the use of selling space is better.
    The fact that these institutions may be improvements on what would otherwise
    have existed does not imply that they should continue to exist when yet better
    institutions become feasible.</li>
  <li>The second part of the answer is that if one is tempted to suppose that
    the income from the indefinite duration of an exploitive institution is needed
    to induce people to invest efficiently in creating the institution, that
    temptation should be resisted. If the developer of an exploitive institution
    were able to capture exactly the full increase in aggregate income from its
    development, and if the profit in developing such an institution depended
    on receiving the increase in income for all eternity and not just until a
    better institution became feasible, and if the time when the better institution
    became feasible was independent of whether the first institution was developed,
    then it would not be worthwhile to develop the institution in the first place.
    In these circumstances a right in perpetuity is like a perpetual patent on
    something that would have been discovered by someone else if not by its first
    inventor. In the same way that a perpetual patent can motivate excessive
    expenditures on inventive activity, a perpetual right to benefit from an
    exploitive institution induces excessive investments in exploitation. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">read the whole article</a></li>
