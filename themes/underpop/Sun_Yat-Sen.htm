  <p>The German colony of Kiaochow, China, established in 1898, had a single
    tax on land value set at 6 percent.35 Its principal city, Tsing-tao, developed
    into a fine modern city. The Germans lost the colony in 1914 at the outbreak
    of World War I, but their experience influenced the Chinese revolutionary
    Sun
    Yat-Sen, who became head of the government of China. He and his successors
    in the Nationalist Party were not able to implement land value taxation in
    that country, but when they moved to Taiwan in 1950 after the communists
    took the mainland, Chiang-Kai Shek implemented a land-to-the-tiller reform
    accompanied
    by a tax on land value. Taiwan has since developed into a major industrial
    power. Hong Kong and Singapore became major commercial centers in large part
    because much of their public finance is based on taxing land values, or in
    the case of Hong Kong, from selling land leases, with low taxes on trade
    and commerce. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

    Yat Sen's Three Principles</a>,  
[Reprinted from the Henry George News, June, 1970]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WHETHER revolutions make men or men make revolutions is as debatable today
    as it was when Thomas Carlyle stated the case during the period of the French
    Revolution. But one cannot deny that a revolution usually has some individual
    closely associated with it. We tend to connect Washington with the American
    Revolution, Lenin with the Russian Revolution and Castro with the Cuban Revolution.</p>
  <p>Sun Yat Sen seems to belong to the Chinese Revolution of 1911, for after more
    than two thousand years of dynastic rule, China, amid the turmoil and chaos
    of the Manchu dynasty, established its first Republic. And with the emergence
    of this revolutionary government one man stood out as the leader - Sun Yat
    Sen.</p>
  <p>Prior to 1911 Sun Yat Sen traveled widely, spending some time in Japan and
    the United States. Influenced by western concepts of industrialization, he
    carried back to his native land ideas that differed from those normally prevalent
    in Chinese culture. These ideas affected ensuing events in a significant way.</p>
  <p>Of particular importance was his book <em>San Min Chui</em>, or <em>Three
      Principles of the People</em>. This work is still popular among the Chinese and it cuts across
    political lines. The proposed reform was embodied in what he called the peoples'
    principle, and the plans were to be altered or revised as the revolution took
    various turns.</p>
  <p>His concepts of nationalism and democracy appealed to the dignity and loyalty
    of the Chinese and strengthened them in their resolve to rid themselves of
    all foreign powers and gain the respect of the international community. Democracy
    was envisioned to rest with the wishes of the people as interpreted through
    their leadership.</p>
  <p>The principle of livelihood, his third important contribution, was Sun's hope
    of achieving a desirable living standard for the Chinese based on an equalization
    of land ownership and regulation of capital. When he was asked what the policy
    of China was he responded, <strong>&quot;We propose that the government shall
    levy a tax proportionate to the price of the land, and if necessary buy back
    the
    land according to its price.&quot;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>According to this formula the landowners could set the value, and if the value
      was excessive the landowner would have to pay high taxes. If the value set
      was too low the government would buy the property. From this point forward
      all increases in land value would go to the community and increases in value
      would help defray the costs of government.</strong></p>
  <p>Since Sun's ideas were influenced partially by Henry George and partially
    by Karl Marx, he advocated that the state should regulate capital and serve
    as a source of promoting industry. He disagreed with Marx's analysis of class
    struggle however, and attempted to reconcile parts of both systems.</p>
  <p>Sun's program was not carried out during his lifetime but it is ironical that
    the Chinese Communists have been influenced by some of the thoughts concerning
    the state regulation of capital, and the Nationalist Chinese have incorporated
    some of his basic views on the equalization of land ownership. </p>

<p><em>New York Times</em> article, April 6, 1912:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Single Tax Attracts Orient<br>
</strong><strong><em>Dr. Sen's Advocacy Due to Missionaries, Says Henry George, Jr.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Representative Henry George, Jr., has been in correspondence with reformers
      in China, and the news that Dr. Sun Yat-Sen had begun an active campaign
    to institute the single tax in China was no surprise to him. </p>
  <p>When Mr. George, who maintains a correspondence with single tax leaders in
      all parts of the world, was asked what he knew about Dr. Dun's declaration,
      he replied:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I have known, by private correspondence for some time, that Dr.
      Sun had not only read 'Progress and Poverty,' my father's book, but was
      an ardent
        believer
          in its teachings. </p>
    <p>&quot;Fortunately for the pressure upon his time, Dr. Sun found a translation
        of the book that suited him well. It was made by Dr. Macklin, an American
        missionary,
          who for years has been carrying the Bible in one hand and 'Progress
      and Poverty' in the other, preaching the Gospel from the one and equal
      rights
        for all of
          God's children to God's earth out of the other.</p>
    <p>&quot;Dr. Sun seized upon this Macklin translation and stimulated its
      circulation among the thinkers of the Chinese revolution. </p>
    <p>&quot;It is a curious fact that in this movement toward the single tax
      China is following the lead of Japan. Dr. Garst was as enthusiastic over
      'Progress
        and
          Poverty' as Macklin, and talked to the young Japanese in and out of
      the missionary movement.</p>
    <p>&quot;One of the men who was directly, or indirectly at least, reached
      by Garst was Baron Saketani, who, through the Japanese-Russian war and
      until
        quite recently
          was Minister of Finance. Baron Saketani openly advocated the taxation
      of land values in preference to any other kind of tax for revenue purposes,
        and introduced
          a bill in the Japanese Diet with this end in view. The big landlords,
      together
          with the big army and the big navy advocates, were too strong for him,
        however; and before he could initiate this movement he was compelled
      to give up his
          portfolio in the Cabinet.</p>
    <p>&quot;From the movement initiated in Japan and China larger things will
        grow in the future. Japan can raise enough revenue from her land alone
      to meet all
          the expenses of Government without taxing any improvements, personal
      property, incomes, or inheritances, and without any tariff exercise or
      other sort
        of taxation. </p>
    <p>&quot;It will be seen, therefore, that the American missionaries carried
        a great economic idea into the Far East, and while they taught the Gospel
        they also
          taught the Oriental peoples how better to get a living.</p>
    <p>&quot;It will be a very remarkable thing in the history of the world if
        the United States of America shall be so slow in her economic progress
      that China and
          Japan shall show her the way to economic freedom.</p>
    <p>&quot;Dr. Sun has shown an extraordinary understanding of the Chinese
      revolution in addressing himself to the establishment not only of a people's
      government,
          based upon the people's rule, but by going deeper and addressing himself
        to the business of every Chinaman relative to the question of earning
      his daily
          bread. By attempting to life the load of taxation from the backs of
      the hundreds of millions of Chinese laborers and concentrating the whole
      tax
        burden on the
          back of landlordism, he is, at one stroke, liberating production and
      burdening landlordism. He encourages production and discourages land concentration.&quot;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Taiwan </b>is another place that "did
    it," in part. Its present government is what remains of the Kuomintang, founded
    by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the mainland around 1920. Sun's ideas were abandoned
    to corruption until the Kuomintang's remnants, discredited and beaten, fled
    to Taiwan in 1948. Then finally, backs to the wall, they purified themselves.
    They put Sun's visage on their currency and buildings, and beatified him.
    They created an efficient, honest government and applied the policies Dr.
    Sun had prescribed long ago for all China. Sun's basic economic program was
    simple. He was a convert to the ideas of Henry George, which were stirring
    the world in Sun's formative years. Tax the land; exempt the buildings, said
    Dr. Sun. That is what Taiwan finally did; the Taiwanese economic miracle
    ensued. It is there to see and study. Them as has eyes t'see, let'm see. &nbsp;</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It's not that simple, of course, and certainly
    not that pure: nothing ever is. That is the gist of it, however. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">As to adequacy of revenues, they have combined their
    local land tax with a national tax on land gains, levied at time of sale.
    These two taxes between them raise a full 20% of all Taiwanese revenues:
    local, regional, and national. </span>Remember we are talking about a government
    under siege, with a heavy military budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We
    are talking about land prices that keep rising in spite of taxes levied on
    the land value base.</span> Again, it is there to observe. It is not in America,
    true: it is even better. It is an American export that took root and flourishes
    in an alien culture because it answers universal needs. Among the Chinese
    it also evoked memories of revered statesmen and philosophers, like Wang
    An-shih, who had implemented land taxation to abet China's ancient glories.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
