<blockquote>
  <p>How do we live together in peace and justice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
      Increasing Importance of Social Questions</a> (Chapter 1 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
      Problems</a></em></strong>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[09]</font> And so come new dangers. The
    rude society resembles the creatures that though cut into pieces will live;
    the highly civilized society is like a highly organized animal: a stab in
    a vital part, the suppression of a single function, is death. A savage village
    may be burned and its people driven off &#8212; but, used to direct recourse
    to nature, they can maintain themselves. Highly civilized man, however, accustomed
    to capital, to machinery, to the minute division of labor, becomes helpless
    when suddenly deprived of these and thrown upon nature. Under the factory
    system, some sixty persons, with the aid of much costly machinery, cooperate
    to the making of a pair of shoes. But, of the sixty, not one could make a
    whole shoe. This is the tendency in all branches of production, even in agriculture.
    How many farmers of the new generation can use the flail? How many farmers'
    wives can now make a coat from the wool? Many of our farmers do not even
    make their own butter or raise their own vegetables! There is an enormous
    gain in productive power from this division of labor, which assigns to the
    individual the production of but a few of the things, or even but a small
    part of one of the things, he needs, and makes each dependent upon others
    with whom he never comes in contact; but the social organization becomes
    more sensitive. A primitive village community may pursue the even tenor of
    its life without feeling disasters which overtake other villages but a few
    miles off; but in the closely knit civilization to which we have attained,
    a war, a scarcity, a commercial crisis, in one hemisphere produces powerful
    effects in the other, while shocks and jars from which a primitive community
    easily recovers would to a highly civilized community mean wreck.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[10]</font> It is startling to think how destructive in
    a civilization like ours would be such fierce conflicts as fill the history
    of the past. The wars of highly civilized countries, since the opening of
    the era of steam and machinery, have been duels of armies rather than conflicts
    of peoples or classes. Our only glimpse of what might happen, wore passion
    fully aroused, was in the struggle of the Paris Commune. And, since 1870,
    to the knowledge of petroleum has been added that of even more destructive
    agents. The explosion of a little nitro-glycerin under a few water-mains
    would make a great city uninhabitable; the blowing up of a few railroad bridges
    and tunnels would bring famine quicker than the wall of circumvallation that
    Titus drew around Jerusalem; the pumping of atmospheric air into the gas-mains,
    and the application of a match, would tear up every street and level every
    house. The Thirty Years' War set back civilization in Germany; so fierce
    a war now would all but destroy it. Not merely have destructive powers vastly
    increased, but the whole social organization has become vastly more delicate.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[11]</font> In a simpler state master and man, neighbor
    and neighbor, know each other, and there is that touch of the elbow which,
    in times of danger, enables society to rally. But present tendencies are
    to the loss of this. In London, dwellers in one house do not know those in
    the next; the tenants of adjoining rooms are utter strangers to each other.
    Let civil conflict break or paralyze the authority that preserves order and
    the vast population would become a terror-stricken mob, without point of
    rally or principle of cohesion, and your London would be sacked and burned
    by an army of thieves. London is only the greatest of great cities. What
    is true of London is true of New York, and in the same measure true of the
    many cities whose hundreds of thousands are steadily growing toward millions.
    These vast aggregations of humanity, where he who seeks isolation may find
    it more truly than in the desert; where wealth and poverty touch and jostle;
    where one revels and another starves within a few feet of each other, yet
    separated by as great a gulf as that fixed between Dives in Hell and Lazarus
    in Abraham's bosom &#8212; they are centers and types of our civilization.
    Let jar or shock dislocate the complex and delicate organization, let the
    policeman's club be thrown down or wrested from him, and the fountains of
    the great deep are opened, and quicker than ever before chaos comes again.
    Strong as it may seem, our civilization is evolving destructive forces. Not
    desert and forest, but city slums and country roadsides are nursing the barbarians
    who may be to the new what Hun and Vandal were to the old.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Nor should we forget that in civilized man still
    lurks the savage. The men who, in past times, oppressed or revolted, who
    fought to the death in petty quarrels and drunk fury with blood, who burned
    cities and rent empires, were men essentially such as those we daily meet.
    Social progress has accumulated knowledge, softened manners, refined tastes
    and extended sympathies, but man is yet capable of as blind a rage as when,
    clothed in skins, he fought wild beasts with a flint. And present tendencies,
    in some respects at least, threaten to kindle passions that have so often
    before flamed in destructive fury.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[13]</font> There is in all the past nothing to compare
    with the rapid changes now going on in the civilized world. It seems as though
    in the European race, and in the nineteenth century, man was just beginning
    to live &#8212; just grasping his tools and becoming conscious of his powers.
    The snail's pace of crawling ages has suddenly become the headlong rush of
    the locomotive, speeding faster and faster. This rapid progress is primarily
    in industrial methods and material powers. But industrial changes imply social
    changes and necessitate political changes. Progressive societies outgrow
    institutions as children outgrow clothes. Social progress always requires
    greater intelligence in the management of public affairs; but this the more
    as progress is rapid and change quicker.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[14]</font> And that the rapid changes now going on are
    bringing up problems that demand most earnest attention may be seen on every
    hand. Symptoms of danger, premonitions of violence, are appearing all over
    the civilized world. Creeds are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces
    of conservatism are melting away. Political institutions are failing, as
    clearly in democratic America as in monarchical Europe. There is growing
    unrest and bitterness among the masses, whatever be the form of government,
    a blind groping for escape from conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute
    all this to the teachings of demagogues is like attributing the fever to
    the quickened pulse. It is the new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles.
    To put into a sailing-ship the powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer
    would be to tear her to pieces with their play. So the new powers rapidly
    changing all the relations of society must shatter social and political organizations
    not adapted to meet their strain.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[15] </font>To adjust our institutions to growing needs
    and changing conditions is the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism,
    human sympathy, and religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake
    it. There is danger in reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism.
    The problems beginning to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that there
    is fear they may not be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes. But
    their gravity comes from indisposition to recognize frankly and grapple boldly
    with them.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[16] </font>These dangers, which menace not one country
    alone, but modern civilization itself, do but show that a higher civilization
    is struggling to be born &#8212; that the needs and the aspirations of men
    have outgrown conditions and institutions that before sufficed.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[17]</font> A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth
    and power in the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human
    machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization
    is possible in which the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences
    now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless,
    and charitable societies unthought of. Such a civilization waits only for
    the social intelligence that will adapt means to ends. Powers that might
    give plenty to all are already in our hands. Though there is poverty and
    want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of wealth-producing
    forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say manufacturers, &quot;and we
    will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give us but work!&quot; cry idle
    men. <a href="../../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
      needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
      that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do
      things other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the
      blessings he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils
      that scourge us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that
      fills her breast with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health,
      so for society to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended
  for them is to breed social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.</p>
  <p><strong>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid
      wealth, the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize
      our civilization
    of today, are the natural, the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s
    beneficence, of our ignoring of his intent.</strong> Were we on the other hand to
    follow his clear, simple rule of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual
    all that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the value
    that attaches to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could
    evil modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all men would
    be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty of their
    Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert their labor and to enjoy
    its fruits. And then, without drastic or restrictive measures the forestalling
    of land would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security
    for the permanence of its use, and there would be no object for any one to
    get land or to keep land except for use; nor would his possession of better
    land than others had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation
    on them, since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the state
    for the benefit of all.</p>
