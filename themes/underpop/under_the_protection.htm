<blockquote>
  <p>Common wealth is like the dark matter of the economic universe &#8212; it&#8217;s
    everywhere, but we don&#8217;t see it. One reason we don&#8217;t see it is
    that much of it is, literally, invisible. Who can spot the air, an aquifer,
    or the social trust that underlies financial markets? The more relevant reason
    is our own blindness: the only economic matter we notice is the kind that
    glistens with dollar signs. We ignore common wealth because it lacks price
    tags and property rights.</p>
  <p>I first began to appreciate common wealth when Working Assets launched its
    socially screened money market fund. My job was to write advertisements that
    spurred people to send us large sums of money. Our promise was that we&#8217;d
    make this money grow, without investing in really bad companies, and send
    it back &#8212; including the growth, but minus our management fee &#8212; any
    time the investor requested. It struck me as quite remarkable that people
    who didn&#8217;t know us from a hole in the wall would send us substantial
    portions of their savings. Why, I wondered, did they trust us?</p>
  <p>The answer, of course, was that they didn&#8217;t trust us, they trusted
    <em>the system</em> in which we operated. They trusted that we&#8217;d prudently manage
    their savings not because we&#8217;d <em>personally</em> earned their confidence,
    but because they knew that if we didn&#8217;t, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission or some district attorney would bust us. Beyond that, they trusted
    that the corporations we invested in were honest in computing their incomes
    and reliable in meeting their obligations. That trust, and the larger system
    it&#8217;s based on, were built over generations, and we had nothing to do
    with it. In short, although Working Assets provided a service people willingly
    paid for, we also profited from a larger system we&#8217;d simply inherited.</p>
  <p>I got another whiff of common wealth when Working Assets considered going
    public &#8212; that is, selling stock to strangers through an initial public
    offering. Our investment banker informed us that, simply by going public,
    we&#8217;d increase the value of our stock by 30 percent. He called this
    magic a <em>liquidity premium</em>. What he meant was that stock that can be sold
    in a market of millions is worth more than stock that has almost no market
    at all. This extra value would come not from anything we did, but from the
    socially created bonus of liquidity. We&#8217;d be reaping what others sowed.
    (In the end, we didn&#8217;t go public because we didn&#8217;t want to be
    subjected to Wall Street&#8217;s calculus.)</p>
  <p>Trust and liquidity, I eventually realized, are just two small rivulets
    in an enormous river of common wealth that encompasses nature, community,
    and culture. Nature&#8217;s gifts are all those wondrous things, living and
    nonliving, that we inherit from the creation. Community includes the myriad
    threads, tangible and intangible, that connect us to other humans efficiently.
    Culture embodies our vast store of science, inventions, and art. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
    through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common property?
    One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted earlier, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to invest in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments pays yearly dividends
    to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended to any state or nation,
    whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent
    Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The
    reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of the
    population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</p>
  <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
  <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
    worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would pay
    equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell, so
    would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all boats.
    America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One can imagine a culture in which free concerts in parks, poets in schools
    and libraries, independent theaters and filmmakers, and murals and sculptures
    by local artists in public spaces thrive alongside corporate entertainment.
    There&#8217;s no lack of artists who&#8217;d participate in such a culture,
    or of nonartists who&#8217;d appreciate it. The problem is how to pay for
    it.</p>
  <p>What we need is a parallel economy for noncorporate art. Fortunately, models
    of such an economy exist. For example, there&#8217;s the San Francisco Grants
    for the Arts program, funded from a tax on hotel rooms. Since 1961, the program
    has distributed over $145 million to hundreds of nonprofit cultural organizations.
    It&#8217;s a prime reason the city pulses with free concerts, murals, film
    festivals, and theater in the park.</p>
  <p>Then there&#8217;s the Music Performance Trust Fund, set up in 1948. To
    settle a dispute with the musicians&#8217; union, the recording industry
    agreed to pay a small royalty from recording sales into a fund supporting
    live concerts in parks, schools, and other public venues. The fund was, and
    continues to be, administered by an independent trustee. In 2004 it sponsored
    over eleven thousand free concerts throughout the United States and Canada.
    Thanks to this system, sales of corporate-owned music support the living
    culture on which the recording industry ultimately depends.</p>
  <p>These models could be scaled up. As a revenue source, consider what companies
    like Disney get with their copyrights. They get ninety-five-year protection
    for their movies, they get those FBI warnings on our DVDs, they get the U.S.
    government extending intellectual property rights worldwide, and they get
    police busting street vendors for selling &#8220;pirated&#8221; DVDs. That
    kind of protection is worth big bucks. Yet the companies&#8217; price tag
    for it is exactly zero. (They do pay taxes, but so does everybody else.)</p>
  <p><strong>What if, instead of supplying copyright protection for free, we
      charged a royalty on sales of electronically reproduced music, films, and
      video games?
    This could be supplemented by charging broadcasters for their exclusive licenses,
    and advertisers for their invasions of our brains </strong>(see the following section).
    The resulting billions could be distributed, through a National Arts Trust,
    to local arts councils, which in turn would support community arts institutions
    and artists. Under this system, corporations would give back to a commons
    they now take from for free. More art would be live and local, and more artists
    would be employed. We&#8217;d have corporate and authentic culture at the
    same time. ...</p>
  <p>The airwaves, also known as the broadcast spectrum, are a gift of nature
    that modern technology has turned into a valuable resource. As a medium for
    sharing information and ideas, airwaves have enormous advantages over paper
    and wires. The problem in the early days was that signals often interfered
    with one another. If two nearby transmitters used the same or adjacent frequencies,
    a radio listener would hear two sound streams simultaneously. America&#8217;s
    approach to this problem (though not Britain&#8217;s or Canada&#8217;s) was
    to give free exclusive local frequencies to private broadcasters, subject
    to periodic hearings and renewal.</p>
  <p>The quid pro quo for this gift, according to the Communications Act of 1934,
    was that broadcasters would serve &#8220;the public interest, convenience,
    and necessity&#8221; &#8212; whatever that might mean. The airwaves themselves
    would remain, in theory, public property, with the Federal Communications
    Commission (again in theory) acting as trustee. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 9: Building the Commons Sector (pages 135-154)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some commons trusts will generate income from the sale of usage permits.
    Many others will need income to acquire property rights, restore degraded
    habitat, or give children start-up capital. It&#8217;s therefore essential
    to encourage a multiplicity of revenue sources. The best way to do this is
    through a federal commons tax credit.</p>
  <p>When I was in the solar energy business during the 1970s, our customers
    benefited from a combination of federal and state solar tax credits. As I
    frequently explained then, a tax credit isn&#8217;t the same as a tax deduction &#8212; it&#8217;s
    bigger. A deduction is subtracted from the amount of income subject to tax;
    if your marginal tax rate is 30 percent, a tax deduction saves you thirty
    cents on the dollar. By contrast, a tax credit is subtracted from the amount
    of taxes you pay, regardless of your tax bracket. If you owe taxes, it always
    saves you one hundred cents on the dollar.</p>
  <p>The premise behind a commons tax credit is that wealthy Americans owe more
    to the commons than they currently pay to the government in taxes. That being
    so, a commons tax credit would work like this. The federal government would
    raise the uppermost tax bracket by a few percentage points. At the same time,
    it would give affected taxpayers a choice: pay the extra money to the government,
    or contribute it to one or more qualified commons trusts. If people do the
    latter, they get a 100 percent tax credit, thereby avoiding additional taxes.
    The message to the wealthy thus is: You have to give back more. Whether you
    give it to the IRS or directly to the commons is up to you. If you want to
    eliminate the government middleman, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
  <p>What qualifies as a commons trust? It&#8217;s a trust that either benefits
    all citizens more or less equally or collects money to restore an endangered
    commons. Social Security, the American Permanent Fund, the Children&#8217;s
    Opportunity Trust, and most land and watershed trusts, would qualify. By
    contrast, a normal charity would not.</p>
  <p>Contributions to normal charities would remain deductible from taxable income,
    but not from taxes owed. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
