<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to working-men&#8217;s associations, what your Holiness seems to contemplate
    is the formation and encouragement of societies akin to the Catholic sodalities,
    and to the friendly and beneficial societies, like the Odd Fellows, which
    have had a large extension in English-speaking countries. Such associations
    may promote fraternity, extend social intercourse and provide assurance in
    case of sickness or death, but if they go no further they are powerless to
    affect wages even among their members. As to trades-unions proper, it is
    hard to define your position, which is, perhaps, best stated as one of warm
    approbation provided that they do not go too far. For while you object to
    strikes; while you reprehend societies that &#8220;do their best to get into
    their hands the whole field of labor and to force working-men either to join
    them or to starve;&#8221; while you discountenance the coercing of employers
    and seem to think that arbitration might take the place of strikes; yet you
    use expressions and assert principles that are all that the trades-unionist
    would ask, not merely to justify the strike and the boycott, but even the
    use of violence where only violence would suffice. For you speak of the insufficient
    wages of workmen as due to the greed of rich employers; you assume the moral
    right of the workman to obtain employment from others at wages greater than
    those others are willing freely to give; and you deny the right of any one
    to work for such wages as he pleases, in such a way as to lead Mr. Stead,
    in so widely read a journal as the Review of Reviews, approvingly to declare
    that you regard &#8220;<strong>blacklegging</strong>,&#8221; i.e., the working for less than
    union wages, as a crime.</p>
  <p>To men conscious of bitter injustice, to men steeped in poverty yet mocked
    by flaunting wealth, such words mean more than I can think you realize.</p>
  <p>When fire shall be cool and ice be warm, when armies shall throw away lead
    and iron, to try conclusions by the pelting of rose-leaves, such labor associations
    as you are thinking of may be possible. But not till then. For labor associations
    can do nothing to raise wages but by force. It may be force applied passively,
    or force applied actively, or force held in reserve, but it must be force.
    They must coerce or hold the power to coerce employers; they must coerce
    those among their own members disposed to straggle; they must do their best
    to get into their hands the whole field of labor they seek to occupy and
    to force other working-men either to join them or to starve. Those who tell
    you of trades-unions bent on raising wages by moral suasion alone are like
    those who would tell you of tigers that live on oranges.</p>
  <p>The condition of the masses today is that of men pressed together in a hall
    where ingress is open and more are constantly coming, but where the doors
    for egress are closed. If forbidden to relieve the general pressure by throwing
    open those doors, whose bars and bolts are private property in land, they
    can only mitigate the pressure on themselves by forcing back others, and
    the weakest must be driven to the wall. This is the way of labor-unions and
    trade-guilds. Even those amiable societies that you recommend would in their
    efforts to find employment for their own members necessarily displace others.</p>
  <p>For even the philanthropy which, recognizing the evil of trying to help
    labor by alms, seeks to help men to help themselves by finding them work,
    becomes aggressive in the blind and bitter struggle that private property
    in land entails, and in helping one set of men injures others. Thus, to minimize
    the bitter complaints of taking work from others and lessening the wages
    of others in providing their own beneficiaries with work and wages, benevolent
    societies are forced to devices akin to the digging of holes and filling
    them up again. Our American societies feel this difficulty, General Booth
    encounters it in England, and the Catholic societies which your Holiness
    recommends must find it, when they are formed.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness knows of, and I am sure honors, the princely generosity of
    Baron Hirsch toward his suffering coreligionists. But, as I write, the New
    York newspapers contain accounts of an immense meeting held in Cooper Union,
    in this city, on the evening of Friday, September 4, in which a number of
    Hebrew trades-unions protested in the strongest manner against the loss of
    work and reduction of wages that are being effected by Baron Hirsch&#8217;s
    generosity in bringing their own countrymen here and teaching them to work.
    The resolution unanimously adopted at this great meeting thus concludes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We now demand of Baron Hirsch himself that he release us from his &#8220;charity&#8221; and
        take back the millions, which, instead of a blessing, have proved a curse
        and a source of misery.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nor does this show that the members of these Hebrew labor-unions &#8212; who
    are themselves immigrants of the same class as those Baron Hirsch is striving
    to help, for in the next generation they lose with us their distinctiveness &#8212; are
    a whit less generous than other men.</p>
  <p>Labor associations of the nature of trade-guilds or unions are necessarily
    selfish; by the law of their being they must fight for their own hand, regardless
    of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore the teaching of Christ that we
    should do to others as we would have them do to us, which a true political
    economy shows is the only way to the full emancipation of the masses. <strong>They
    must do their best to starve workmen who do not join them, they must by all
    means in their power force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8212; as the
    soldier in battle must shoot down his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing
    ranks. And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8212; a
    fellow-creature in all probability more pressed and starved than those who
    so bitterly denounce him, and often with the hungry pleading faces of wife
    and child behind him.</strong></p>
  <p>And, in so far as they succeed, what is it that trade-guilds and unions
    do but to impose more restrictions on natural rights; to create &#8220;trusts&#8221; in
    labor; to add to privileged classes other somewhat privileged classes; and
    to press the weaker closer to the wall?</p>
  <p>I speak without prejudice against trades-unions, of which for years I was
    an active member. And in pointing out to your Holiness that their principle
    is selfish and incapable of large and permanent benefits, and that their
    methods violate natural rights and work hardship and injustice, I am only
    saying to you what, both in my books and by word of mouth, I have said over
    and over again to them. Nor is what I say capable of dispute. Intelligent
    trades-unionists know it, and the less intelligent vaguely feel it. And even
    those of the classes of wealth and leisure who, as if to head off the demand
    for natural rights, are preaching trades-unionism to working-men, must needs
    admit it.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness will remember the great London dock strike of two years ago,
    which, with that of other influential men, received the moral support of
    that Prince of the Church whom we of the English speech hold higher and dearer
    than any prelate has been held by us since the blood of Thomas &agrave; Becket
    stained the Canterbury altar.</p>
  <p>In a volume called &#8220;<em>The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike,</em>&#8221; written
    by Messrs. H. Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
    Buxton, M.P., which advocates trades-unionism as the solution of the labor
    question, and of which a large number were sent to Australia as a sort of
    official recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers,
    I find in the summing up, on pages 164-165, the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more
                            regular, better paid, and carried on under better
                        conditions than
                              ever before. All this will be an unqualified gain
                        to those who get the
                                benefit
                                  from
                                  it.
                                    But another
                                        result will undoubtedly be to contract
                        the field of employment and lessen the number of those
                        for
                          whom work
                            can be
                              found. The
                                lower-class casual
                                      will,
                                        in the end, find his position more precarious
                            than ever before, in
                                    proportion to the increased regularity of
                        work which the &#8220;fitter&#8221; of the
                                        laborers will secure. The effect of the organization of dock labor, as of
                                        all classes of labor, will be to squeeze out the residuum. The loafer, the
                                        cadger, the failure in the industrial race &#8212; the members of &#8220;Class
                                        B&#8221; of Mr. Charles Booth&#8217;s hierarchy of social classes &#8212; will
                                        be no gainers by the change, but will
                                        rather find another door closed against
                                        them, and
                                        this in many
                                        cases the
                                        last door to
                                        employment.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I am far from wishing that your Holiness should join in that pharisaical
    denunciation of trades-unions common among those who, while quick to point
    out the injustice of trades-unions in denying to others the equal right to
    work, are themselves supporters of that more primary injustice that denies
    the equal right to the standing-place and natural material necessary to work.
    What I wish to point out is that trades-unionism, while it may be a partial
    palliative, is not a remedy; that it has not that moral character which could
    alone justify one in the position of your Holiness in urging it as good in
    itself. Yet, so long as you insist on private property in land what better
    can you do? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>
