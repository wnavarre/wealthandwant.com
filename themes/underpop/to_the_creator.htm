  Labor
</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Being created individuals, with individual
    wants and powers, men are individually entitled (subject of course to the
    moral obligations that arise from such relations as that of the family) to
    the use of their own powers and the enjoyment of the results.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its validity
  from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced by labor &#8211; a
  right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to deprive him without
  his will is theft.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to
  himself, is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things
  produced by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean, he acquires a right of
      property in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or
      gift. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so
      that he may sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</small></li>
  <li><small>Or, if he set up a windmill, he acquires a right of property in
      the things such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim
      a right of property in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid
      others to use it.</small></li>
  <li><small>Or, if he cultivate grain, he acquires a right of property in the
      grain his labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property
      in the sun which ripened it or the soil in which it grew.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For these things are of the continuing gifts
    of God to all generations of men, which all may use, but none may claim as
    his alone.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To attach to things created by God the same
    right of private ownership that justly attaches to things produced by labor
    is to impair and deny the true rights of property. For a man who out of the
    proceeds of his labor is obliged to pay another man far the use of ocean
    or air or sunshine or soil &#8211; all of which are involved in the single
    term &#8220;land&#8221; &#8211; is in this deprived of his rightful property;
    and thus robbed....&nbsp;<a href="../HG/WoL.htm"> <span
