  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
  <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
    are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium of
    forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation to
        users and <br>
                2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                  is really the socially created value. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
    investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
    and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
    to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing the land
    rent proximate to the highway corridors. <strong>This is socially created value,
    which is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than
    allowing
    it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property close by.</strong> User
    fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
    as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
    with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
    ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
    charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
    accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
    and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
    use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
  <p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
    and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with
    the costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom,
    it
    is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
    level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be
    linked to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption,
    to the
    full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental
    ambiences. Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing
    design for
    highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
    The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
    average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of
    $68 billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent
    136 hours
    stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
    times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes
    one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New
    York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But
    not all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
    time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people to
    impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored
    in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway space.
    In a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a form of
    land
    rent. ... <a href="../../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Rent in Cities</strong></p>
  <p>The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the economic
    rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes to settle
    on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market price of
    sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced ground rent
    in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect on sites but could
    be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the services that cities are
    bound to perform. As will be evident below, the amount of economic rent available
    for recovery is thought sufficient to pay for all services and then some. Today
    it simply collects on sites of greatest activity with typical and visible negative
    consequences. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>
