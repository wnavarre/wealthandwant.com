<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">In Liverpool: The Financial
    Reform Meeting at the Liverpool Rotunda </a>(1889)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You are right, Mr. Garrison. The true republic, the American Republic that
    we hope for and pray is not yet here. (Hear, hear) A poor thing is a republic
    where the tramp jostles the millionaire, where liberty is mocked by a paternal
    system of interference with human rights, where, under the pretext of protecting
    labor, labor is robbed! (Cheers) And here, in the motherland, in the United
    States, in Australia and New Zealand, we of the English tongue find the same
    difficulties confronting us. Liberty is not yet here; but, thank God, she
    is coming. (Cheers) Not merely the American Republic, not merely the Republic
    of the Southern Cross, not merely the Republic of Great Britain and Ireland
    is it that we see in the future, but that great republic that some day is
    to
    confederate the English speaking people everywhere (loud cheers) that is
    to bring a grander &quot;Roman peace&quot; to the world. (A voice: More than that.)
    Aye, more than that &#8212; that is to bring civilization as much higher,
    as much better than what we call a Christian civilization, as this is higher
    and
    better than barbarism. And already, in meetings such as this, it seems to
    me that I feel an earnest [presentiment] of the coming time when we of one
    blood
    and one speech are also to be one. (Cheers) For the same principles, for
    the same great cause that we stand in the United States we stand here. And
    in a
    little over a week from now I will be standing on an American platform speaking
    to men whose hearts are beating in the same cause in which we are engaged
    here. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>Our little local politics may differ; our greater politics are one and the
    same. We have the same evils to redress, the same truth to propagate, the same
    end to seek.</p>
  <p>And that end, what is it but liberty? (Hear, hear) He who listens to the voice
    of Freedom, she will lead and lead him on. Before I was born, before our friend
    there was born, there was in a southern city of the United States a young printer
    bearing the name William Lloyd Garrison. (Cheers) He saw around him the iniquity
    of negro slavery. (Hear, hear) The voice of the oppressed cried to him and
    would not let him rest, and he took up the cross. He became the great apostle
    of human liberty, and today in American cities that once hooted and stoned
    him there are now statues raised to William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
  <p>He began as a protectionist. As he moved on he saw that liberty meant something
    more than simply the abolition of chattel slavery. He saw that liberty also
    meant, not merely the right to freely labor for oneself, but the right to freely
    exchange one's production, and, from a protectionist, William Lloyd Garrison
    became a free trader. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>And now, when the first is gone, the second comes forward, to take one further
    step to realize that for perfect freedom there must also be freedom in the
    use of natural opportunities. (Hear, hear, and cheers)</p>
  <p>We have come . . . to the same point by converging lines. Why is freedom
    of trade good? Simply that trade &#8212; exchange &#8212; is but a mode of production.
    Therefore, to secure full free trade we must also secure freedom to the natural
    opportunities of production. (Hear, hear) Our production&#8212;what is it?
    We produce from what? From land. All human production consists but in working
    up the raw materials that we find in nature &#8212; consists simply in changing
    in place, or in form, that matter which we call land. To free production there
    must be no monopoly of the natural element. Even in our methods we agree primarily
    on this essential point &#8212; that everyone ought to be free to exert his
    labor, to retain or to exchange its fruits, unhampered by restrictions, unvexed
    by the tax gatherer. (Hear, hear) . . .</p>
  <p>Chattel slavery, thank God, is abolished at last. Nowhere, where the American
    flag flies, can one man be bought, or sold, or held by another. (Cheers) But
    a great struggle still lies before us now. Chattel slavery is gone; industrial
    slavery remains. The effort, the aim of the abolitionists of this time is to
    abolish industrial slavery. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>The free trade movement in England was a necessary step in this direction.
    The men who took part in it did more than they knew. Striking at restrictions
    in the form of protection, aiming at emancipating trade by reducing tariffs
    to a minimum for revenue only, they aroused a spirit that yet goes further.
    There sits, in the person of my friend, Mr. Briggs [Thomas Briggs], one of
    the men of that time, one of the men who, not stopping, has always aimed
    a a larger freedom, one of the men who today hails what we in the United
    States
    call the single tax movement, as the natural outcome and successor of the
    movement which Richard Cobden led.39 (A voice: &quot;Three cheers for Mr. Briggs,&quot; and
    cheers)</p>
  <p>And here, in your Financial Reform Association, you have the society that
    has best preserved the best spirit of that time, that has never cried &quot;Hold!&quot; [and]
    that has always striven to move forward to a fuller and a brighter day. (Hear,
    hear)</p>
  <p>In the United States, carried away by the heat of the great struggle, we
    allowed protection to build itself up. We have to now make the fight that
    you have
    partially won over here; but, in making that fight, we make the fight for
    full and absolute free trade. I don't believe that protection can ever be
    abolished
    in the United States until a majority of the people have been brought to
    see the absurdity and the wickedness of all tariffs, whether protective or
    for
    revenue only (hear, hear); have been brought to realize the deep truth of
    the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; have been led to see what
    Mr.
    Garrison has so eloquently said, that the interests of mankind are harmonious,
    not antagonistic, that one nation cannot profit at the expense of another,
    but that every people is benefited by the advance of other peoples &#8212; (cheers) &#8212; until
    we shall aim at a free trade that will enable the citizen of England to enter
    the ports of the United States as freely as today, the citizen of Massachusetts
  crosses into New York. (Cheers) ... <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> LET us try to trace the genesis of civilization. Gifted alone with
  the power of relating cause and effect, man is among all animals the only producer
  in the true sense of the term. . . . But the same quality of reason which makes
  him the producer, also, wherever exchange becomes possible, makes him the exchanger.
  And it is along this line of exchanging that the body economic is evolved and
  develops, and that all the advances of civilization are primarily made. . .
  . With the beginning of exchange or trade among men this body economic begins
  to form, and in its beginning civilization begins. . . . To find an utterly
  uncivilized people, we must find a people among whom there is no exchange or
  trade. Such a people does not exist, and, as far as our knowledge goes, never
  did. To find a fully civilized people, we must find a people among whom exchange
  or trade is absolutely free, and has reached the fullest development to which
  human desires can carry it. There is, as yet, unfortunately, no such people. &#8212; <em>The
  Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe105.html">unabridged:
  Book I, Chapter 5, The Meaning of Political Economy: The Origin and Genesis
  of Civilization</a> &#8226; <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speI_4.htm">abridged:
  Chapter 4, The Origin and Genesis of Civilization</a><br>
          <br>
          <br>
WHEN we, come to analyze production, we find it to fall into three modes, viz:: <br>
ADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so as to fit
them for the satisfaction of human desire. <br>
GROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising vegetables or
animals. <br>
EXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth, the higher
powers of those natural forces which vary with locality, or of those human forces
which vary with situation, occupation, or character. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html"> &#8212; Book
III, Chapter 3, The Laws of Distribution: of Interest and the Cause of Interest</a><br>
          <br>
THESE modes seem to appear and to assume importance, in the development of human
society, much in the order here given. They originate from the increase of the
desires of men with the increase of the means of satisfying them, under pressure
of the fundamental law of political economy, that men seek to satisfy their desires
with the least exertion. In the primitive stage of human life the readiest way
of satisfying desires is by adapting to human use what is found in existence.
In a later and more settled stage it is discovered that certain desires can be
more easily and more fully satisfied by utilizing the principle of growth and
reproduction, as by cultivating vegetables and breeding animals. And in a still
later period of development, it becomes obvious that certain desires can be better
and more easily satisfied by exchange, which brings out the principle of co-operation
more fully and powerfully than could obtain among unexchanging economic units. &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe302.html">unabridged:
Book III, Chapter 2, The Production of Wealth: The Three Modes of Production</a> &#8226;<a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_2.htm"> abridged:

  <p>"COME with me," said Richard Cobden, as John Bright turned heart-stricken
    from a new-made grave. "There are in England women and children dying with
    hunger &#8212; with hunger made by the laws. Come with me, and we will not
    rest until we repeal those laws." <br>
            <br>
In this spirit the free trade movement waxed and grew, arousing an enthusiasm
that no mere fiscal reform could have aroused. And intrenched though it was by
restricted suffrage and rotten boroughs and aristocratic privilege, protection
was overthrown in Great Britain. <br>
            <br>
And &#8212; there is hunger in Great Britain still, and women and children yet
die of it. <br>
            <br>
But this is not the failure of free trade. When protection had been abolished
and a revenue tariff substituted for a protective tariff, free trade had only
won an outpost. That women and children still die of hunger in Great Britain
arises from the failure of the reformers to go on. Free trade has not yet been
tried in Great Britain. Free trade in its fulness and entirety would indeed abolish
hunger. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 26: True Free
