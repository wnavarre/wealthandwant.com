<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Think, for example, about carbon. At present, our economic engine is emitting
    far too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; this is destabilizing the
    climate. We desperately need a valve that can crank the carbon flow down.
    Let&#8217;s assume we can design and install such a valve. (I explained how
    this can be done in my previous book, Who Owns the Sky? It involves selling
    a limited quantity of &#8220;upstream&#8221; permits to companies that bring
    fossil fuels into the economy.) The question then is, who should control
    the valve?</p>
  <p>Unfettered markets can&#8217;t be given that responsibility; as we&#8217;ve
    seen, they have no ability to limit polluting. So we&#8217;re left with two
    options: government or trusts. Government is a political creature; its time
    horizon is short, and future generations have no clout in it. Common property
    trusts, by contrast, are fiduciary institutions. They have long time horizons
    and a legal responsibility to future generations. Given the choice, I&#8217;d
    designate a common property trust to be keeper of the carbon valve, based
    on peer-reviewed advice from scientists. Its trustees could make hard decisions
    without committing political suicide. They might be appointed by the president,
    like governors of the Fed, but they wouldn&#8217;t be obedient to him the
    way cabinet members are. Once appointed, they&#8217;d be legally accountable
    to future generations.</p>
  <p>Now imagine a goodly number of valves at the local, regional, and national
    levels, not just for carbon (which requires only one national valve) but
    for a variety of pollutants. Imagine also that the valve keepers are trusts
    accountable to future generations. They&#8217;d have the power to reduce
    some of the negative externalities &#8212; the illth &#8212; that corporations
    shift to the commons. They&#8217;d also have the power to auction limited
    pollution rights to the highest bidders, and to divide the resulting income
    among commons owners. That&#8217;s something neither the Fed nor the EPA
    can do.</p>
  <p>These trusts would fundamentally change our economic operating system. What
    are now unpriced externalities would become property rights under accountable
    management. If a corporation wanted to pollute, it couldn&#8217;t just do
    so; it would have to buy the rights from a commons trust. The price of pollution
    would go up; corporate illth creation would go down. Ecosystems would be
    protected for future generations. More income would flow to ordinary citizens.
    Nonhuman species would flourish; human inequality would diminish. And government
    wouldn&#8217;t be enlarged &#8212; our economic engine would do these things
    on its own.</p>
  <p>One final point about valves. It&#8217;s not too critical where we set them
    initially. It&#8217;s far more important to install them in the right places,
    and to put the right people in charge. Then they can adjust the settings.
    ...</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let us suppose,&#8221; economist Ronald Coase wrote in 1960, &#8220;that
    a farmer and a cattle-raiser are operating on neighboring properties.&#8221; He
    went on to suppose further that the cattle-raiser&#8217;s animals wander
    onto the farmer&#8217;s land and damage his crops. From this hypothetical
    starting point Coase examined the problem of externalities and proposed a
    solution &#8212; the creation of rights to pollute or not be polluted upon.
    Today, pollution rights are used throughout the world. In effect, Coase conjured
    into existence a class of property rights that didn&#8217;t exist before,
    and his leap of imagination eventually reduced real pollution.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let us suppose&#8221; is a wonderful way for anyone, economists included,
    to begin thinking. It lets us adjust old assumptions and see what might happen.
    And it lets us imagine things that don&#8217;t exist but could, and sometimes,
    because we imagined them, later do.</p>
  <p>Coase supposed that a single polluter or his neighboring pollutee possessed
    a right to pollute or not be polluted upon. He further supposed that the
    transaction costs involved in negotiations between the two neighbors were
    negligible. He made these suppositions half a century ago, at a time when
    aggregate pollution wasn&#8217;t planet-threatening, as it now is. Given
    today&#8217;s altered reality, it might be worth updating Coase&#8217;s suppositions
    to make them relevant to this aggregate problem. Here, in my mind, are the
    appropriate new suppositions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Instead of one polluter, there are many, and instead of one pollutee,
            there are millions &#8212; including many not yet born.</li>
    <li> The pollutees (including future generations) are collectively represented
            by trusts.</li>
    <li> The initial pollution rights are assigned by government to these
        trusts.</li>
    <li> In deciding how many pollution permits to sell, the trustees&#8217; duty
              isn&#8217;t to maximize revenue but to preserve an ecosystem for
              future generations. The trusts therefore establish safe levels
              of pollution and
              gradually reduce
              the number of permits they sell until those levels are reached.</li>
    <li> Revenue from the sale of pollution permits is divided 50 percent
                  for per capita dividends (like the Alaska Permanent Fund) and
      50 percent for public
                  goods such as education and ecological restoration.</li>
  </ul>
      <p>If we make these suppositions, what then happens? We have, first of all,
          an economic model with a second set of books. Not all, but many externalities
          show up on these new ledgers. More importantly, we begin to imagine a world
          in which nature and future generations are represented in real-time transactions,
          corporations internalize previously externalized costs, prices of illth-causing
        goods rise, and everyone receives some property income.</p>
      <p>Here&#8217;s what such a world could look like:</p>
      <ul>
          <li> Degradation of key ecosystems is gradually reduced to sustainable
            levels because the trustees who set commons usage levels are accountable
            to
          future generations, not living shareholders or voters. When they fail
            to protect
            their beneficiaries, they are sued.</li>
          <li> Thanks to per capita dividends, income is recycled from overusers
            of key ecosystems to underusers, creating both incentives to conserve
            and
              greater
              equity.</li>
          <li> Clean energy and organic farming are competitive because prices
          of fossil fuels and agricultural chemicals are appropriately high.</li>
          <li> Investment in new technologies soars and new domestic jobs are
                    created because higher fuel and waste disposal prices boost
            demand for clean
                    energy and waste
              recycling systems.</li>
          <li> Public goods are enhanced by permit revenue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What has happened here? We&#8217;ve gone from a realistic set of assumptions
          about how the world is &#8212; multiple polluters and pollutees, zero cost
          of pollution, dangerous cumulative levels of pollution &#8212; to a reasonable
          set of expectations about how the world could be if certain kinds of property
          rights are introduced. These property rights go beyond Coase&#8217;s, but
          are entirely compatible with market principles. The results of this thought
          experiment show that the introduction of common property trusts can produce
          a significant and long-lasting shift in economic outcomes without further
        government intervention. ...</p>
      <p>Commons Rent</p>
      <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be, a money-free
          zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and the rest of us) to
        understand is commons rent.</p>
      <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord. In
          economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid because
          of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound puzzling, but
          consider this. A city has available a million apartments. In absolute terms,
          that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But the city is confined geographically
          and demand for apartments is intense. In this economic sense, apartments
          are scarce. Now think back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage
          you pay the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
          or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
          is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San Franciscans
          write such large checks to landlords and banks, while people in Nebraska
        don&#8217;t.</p>
      <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply. Rent
          due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can (and should)
          debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself arises automatically.
          And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because this helps the larger economy
          allocate scarce resources efficiently. Other methods of allocation are possible.
          We can distribute scarce things on a first come, first served basis, or by
          lottery, political power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though,
          that selling scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach,
        and such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
      <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam Smith, David
          Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because it constituted
          most of the money earned by landowners, and land was then a major cost of
          production. The supply of land, these economists noted, is limited, but demand
          for it steadily increases. So, therefore, does its rent. Thus, landowners
          benefit from what Mill called the unearned increment &#8212; the rise in
          land value attributable not to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially
        created increase in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
      <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further. Seeing
          both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked a logical question:
          Why does poverty persist despite economic growth? The answer, he believed,
          was the appropriation of rent by landowners. Even as the economy grew, the
          property rights system and the scarcity of land diverted almost all the gains
          to a landowning minority. Whereas competition limited the gains of working
          people, nothing kept down the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted,
          the value of their land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated
          a steep tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
          Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
        economists never took him seriously.</p>
      <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in rent;
          it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to capital and labor.
          But the twenty-first century ecological crisis brings rent back to center-stage.
          Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s scarce, but clean water, undisturbed
        habitat, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
      <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and allocation
          of property rights are the primary factors in determining who pays whom for
          what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution rights are given free
          to past polluters, the rent from the polluted ecosystem will also go to them.
          That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden products will rise as pollution
          is limited (remember, if demand is constant, a reduction in supply causes
          prices to go up), and those higher prices will flow to producers (which is
        to say, polluters).</p>
      <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
          and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
          the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If the
          trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures on
        public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
      <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting corporations
          are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts getting the
          rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers will pay commons
          rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves as beneficiaries
          of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will be the same, but his
          payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden products. The more
          he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back
          less than they put in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic
        incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
      <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
                incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s
                interest to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent
                for scarce things
                works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re
                a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake of argument)
                your responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations,
                you want to
                increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits
                you sell, or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is:
                you lower
                the number
            of permits. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
    through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common property?
    One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted earlier, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to invest in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments pays yearly dividends
    to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended to any state or nation,
    whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent
    Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The
    reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of the
    population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</p>
  <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
  <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
    worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would pay
    equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell, so
    would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all boats.
    America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
