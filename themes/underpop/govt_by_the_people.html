      <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political
    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em></strong>,
1883)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
          of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies<strong> the loss
          by the people of governmental control</strong>. Democratic forms may be maintained,
          but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
          any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
          misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
          continued to abhor
          the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
          at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
          more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
          political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
          in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
          day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
          what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
          government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
          something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
          free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
          their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
          The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
          the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
          suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
          see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
          without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
          vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
          How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
          of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
          bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
          tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
          I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
          to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government.</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize, and they listen to quacks
  who propose to cure the symptoms without touching the disease. &quot;Let us
  elect good men to office,&quot; say the quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds
  by sprinkling salt on their tails!</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[13]</font> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of popular government
          in the United States is clearly a failure. Not that it is a failure everywhere
          and in everything. An experiment of this kind does not have to be fully worked
          out to be proved a failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from
          the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our government
          by the people has in large degree become, is in larger degree becoming, government
          by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
  of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
  it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
  earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
  to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
  gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
  is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
  the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
  competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
  their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
  in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
  a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
  the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
  doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
  time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
  chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
  due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
  in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred.</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[16]</font> As for the great railroad managers, they may well say, &quot;The people
          be d--d!&quot; When they want the power of the people they buy the people's
          masters. The map of the United States is colored to show States and Territories.
          A map of real political powers would ignore State lines. Here would be a big
          patch representing the domains of Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would
          be brightly marked. In another place would be set off the empire of Stanford
          and Huntington; in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and
          parts of States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be distinguished
          from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on. In our National Senate,
          sovereign members of the Union are supposed to be represented; but what are
          more truly represented are railroad kings and great moneyed interests, though
          occasionally a jobber from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling
          powers, is suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well
          as the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king makes
          his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to make his chaplain
          a bishop.</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[17] </font>We do not get even cheap government. We might keep a royal family, house
          them in palaces like Versailles or Sans Souci, provide them with courts and
          guards, masters of robes and rangers of parks, let them give balls more costly
          than Mrs. Vanderbilt's, and build yachts finer than Jay Gould's, for much less
          than is wasted and stolen under our nominal government of the people. What
          a noble income would be that of a Duke of New York, a Marquis of Philadelphia,
          or a Count of San Francisco, who would administer the government of these municipalities
          for fifty per cent. of present waste and stealage! Unless we got an esthetic
          Chinook, where could we get an absolute ruler who would erect such a monument
          of extravagant vulgarity as the new Capitol of the State of New York? While,
          as we saw in the Congress just adjourned, the benevolent gentlemen whose desire
          it is to protect us against the pauper labor of Europe quarrel over their respective
          shares of the spoil with as little regard for the taxpayer as a pirate crew
          would have for the consignees of a captured vessel.</p>
        <p><font size="-2">[19]</font> All this shows want of grasp and timidity of thought. It is not by accident
          that government grows corrupt and passes out of the hands of the people. If
          we would really make and continue this a government of the people, for the
          people and by the people, we must give to our politics earnest attention; we
          must be prepared to review our opinions, to give up old ideas and to accept
          new ones. We must abandon prejudice, and make our reckoning with free minds.
          The sailor, who, no matter how the wind might change, should persist in keeping
          his vessel under the same sail and on the same tack, would never reach his
        haven. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
