<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
  A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
    A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
    A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
      the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
      without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
      with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
    A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
      of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
      is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
      <strong>Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power,
      an unpaid-for and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding
      generations. </strong>      Capital is paid for and ephemeral. <strong>Privilege
      is unpaid for and eternal.</strong> A
      man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
      in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
      instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
      that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
    A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
      or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
    A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
      and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
      or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
      prices to the consumer.</p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
      A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is
      a burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their
      tenants;
    most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
    thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
    A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
      privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one
      proper channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain. ... <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 5: Reinventing the Commons (pages 65-78)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thus far I&#8217;ve argued that Capitalism 2.0 &#8212; or surplus capitalism &#8212; has
    three tragic flaws: it devours nature, widens inequality, and fails to make
    us happier in the end. It behaves this way because it&#8217;s programmed
    to do so. It <strong>must</strong> make thneeds, reward property owners disproportionately,
    and distract us from truer paths to happiness because its algorithms direct
    it to do so. Neither enlightened managers nor the occasional zealous regulator
    can make it behave much differently.</p>
  <p>In this part of the book I advance a solution. The essence of it is
          to fix capitalism&#8217;s operating system by adding a commons sector
          to balance the corporate sector. The new sector would supply virtuous
          feedback loops
              and proxies for unrepresented stakeholders: future generations,
          pollutees, and nonhuman species. And would offset the corporate sector&#8217;s <em>negative</em> externalities
              with <em>positive</em> externalities of comparable magnitude. If
              the corporate sector devours nature, the commons sector would protect
              it. If the corporate
              sector widens inequality, the commons sector would reduce it. If
              the corporate sector turns us into self-obsessed consumers, the
              commons sector would reconnect
              us to nature, community, and culture. All this would happen automatically
              once the commons sector is set up. The result would be a balanced
              economy that gives us the best of both sectors and the worst of
        neither. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Organizing Principles of the Commons Sector</strong></p>
  <p>Property rights, especially the common kind, require competent institutions
    to manage them. What we need today, then, along with more common property,
    is a set of institutions, distinct from corporations and government, whose
    unique and explicit mission is to manage common property.</p>
  <p>I say set of institutions because there will and should be variety. The
    commons sector should not be a monoculture like the corporate sector. Each
    institution should be appropriate to its particular asset and locale.</p>
  <p>Some of the variety will depend on whether the underlying asset is limited
    or inexhaustible. Typically, gifts of nature have limited capacities; the
    air can safely absorb only so much carbon dioxide, the oceans only so many
    drift nets. Institutions that manage natural assets must therefore be capable
    of limiting use. By contrast, ideas and cultural creations have endless potential
    for elaboration and reuse. In these commons, managing institutions should
    maximize public access and minimize private tollbooths.</p>
  <p>Despite their variations, commons sector institutions would share a set
    of organizing principles. Here are the main ones.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">LEAVE ENOUGH AND AS GOOD IN COMMON</font></strong></p>
  <p>As Locke argued, it&#8217;s okay to privatize parts of the commons as long
    as &#8220;enough and as good&#8221; is left for everyone forever. Enough
    in the case of an ecosystem means enough to keep it alive and healthy. That
    much, or more, should be part of the commons, even if parts of the ecosystem
    are private. In the case of culture and science, enough means enough to assure
    a vibrant public domain. Exclusive licenses, such as patents and copyrights,
    should be kept to a minimum.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">PUT FUTURE GENERATIONS FIRST</font></strong></p>
  <p>Corporations put the interests of stockholders first, while government puts
    the interests of campaign donors and living voters first. No one at the moment
    puts future generations first. That&#8217;s Job Number One for the commons
    sector.</p>
  <p>In practice, this means trustees of common property should be legally accountable
    to future generations. (We&#8217;ll see how this might work in chapter 6.)
    They should also be bound by the precautionary principle: when in doubt,
    err on the side of safety. And when faced with a conflict between short-term
    gain and long-term preservation, they should be required to choose the latter.</p>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>THE MORE THE MERRIER</strong></font></p>
  <p>Whereas private property is inherently exclusive, common property strives
    to be inclusive. It always wants more co-owners or participants, consistent
    with preservation of the asset.</p>
  <p>This organizing principle applies most clearly to commons like culture and
    the Internet, where physical limits are absent and increasing use unleashes
    synergies galore. It also applies to social compacts like Social Security
    and Medicare, which require universal participation. In these compacts, financial
    mechanisms express our solidarity with other members of our national community.
    They&#8217;re efficient and fair because they include everybody. Were they
    to operate under profit-maximizing principles, they&#8217;d inevitably exclude
    the poor (who couldn&#8217;t afford to participate) and anyone deemed by
    private insurers to be too risky.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></p>
  <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
    one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded on
    the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural assets,
    it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and income rights.
    It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons equally, but
    everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from selling limited
    usage rights.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
    Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
      of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent Fund shows, it&#8217;s
      possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</p>
  <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on liquidity,
    but also on attention. People would notice common property if they got income
    from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it, and talk about it. Concern
    for invisible commons would soar.</p>
  <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since common
    property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable the way
    corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t reap capital
    gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income stakes throughout
    their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent, royalties, interest,
    and dividends.</p>
