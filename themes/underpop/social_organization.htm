<p align="center">(that is, the organization of society)</p>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/02_SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
    Increasing Importance of Social Questions</a> (Chapter 1 of <strong><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm"><em>Social
    Problems</em></a></strong>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[03] Between the development of society and the development of species there
    is a close analogy. In the lowest forms of animal life there is little difference
    of parts; both wants and powers are few and simple; movement seems automatic;
    and instincts are scarcely distinguishable from those of the vegetable. So
    homogeneous are some of these living things, that if cut in pieces, each
    piece still lives. But as life rises into higher manifestations, simplicity
    gives way to complexity, the parts develop into organs having separate functions
    and reciprocal relations, new wants and powers arise, and a greater and greater
    degree of intelligence is needed to secure food and avoid danger. Did fish,
    bird or beast possess no higher intelligence than the polyp, nature could
    bring them forth only to die.</p>
  <p>[04] This law &#8212; that the increasing complexity and delicacy of organization
    which give higher capacity and increased power are accompanied by increased
    wants and dangers, and require, therefore, increased intelligence &#8212; runs
    through nature. In the ascending scale of life at last comes man, the most
    highly and delicately organized of animals. Yet not only do his higher powers
    require for their use a higher intelligence than exists in other animals,
    but without higher intelligence he could not live. His skin is too thin;
    his nails too brittle; he is too poorly adapted for running, climbing, swimming
    or burrowing. Were he not gifted with intelligence greater than that of any
    beast, he would perish from cold, starve from inability to get food, or be
    exterminated by animals better equipped for the struggle in which brute instinct
    suffices.</p>
  <p>[05] In man, however, the intelligence which increases all through nature's
    rising scale passes at one bound into an intelligence so superior, that the
    difference seems of kind rather than degree. In him, that narrow and seemingly
    unconscious intelligence that we call instinct becomes conscious reason,
    and the godlike power of adaptation and invention makes feeble man nature's
    king.</p>
  <p>[06] But with man the ascending line stops. Animal life assumes no higher
    form; nor can we affirm that, in all his generations, man, as an animal,
    has a whit improved. But progression in another line begins. Where the development
    of species ends, social development commences, and that advance of society
    that we call civilization so increases human powers, that between savage
    and civilized man there is a gulf so vast as to suggest the gulf between
    the highly organized animal and the oyster glued to the rocks. And with every
    advance upon this line new vistas open. When we try to think what knowledge
    and power progressive civilization may give to the men of the future, imagination
    fails.</p>
  <p>[07] In this progression which begins with man, as in that which leads up
    to him, the same law holds. Each advance makes a demand for higher and higher
    intelligence. With the beginnings of society arises the need for social intelligence &#8212; for
    that consensus of individual intelligence which forms a public opinion, a
    public conscience, a public will, and is manifested in law, institutions
    and administration. As society develops, a higher and higher degree of this
    social intelligence is required, for the relation of individuals to each
    other becomes more intimate and important, and the increasing complexity
    of the social organization brings liability to new dangers.</p>
  <p>[08] In the rude beginning, each family produces its own food, makes its
    own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves, furnishes its own
    transportation. Compare with this independence the intricate interdependence
    of the denizens of a modern city. They may supply themselves with greater
    certainty, and in much greater variety and abundance, than the savage; but
    it is by the cooperation of thousands. Even the water they drink, and the
    artificial light they use, are brought to them by elaborate machinery, requiring
    the constant labor and watchfulness of many men. They may travel at a speed
    incredible to the savage; but in doing so resign life and limb to the care
    of others. A broken rail, a drunken engineer, a careless switchman, may hurl
    them to eternity. And the power of applying labor to the satisfaction of
    desire passes, in the same way, beyond the direct control of the individual.
    The laborer becomes but part of a great machine, which may at any time be
    paralyzed by causes beyond his power, or even his foresight. Thus does the
    well-being of each become more and more dependent upon the well-being of
    all &#8212; the individual more and more subordinate to society.</p>
  <p>[09] And so come new dangers. The rude society resembles the creatures that
    though cut into pieces will live; the highly civilized society is like a
    highly organized animal: a stab in a vital part, the suppression of a single
    function, is death. A savage village may be burned and its people driven
    off &#8212; but, used to direct recourse to nature, they can maintain themselves.
    Highly civilized man, however, accustomed to capital, to machinery, to the
    minute division of labor, becomes helpless when suddenly deprived of these
    and thrown upon nature. Under the factory system, some sixty persons, with
    the aid of much costly machinery, cooperate to the making of a pair of shoes.
    But, of the sixty, not one could make a whole shoe. This is the tendency
    in all branches of production, even in agriculture. How many farmers of the
    new generation can use the flail? How many farmers' wives can now make a
    coat from the wool? Many of our farmers do not even make their own butter
    or raise their own vegetables! There is an enormous gain in productive power
    from this division of labor, which assigns to the individual the production
    of but a few of the things, or even but a small part of one of the things,
    he needs, and makes each dependent upon others with whom he never comes in
    contact; but the social organization becomes more sensitive. A primitive
    village community may pursue the even tenor of its life without feeling disasters
    which overtake other villages but a few miles off; but in the closely knit
    civilization to which we have attained, a war, a scarcity, a commercial crisis,
    in one hemisphere produces powerful effects in the other, while shocks and
    jars from which a primitive community easily recovers would to a highly civilized
    community mean wreck.</p>
  <p>[10] It is startling to think how destructive in a civilization like ours
    would be such fierce conflicts as fill the history of the past. The wars
    of highly civilized countries, since the opening of the era of steam and
    machinery, have been duels of armies rather than conflicts of peoples or
    classes. Our only glimpse of what might happen, wore passion fully aroused,
    was in the struggle of the Paris Commune. And, since 1870, to the knowledge
    of petroleum has been added that of even more destructive agents. The explosion
    of a little nitro-glycerin under a few water-mains would make a great city
    uninhabitable; the blowing up of a few railroad bridges and tunnels would
    bring famine quicker than the wall of circumvallation that Titus drew around
    Jerusalem; the pumping of atmospheric air into the gas-mains, and the application
    of a match, would tear up every street and level every house. The Thirty
    Years' War set back civilization in Germany; so fierce a war now would all
    but destroy it. Not merely have destructive powers vastly increased, but
    the whole social organization has become vastly more delicate.</p>
  <p>[13] There is in all the past nothing to compare with the rapid changes
    now going on in the civilized world. It seems as though in the European race,
    and in the nineteenth century, man was just beginning to live &#8212; just
    grasping his tools and becoming conscious of his powers. The snail's pace
    of crawling ages has suddenly become the headlong rush of the locomotive,
    speeding faster and faster. This rapid progress is primarily in industrial
    methods and material powers. But industrial changes imply social changes
    and necessitate political changes. Progressive societies outgrow institutions
    as children outgrow clothes. Social progress always requires greater intelligence
    in the management of public affairs; but this the more as progress is rapid
    and change quicker.</p>
  <p>[14] And that the rapid changes now going on are bringing up problems that
    demand most earnest attention may be seen on every hand. Symptoms of danger,
    premonitions of violence, are appearing all over the civilized world. Creeds
    are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces of conservatism are melting
    away. Political institutions are failing, as clearly in democratic America
    as in monarchical Europe. There is growing unrest and bitterness among the
    masses, whatever be the form of government, a blind groping for escape from
    conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute all this to the teachings of
    demagogues is like attributing the fever to the quickened pulse. It is the
    new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles. To put into a sailing-ship
    the powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer would be to tear her
    to pieces with their play. So the new powers rapidly changing all the relations
    of society must shatter social and political organizations not adapted to
    meet their strain.</p>
  <p>[15] To adjust our institutions to growing needs and changing conditions
    is the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism, human sympathy,
    and religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake it. There is danger
    in reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism. The problems
    beginning to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that there is fear they
    may not be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes. But their gravity
    comes from indisposition to recognize frankly and grapple boldly with them.</p>
  <p>[16] These dangers, which menace not one country alone, but modern civilization
    itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling to be born &#8212; that
    the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown conditions and institutions
    that before sufficed.</p>
  <p>[17] A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands
    of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably
    evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization is possible in which
    the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the
    rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies
    unthought of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence
    that will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are already
    in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment
    from the very excess of wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say
    manufacturers, &quot;and we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give
    us but work!&quot; cry idle men.</p>
  <p>[18] The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
    of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
    of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
    forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
    produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
    Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
    but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet
    agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years
    ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption,
    we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph
    of mechanical skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had
    to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New
    York aldermen. The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned
    in a crazed and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only
    by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass
    is estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer could
    not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable.</p>
  <p>[19] The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
    be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few, but
    that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political
    economy to college professors. The people themselves must think, because
    the people alone can act.</p>
  <p>[20] In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
                  the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
                  This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
                  having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But the
                  salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of humanity,
                  is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ.
                  Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more the
                  business of
                  each; it binds
                  all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can
                  escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares
                  for his
                  family, yet
                  takes
                  no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those
                  who are trodden under foot, save now and then to bestow aims,
                  is not
                  a true Christian.
                  Nor
                  is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder
                  than this.</p>
  <p>[21] The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not
    a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
    and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond self-interest,
    whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many. It must seek justice.
    For at the bottom of every social problem we will find a social wrong. </p>
