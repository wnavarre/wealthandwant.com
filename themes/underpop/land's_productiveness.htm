<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>    a. Explanation of Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Differences in the desirableness of land divide Wealth into the two funds,
    Wages and Rent. Labor naturally applies its forces to that land from which,
    considering all the existing and known circumstances, most Wealth can be
    produced with least expenditure of labor force. Such land is the best. So
    long as the best land exceeds demand for it, laborers are upon an equality
    of opportunity, and the entire product goes to them as Wages in proportion
    to the labor force they respectively expend. But when the supply of the best
    land falls below demand for it, some laborers must resort to land where with
    an equal expenditure of labor force they produce less wealth than those who
    use the best land. The laborers thus excluded from the best land naturally
    offer a premium for it, or what is the same thing, offer to work for its
    owners for what they might obtain by working for themselves upon the poorer
    land. This condition differentiates Rent from Wages. Rent goes to land-owners
    as such, irrespective of whether they labor or not; Wages go to laborers
    as such, irrespective of whether they own land or not.85</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">85. Land of every kind may vary in desirableness from other land of the
        same kind. Certain farming land, for example, is so fertile that it will
        yield to a given application of labor two bushels of wheat to every bushel
        that certain other farming land will yield; and it is obvious that, other
        things being equal, farmers would prefer the more fertile land. But some
        fertile land lies so far away from market that less fertile land lying nearer
        is more productive, because it costs less to exchange its products for what
        their producer demands; in such cases farmers would prefer the less fertile
        land. The same principle applies to all kinds of land. Building lots at or
        near a center of residence or business are preferable for most purposes of
        residence or business to lots equally good in other respects which are far
        away.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now, the land that is preferable is of course most in demand; and if it
        be all in use, with demand for it unsatisfied, competition for the preference
        sets in, and gives value to it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">All land cannot be equally desirable. Some excels in fertility. Some is
        rich with mineral deposits, a species of fertility. On some, towns and cities
        settle, thereby adding to the productiveness of the labor that uses it, because
        these sites are thus made centers of co-operation or trade. And yet production
        in the civilized state requires that the producer shall have exclusive possession
        of the land lie needs. This necessity inevitably gives to some people more
        desirable land than others have, even though all should have an abundance.
        Consequently the returns to equal labor are unequal. The man who has land
        that is more fertile or better located than that of another gets more wealth
        than the other in return for a given expenditure of labor. If, for example,
        one with given labor produces 10 bushels of corn from fertile land, equal,
        say, to $5 worth of any kind of wealth in the market, and the other with
        the same labor produces 8 bushels of corn, or $4 worth of any kind of wealth
        in the market, the first receives 2 bushels (or $1) more for his labor than
        the other receives for his, though each labors with equal effort, skill,
        and intelligence. Or, if the fertility of the land be the same, but its situation
        in reference to the market be such that the cost of transportation still
        preserves the relation of $5 to $4, the same inequality of wages results.
        It is this phenomenon that gives rise to Rent. Rent is the market value of
        just such differences in opportunity as are here illustrated. It is a premium
        for choice land, for preferential locations, for site, for space.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">This premium is a very different thing from compensation for labor. Nor
        is the difference modified when premium owners first obtain Wages for work
        and with them buy the premium-commanding land. Rent can no more be turned
        into compensation for labor by exchanging labor products for the power to
        exact it, than a man can be turned into Wealth by exchanging Wealth for him.
        Whether the fruits of purchase or of conquest, or of fraud, Rent always constitutes
        that part of Wealth which is deducted from current production as premiums
        for superior opportunities for production.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Wages and Rent are both drawn from Wealth, and both go often to the same
        individual and in the same form of payment, as when a freehold farmer enjoys
        the use of the grain he raises from more fertile land than his neighbors
        have, or a city freeholder occupies or receives hire from his house and lot:
        but Wages flow from Wealth to labor as compensation for production, while
        Rent flows from Wealth to land-owners in premiums for allowing labor to produce
        Wealth from superior locations. Wages are appurtenant to Labor; Rent is appurtenant
        to Land. It is as laborer that the individual takes Wages, but as land-owner
        that he takes Rent.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To illustrate: On the following page are four closed spaces representing
    land which varies in productiveness to a given expenditure of labor force,
    86 from 4 down to 1. There is also an open space at the right, representing
    land that is yet so poor as to yield nothing to the given expenditure of
    labor force. Thus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">86. A unit of labor cannot be definitely measured save by the value of some
        labor product. The day's labor of one man may produce less than an hour's
        labor of another. But for purposes of illustration it is competent to refer
        to a unit of labor force as an abstraction, intending thereby to denote all
        the labor of muscle and brain requisite to acquire the necessary knowledge
        and skill and to produce wealth to a given value from given natural sources.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>For simplicity let the market be equally convenient to each space.
                            Let it be assumed also that one space is as accessible
                to labor as another,
                                and
                                that the differences in their productiveness
    are known. Now, to which space would labor first resort? Obviously to
                that which
                          would
                            yield most
                              Wealth
                                to the given expenditure of labor force &#8212; the
                                space to the extreme left.</p>
  <p>Suppose, then, that labor appropriates only as much of the best space as
    is required for use &#8212; say half of it. We may note the fact with red
    color upon the chart: [chart]</p>
