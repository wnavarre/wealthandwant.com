<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Enthusiastic proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas have often presented
    them as a panacea for the economic, social and environmental problems that
    beset contemporary society. Indeed, the Georgist analysis does have much
    to offer. By more adequately addressing land as a unique economic, social
    and ecological resource, it can help to reveal underlying causes of currently
    pressing issues such as declining housing affordability, growing economic
    inequality, and environmental decay.</p>
  <p>The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217; can also play an important role
    in the redress of these problems. However, there are limitations to the modern
    application of George&#8217;s ideas, as outlined in this article. While a
    uniform land tax is a necessary component in addressing contemporary political
    economic problems, it is not sufficient. It needs to be set in the context
    of a broader political economic analysis and policy program, also addressing
    public housing, urban and regional policies, environmental taxes and regulations, &#8216;floors
    and ceilings&#8217; to limit income inequalities and macroeconomic stabilisation.</p>
  <p>While the Georgist analysis redresses the general neglect of land in modern
    economic orthodoxy, it is important not to go too far to the other extreme.
    In other words, the important emphasis on land should not come at the expense
    of attention to problems associated with labour and capital and to the complex
    forms of government policy necessary for the balancing of contemporary economic,
    social and ecological concerns. The Georgist analysis needs to be integrated
    into a comprehensive political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism.</p>
  <p>So what does &#8216;putting Henry George in his place&#8217; entail? It
                means recognising the political economic importance of land and
    the potential social gains from the extension of land taxation. Equally,
    it means recognising
                the necessity of relating Georgist ideas and policy prescriptions
    to a broader canvas of modern political economy, including the analytical
    traditions associated
                with Karl Marx, J. M. Keynes, and J. K. Galbraith, and modern
    environmental economics. Henry George&#8217;s place is in good company. <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sometime around 1950, capitalism entered a new phase. Until then, poverty
        was a widely shared American experience. Wages were low, hours were long,
        and unemployment was a wolf at almost every door. In the 1930s, it reached
        25 percent.</p>
      <p>This changed in the period following World War II. In 1958, economist
        John Kenneth Galbraith wrote a best-seller called The Affluent Society
        in which he noted that scarcity of goods was now a thing of the past
        for a majority of Americans. &#8220;The ordinary individual has access
        to amenities &#8212; foods, entertainment, personal transportation and
        plumbing &#8212; in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago,&#8221; Galbraith
        observed. &#8220;So great has been the change that many of the desires
        of the individual are no longer even evident to him. They become so only
        as they are synthesized, elaborated, and nurtured by advertising and
        salesmanship, and these, in turn, have become among our most important
        and talented professions.&#8221;</p>
      <p>This was a major phase change for capitalism. Before, people wanted
        more goods than the economy could provide. Demand, in other words, exceeded
        supply, and we lived in what might be called shortage capitalism. We
        could also call it Capitalism 1.0.</p>
      <p>After the change, we shifted into surplus capitalism, or what I call
        Capitalism 2.0. In this version, there&#8217;s no limit to what corporations
        can produce; their problem is finding buyers. A sizeable chunk of GDP
        is spent to make people want this unneeded output. And credit is lavishly
        extended so they can buy it.</p>
      <p>This historic shift can be described another way. A century ago, our
        chief scarcity was goods. It thus made sense to sacrifice other things
        in pursuit of goods, and capitalism was masterful at doing this. Today
        we&#8217;re waist-deep in thneeds, and our scarcities are different.
        Among the middle classes, the top scarcities, I&#8217;d say, are time,
        companionship, and community (see figure 2.2). Among the poor, there
        remains a lack of goods, but that lack isn&#8217;t due to a shortage
        of production capacity &#8212; it&#8217;s due to the poor&#8217;s inability
        to pay. The critical scarcity here, in other words, is income. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
