<blockquote>
  <p>a founding partner of the law firm Shearman and Sterling, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Louis Post: <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures,
with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Note 2: In &quot;<em>Progress and Poverty</em>,&quot; book viii, ch. iv, Henry
    George speaks of &quot;the effect of substituting for the manifold taxes
    now imposed, a single tax on the value of land&quot;; but the term did not
    become a distinctive name until 1888.</p>
  <p>The first general movement along the lines of &quot;<em>Progress and Poverty</em>&quot; began
    New York City election of 1886, when Henry George polled 68,110 votes as
    an independent candidate for mayor, and was defeated by the Democratic candidate,
    Abram S. Hewitt, by a plurality of only 22,442, the Republican, Theodore
    Roosevelt, polling but 60,435. Following that election the United Labor Party
    was formed, the Syracuse Convention in August, 1887, by the exclusion of
    the Socialists, came to present the central idea of &quot;<em>Progress and
    Poverty</em>&quot; as
    distinguished from the Socialistic propaganda which until then was identified
    with it. Coincident with the organization of the United Labor Party the Anti-Poverty
    Society was formed; and the two bodies, one representing the political and
    the other the religious phase of the idea, worked together until President
    Cleveland's tariff message of 1887 appeared. In this message Mr. George saw
    the timid beginnings of that open struggle between protection and free trade
    to which he had for years looked forward as the political movement that must
    culminate in the abolition of all taxes save those upon land values, and
    he responded at once to the sentiments of the message. But many protectionists,
    who had followed him because they supposed he was a land nationalizer, now
    broke away from his leadership, and the United Labor Party and the Anti-Poverty
    Society were soon practically dissolved. Those who understood Mr. George's
    real position regarding the land question readily acquiesced in his views
    as to political policy, and a considerable movement resulted, which, however,
    for some time lacked an identifying name. This was the situation when <strong>Thomas
    G. Shearman, Esq.</strong>, wrote for the <em>Standard</em> an article on taxation in which
    he illustrated and advocated the land value tax as a fiscal measure. The
    article had been submitted without a caption, and Mr. George, then the editor
    of the <em>Standard</em>, entitled it &quot;The Single Tax.&quot; This title was at
    once adopted by the &quot;George men,&quot; as they were often called, and
    has ever since served as the name of the movement it describes. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
      nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
      of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of
      holding land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
      changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be
      held nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of
      machinery as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual
  and potential Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>

      pay all the present expenses of American government &#8212; federal, state,

  <p>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?<br>
    A. <strong>Thomas G. Shearman</strong>, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
      of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
      potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
      not is as yet an unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised
      from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while
      any land value remains in private possession. Until land values are exhausted
      the taxation of labor cannot be excused. ... <a href="../../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

  <p><em>Q57. Would the single tax yield sufficient revenue for all government
      purposes, local, state, and national?</em><br>
A. Careful estimates by Mr. Thomas G. Shearman indicate that all present taxes
amount to not much more than one half of the annual site value of the land. But
he said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The honest needs of public government grow faster than population and
      fully as fast as wealth itself. Local taxation will increase rapidly; and
      it ought to do so..... This does not imply that ground rent will not be
      sufficient to supply many, possibly all, of those additions to human happiness
      which Henry George has pictured in such glowing words. But such extensions
      of the sphere of government must take place gradually; or they will be
      ruinous failures, simply because the state cannot at once furnish the necessary
      machinery for their successful operation. ... <a href="../../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read
