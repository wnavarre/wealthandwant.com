<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m a businessman. I believe society should reward successful initiative
    with profit. At the same time, I know that profit-seeking activities have
    unhealthy side effects. They cause pollution, waste, inequality, anxiety,
    and no small amount of confusion about the purpose of life.</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m also a liberal, in the sense that I&#8217;m not averse to a role
    for government in society. Yet history has convinced me that representative
    government can&#8217;t adequately protect the interests of ordinary citizens.
    Even less can it protect the interests of future generations, ecosystems,
    and nonhuman species. The reason is that most &#8212; though not all &#8212; of
    the time, government puts the interests of private corporations first. This
    is a systemic problem of a capitalist democracy, not just a matter of electing
    new leaders.</p>
  <p>If you identify with the preceding sentiments, then you might be
              confused and demoralized, as I have been lately. If capitalism
          as we know
                it is deeply flawed, and government is no savior, where lies
          hope? This strikes
                  me as
                    one of the great dilemmas of our time. For years the Right
              has been saying &#8212; nay,
                    shouting &#8212; that government is flawed and that only privatization, deregulation,
                    and tax cuts can save us. For just as long, the Left has been insisting that
                    markets are flawed and that only government can save us. The trouble is that
                    both sides are half-right and half-wrong. They&#8217;re both right that markets
                    and state are flawed, and both wrong that salvation lies in either sphere.
                    But if that&#8217;s the case, what are we to do? Is there,
                    perhaps, a missing set of institutions that can help us?
                    ... </p>
  <p>For much of this time I was president of Working Assets, a company that
    donates 1 percent of its gross sales to nonprofit groups working for a better
    world. These donations come off its top line, not its bottom line; the company
    makes them whether it&#8217;s profitable or not (and many years we were not).
    It occurred to me that 1 percent is an exceedingly small portion of sales
    for any business to return to the larger world, given that businesses take
    so much from the larger world without paying. How, for example, could we
    make any goods without nature&#8217;s many free gifts? And how could we sell
    them without society&#8217;s vast infrastructure of laws, roads, money, and
    so on? At the very least, I liked to think, we ought to pay a 1 percent royalty
    for the privilege of being a limited liability corporation. ... </p>
  <p> In retrospect, I realized the question I&#8217;d been asking since early
      adulthood was: Is capitalism a brilliant solution to the problem of scarcity,
      or is it itself modernity&#8217;s central problem? The question has many
      layers, but explorations of each layer led me to the same verdict. Although
      capitalism started as a brilliant solution, it has become the central problem
      of our day. It was right for its time, but times have changed.</p>
  <p>When capitalism started, nature was abundant and capital was scarce; it
    thus made sense to reward capital above all else. Today we&#8217;re awash
    in capital and literally running out of nature. We&#8217;re also losing many
    social arrangements that bind us together as communities and enrich our lives
    in nonmonetary ways. This doesn&#8217;t mean capitalism is doomed or useless,
    but it does mean we have to modify it. We have to adapt it to the twenty-first
    century rather than the eighteenth. ...</p>
  <p>    <strong>The <em>dramatis personae </em>throughout the book are corporations,
      government, and the commons. </strong>The plot goes something like this. As the curtain rises, corporations
      are gobbling up the commons. They&#8217;re the big boys on the block, and
      the commons &#8212; an unorganized m&eacute;lange of nature, community,
      and culture &#8212; is the constant loser. It has no property rights of
      its own, so must rely on government for protection. But government is a
      fickle guardian that tilts heavily toward corporations.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, corporations only dominate government most of the time; every
    once in a while, they lose their grip. So it&#8217;s possible to imagine
    that the next time corporate dominance ebbs, government &#8212; acting on
    behalf of commoners &#8212; swiftly fortifies the commons. It assigns new
    property rights to commons trusts, builds commons infrastructure, and spawns
    a new class of genuine co-owners. When corporations regain political dominance,
    as they inevitably will, they can&#8217;t undo the new system. The commons
    now has safeguards and stakeholders; it&#8217;s entrenched for the long haul.
    And in time, corporations accept the commons as their business partner. They
    find they can still make profits, plan farther ahead, and even become more
    globally competitive. <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Limits of Regulation</p>
  <p>The idea of regulation is that, while markets should ideally be as free
    as possible, there are times when an external actor, not driven by profit
    maximization, must impose some rules for the common good. When it comes to
    nature, government has many ways to regulate.</p>
  <p> * It may require timely disclosure of toxic releases.<br>
  * It may grant, sell, or deny rights to use public resources.<br>
  * It may ban some pollutants altogether, limit others, or tell polluters what
  technologies to use.<br>
  * It may divide the landscape into zones and specify what kinds of activities
  can take place in each zone.<br>
  * It may tax certain activities and subsidize others.</p>
  <p>This wide array of tools &#8212; plus the power to prosecute rulebreakers &#8212; seemingly
    creates in government a formidable counterweight to corporations. Yet history
    has shown that government isn&#8217;t the regulatory tiger it appears to
    be. It faces fierce corporate resistance whenever it tries to exercise its
    powers. And time after time, its regulatory agencies have been captured by
    the industries they were intended to regulate.</p>
  <p>The process of regulatory capture has been described by many scholars. Details
    vary, but the plot is always the same. A new agency is created to regulate
    an industry that&#8217;s harming the public. At first the agency acts boldly,
    but over time its zeal wanes. Reformers who originally staffed the agency
    are replaced by people who either worked in the industry earlier, or hope
    to do so after a stint in government. Industry-packed &#8220;advisory committees&#8221; multiply,
    while industry-funded &#8220;think tanks&#8221; add a veneer of legitimacy
    to profit-driven proposals. Lobbyists meet constantly with agency staffers.
    The public, meanwhile, has no clue about what&#8217;s going on.</p>
  <p>This process has reached extreme proportions in recent years. As I write,
    the head of public lands in the Interior Department is a former mining industry
    lobbyist, the head of the air division at the EPA is a former utility lobbyist,
    the second in command at EPA is an ex-Monsanto lobbyist, and the head of
    Superfund cleanups at EPA (which makes industry clean up its toxic wastes)
    formerly advised companies on how to evade Superfund. Although today&#8217;s
    pro-industry bias may be more egregious than usual, the absence of outrage
    or resistance suggests it&#8217;s not far from the norm.</p>
  <p>And it&#8217;s not just regulatory agencies that have been captured. Congress
    itself, which oversees the agencies and writes their controlling laws, has
    been badly infected. According to the Center for Public Integrity, the &#8220;influence
    industry&#8221; in Washington now spends $6 billion a year and employs more
    than thirty-five thousand lobbyists, some two hundred of whom are former
    Congress members who enjoy easy access to their erstwhile colleagues.</p>
  <p>A glimpse at the corporate lobbying game shows just how rewarding it is.
    MBNA, the nation&#8217;s largest credit card bank, spent over $17 million
    on lobbying between 1999 and 2004. This is pin money compared to the sums
    it will reap from an industry-drafted bankruptcy overhaul, passed in 2005,
    which precludes all but the very poor from wiping out their debts and starting
    anew. (The great majority of Americans who file for bankruptcy are middle-class
    victims of job loss, huge medical bills, or family breakup.) A New York Times
    reporter described this scene as the bill was being marked up: &#8220;Lawyers
    and lobbyists jammed Congressional hearing rooms to overflowing. . . . During
    breaks, there was a common, almost comical pattern. The pinstriped lobbyists
    ran into the hallway, grabbed tiny cell phones from their pockets or briefcases,
    and reported back to their clients, almost always with the news they wanted
    to hear.&#8221; ...</p>
  <p>Three points are worth making here.</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> First, ownership isn&#8217;t the same thing as trusteeship. Owners of
              property &#8212; even government owners &#8212; have wide latitude to
              do whatever they want with it; a trustee does not. Trustees are bound
              by the
              terms of their trust and by centuries-old principles of trusteeship,
              foremost among which is &#8220;undivided loyalty&#8221; to beneficiaries.</li>
      <li> Second, in a capitalist democracy, the state is a dispenser of many
              valuable prizes. Whoever amasses the most political power wins
        the most valuable prizes.
            The rewards include property rights, friendly regulators, subsidies,
            tax breaks, and free or cheap use of the commons. The notion that
        the state
              promotes &#8220;the
            common good&#8221; is sadly naive.</li>
      <li> Third, while free marketers are fond of saying that capitalism is
        a precondition for democracy, what they neglect to add is that capitalism
                  also distorts democracy.
                  Like gravity, its tug is constant. The bigger the concentrations
          of capital, the stronger the tug.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>We face a disheartening quandary here. Profit-maximizing corporations dominate
          our economy. Their programming makes them enclose and diminish common wealth.
          The only obvious counterweight is government, yet government is dominated
        by these same corporations.</p>
      <p>One possible way out of this dilemma is to reprogram corporations &#8212; that
          is, to make them driven by something other than profit. This, however, is
          like asking elephants to dance &#8212; they&#8217;re just not built to do
          it. Corporations are built to make money, and the truth is, as a society
          we want them to make money. We&#8217;ll look at this further in the next
        chapter.</p>
      <p>Another possible way out is to liberate government from corporations, not
          just momentarily, but long-lastingly. This is easier said than done. Corporations
          have decimated their old adversary, organized labor, and turned the media
          into their mouthpiece. Occasionally a breakthrough is made in campaign financing &#8212; for
          example, corporations are now barred from giving so-called soft money to
          political parties &#8212; but corporate money soon finds other channels to
        flow through. The return on such investments is simply too high to stop them.</p>
      <p>Does this mean there&#8217;s no hope? I don&#8217;t think so. The window
          of opportunity is small, but not nonexistent. Throughout American history,
          anticorporate forces have come to power once or twice per century.
        In the nineteenth century, we had the eras of Jackson and Lincoln; in
        the twentieth
          century, those of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty-first century
        equivalents will, I&#8217;m sure, arise. It may take a calamity of some
        sort &#8212; another
          war, a depression, or an ecological disaster &#8212; to trigger the
          next anticorporate ascendancy, but sooner or later it will come. Our
          job is to
        be ready when it comes. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
