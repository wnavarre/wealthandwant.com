<p>Lesson 63 of Bengough's Primer</p>
<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
  <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for rainy
    days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage people to
    take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for community service.
    For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
    anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
    It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes it
    harder for the poor to rise.</p>
  <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
    through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common property?
    One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted earlier, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to invest in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments pays yearly dividends
    to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended to any state or nation,
    whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent
    Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The
    reason is, we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
  <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could crank
    down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution permits.
    The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go. Less pollution
    would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars could flow into
    an American Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil revenue
    is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an American Permanent
    Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying dividends to citizens
    is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are priced above zero, the
    cost of living will go up and people will need compensation; this wasn&#8217;t,
    and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the
    government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods, rather than tossing
    them into the general treasury. This not only ensures identifiable public
    benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll defend the revenue
    sharing system.</p>
  <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
    Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
    to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
    their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
    The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
    buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
    of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth roughly
    $5 trillion.</p>
  <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of the
    population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted to,
    we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations for
    using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For those
    of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering, investment
    bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public charges
    almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact hefty
    fees.)</p>
  <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
    publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
    in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
    10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using a
    regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
    liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
    bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
  <p><strong>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified
                portfolio worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart,
                it
                  would pay equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock
          market rose and fell,
                    so
                      would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would
                      lift all boats. America would truly be an &#8220;ownership
        society.&#8221;</strong> ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
