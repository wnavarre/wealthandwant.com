    <p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political
    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><a href="../../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm"><em>Social Problems</em></a></strong>,
1883)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <span class="style1">[01] </span>THE American  Republic is today unquestionably foremost of the nations &mdash; the van  leader of modern civilization. Of all the great peoples of the European  family, her people are the most homogeneous, the most active and most  assimilative. Their average standard of intelligence and comfort is  higher; they have most fully adopted modern industrial improvements,  and are quickest to utilize discovery and invention; their political  institutions are most in accordance with modern ideas, their position  exempts them from dangers and difficulties besetting the European  nations, and a vast area of unoccupied land gives them room to grow.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[02] </span>At the rate of increase so far maintained, the English-speaking  people of America will, by the close of the century, number nearly one  hundred million &mdash; a population as large as owned the sway of Rome in  her palmiest days. By the middle of the next century &mdash; a time which  children now born will live to see &mdash; they will, at the same rate,  number more than the present population of Europe; and by its close  nearly equal the population which, at the beginning of this century,  the whole earth was believed to contain.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[03]</span> <strong>But the increase of power is more rapid than the increase of  population, and goes on in accelerating progression. </strong>Discovery and  invention stimulate discovery and invention; and it is only when we  consider that the industrial progress of the last fifty years bids fair  to pale before the achievements of the next that we can vaguely imagine  the future that seems opening before the American people. The center of  wealth, of art, of luxury and learning, must pass to this side of the  Atlantic even before the center of population. It seems as if this  continent had been reserved &mdash; shrouded for ages from the rest of the  world &mdash; as the field upon which European civilization might freely  bloom. And for the very reason that our growth is so rapid and our  progress so swift; for the very reason that all the tendencies of  modern civilization assert themselves here more quickly and strongly  than anywhere else, the problems which modern civilization must meet,  will here first fully present themselves, and will most imperiously  demand to be thought out or fought out.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[04]</span> It is difficult for any one to turn from the history of the past  to think of the incomparable greatness promised by the rapid growth of  the United States without something of awe &mdash; something of that feeling  which induced Amasis of Egypt to dissolve his alliance with the  successful Polycrates, because "the gods do not permit to mortals such  prosperity." Of this, at least, we may be certain: the rapidity of our  development brings dangers that can be guarded against only by alert  intelligence and earnest patriotism.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural. Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights  of the citizen, and political organization always starts from this  base. <strong>It is as social development goes on that we find power  concentrating, in institutions based upon the equality of rights  passing into institutions which make the many the slaves of the few. </strong>How this is we may see. In all institutions which involve the lodgment  of governing power there is, with social growth, a tendency to the  exaltation of their function and the centralization of their power, and  in the stronger of these institutions a tendency to the absorption of  the powers of the rest. Thus the tendency of social growth is to make  government the business of a special class. And as numbers increase and  the power and importance of each become less and less as compared with  that of all, so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond  the scrutiny and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of  warriors, or head man of a little village, can command or govern only  by common consent, and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his  fellows. But when a tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a  populous country, the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition,  become practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny  of his acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder  successfully to appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he  directs becomes irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as  power thus concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of  thought grows up which regards the masses as born but for the service  of their rulers.<br>
<span class="style1"><br>
[07]</span> <strong>Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual  conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the  people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class</strong> &mdash;  though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles and a  hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and  hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but  follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each knows  his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city,  as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers  to gain and hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and  even in our State legislatures, the growth of the country and the  greater number of interests make the proportion of the votes of a  representative, of which his constituents know or care to know, less  and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial departments tend  constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[08]</span> But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the  changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of  steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the  concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by  hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;  small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen  of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues  and payrolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this  concentration grows the facility of combination among these great  business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal  operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers, combine,  either to regulate prices or to use the powers of government! The  tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation of rings  against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[09]</span> It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great  aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to  corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of the  people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars &mdash; except two  million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in power, no  matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for reform, for it  instinctively fears change. It never struggles against misgovernment.  When threatened by the holders of political power it does not agitate,  nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is in this way, no less  than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth corrupts  government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our organized lobbies,  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon  the hopes of moneyed interests. When "business" is dull, their resource  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat.  So, too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political  funds, on the principle of keeping on the right side of those in power,  just as the railroad companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes  to Florida to fish.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[10]</span> The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence. A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake. <a href="../../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>
