<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An
Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
  in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br />
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br />
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br />
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br />
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br />
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br />
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br />
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>  1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</em></strong> (5.)</p>
  <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
    Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
    by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
  <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
    it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
    as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
    To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land
    to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
  <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
    the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold
    it as his own private possession.</p>
  <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
    for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
    he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only
    to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he
    pleases.</p>
  <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for greater
    security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages in another
    form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
    be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
  <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
    for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country, in
    my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
    defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
    bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the
    people. By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children
    from parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the
    buying and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
    with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived
    sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of
    his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here
    is a poor widow; all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes,
    the earnings of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by
    freeing these negroes?&#8221; And because of this perversion of reason, this
    confounding of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
    of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation
    a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
  <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
    property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same
    error into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same;
    it is essentially the same. Private property in land, no less than private
    property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. They are
    different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
    ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
    God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
  <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
    man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
    master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
    to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
    Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
  <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
    of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
    neck.</p>
  <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor of another
    without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully as chattel
    slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
    enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
    of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil
    do the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves
    of our Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner
    of Europe in ruder times to demand the <em>jus primae noctis</em>? Does not the same
    last outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
    wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
  <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
    on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine enriched
    their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men, they gave
    land. <strong>And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no
    free land remains to which the landless man may turn, then without further
    violence
    the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property in
    land takes the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient.
    For under it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when
    not needed. He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when
    no longer wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as
    efficacious. </strong>This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English
    conquerors of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land.
    This is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World, not
    to Europe.</p>
  <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
    form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in more
    insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory
    of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior
    monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending
    into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery
    the same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
    of the other!</p>
  <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What shall
    your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they demand
    of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare that
    he bought them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical,
    shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
    his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing
    and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing
    of his wages and thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock
    and bettering his condition in life&#8221;?</p>
