<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mind-time is precious to me. I resent it when random outsiders, trying to
    sell thneeds, get inside my brain. I resent it even more when they get inside
    my children&#8217;s brains. What they claim is free speech, I experience
    as mental trespassing, and so do millions of others. As Kalle Lasn has written, &#8220;Our
    mental environment is a commons like air or water. We need to protect it
    from unwanted incursions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Advertising &#8212; and by this I mean all forms of commercial attention-seeking &#8212; is
    part of the dark side of surplus capitalism. (I say this as one who, during
    my own career, modestly added to the din.) It&#8217;s one of those borderline
    activities that&#8217;s necessary, or at least acceptable, in moderation,
    but becomes dangerous when it spirals out of control. The trouble is that
    advertising escalates inexorably. Every new product needs to announce itself.
    Moreover, the greater the ambient noise, the more each ad has to shout in
    order to be heard. If anything is a &#8220;tragedy of the commons,&#8221; this
    is it (though here, again, the commons is victim, not cause).</p>
  <p>Here are a few statistics that confirm what everyone knows. Children in
    America see, on average, one hundred thousand television ads by age five;
    before they die they&#8217;ll see another two million. In 2002, marketers
    unleashed eighty-seven billion pieces of junk mail, fifty-one billion telemarketing
    calls, and eighty-four billion pieces of email spam. In 2004, a Yankelovich
    poll found that 65 percent of Americans &#8220;feel constantly bombarded
    with too much advertising and marketing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Advertising isn&#8217;t just an occasional trespass of one person against
    another; it&#8217;s a continuous trespass of relatively few corporations
    (the one hundred or so that do the most advertising) against all the rest
    of us. These companies want to &#8212; indeed have to &#8212; increase their
    sales, and for this they need access to our minds. But mind-time is a scarce
    resource. We have only so many hours of it a day, and so many days in our
    lives. Because of this scarcity, every neuro-minute occupied by an ad is
    one less neuro-minute available for our own thoughts and feelings. Every
    ad thus has an opportunity cost, a cost we experience but advertisers don&#8217;t
    pay.</p>
  <p>Ads also have other side effects. They bias us to high-priced branded products,
    to junk foods rather than healthy foods, and to spending rather than saving.
    They diminish our self-esteem by suggesting that we never have enough or
    look good enough. And ultimately, they diminish our natural wealth by increasing
    pollution and depleting resources.</p>
  <p>As individuals, we can do a few things to protect ourselves against ads:
    we can turn off our television, delete email spam, and toss junk mail in
    the recycling bin. But that doesn&#8217;t dampen the collective noise, or
    do much to reduce the external costs of ads. To do that we need economy-wide
    volume controls.</p>
  <p>At present, there are no such controls. Though the airwaves belong to the
    people, no public agency limits TV advertising time. Until 1982, the major
    networks adhered to a voluntary code limiting ads to 9.5 minutes per hour
    in prime time. Then, profit maximizing took over, and the networks dropped
    their code. Today, a typical &#8220;one-hour&#8221; prime-time show has about
    forty-two minutes of content and eighteen minutes of ads and promotions,
    nearly twice the advertising intensity of two decades ago.</p>
  <p>What if we managed advertising as we manage, or could manage, physical pollution?
    If corporations want to pollute our minds, they&#8217;d have to pay for the
    right to do so. As with physical pollution, the transactions could be brokered
    by a trust. This guardian of our inner commons would set caps on total trespasses
    and sell tradeable advertising permits to corporations. Our psychic costs
    would then show up as advertisers&#8217; monetary costs. There&#8217;d be
    less advertising, more peace of mind, and if we so earmarked the revenue,
    more money for commercial-free broadcasting and the arts.</p>
  <p>An advertising cap-and-trade system could have another benefit as well.
            At present, there&#8217;s only one macroeconomic valve for regulating
            the pace of economic activity: the Fed&#8217;s handle on money. If
            the economy is too hot, the Fed raises interest rates; if it&#8217;s
            too cool, the Fed lowers them. The trouble with this valve is that
            it has unpleasant side effects.
            When interest rates go up, so do credit card bills and mortgages,
            and millions of households suffer. But if we dampened an overheated
            economy by lowering
            the volume of advertising, we&#8217;d get the benefits of higher
            interest rates without the pain. In fact, households might save money
            by buying
            less. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
