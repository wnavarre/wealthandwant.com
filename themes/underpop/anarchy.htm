<p>Henry George: <a href="../../HG/SP/02_SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">The
    Increasing Importance of Social Questions</a> (Chapter 1 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social
Problems</a></em></strong>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[11] In a simpler state master and man, neighbor and neighbor, know each
    other, and there is that touch of the elbow which, in times of danger, enables
    society to rally. But present tendencies are to the loss of this. In London,
    dwellers in one house do not know those in the next; the tenants of adjoining
    rooms are utter strangers to each other. Let civil conflict break or paralyze
    the authority that preserves order and the vast population would become a
    terror-stricken mob, without point of rally or principle of cohesion, and
    your London would be sacked and burned by an army of thieves. London is only
    the greatest of great cities. What is true of London is true of New York,
    and in the same measure true of the many cities whose hundreds of thousands
    are steadily growing toward millions. These vast aggregations of humanity,
    where he who seeks isolation may find it more truly than in the desert; where
    wealth and poverty touch and jostle; where one revels and another starves
    within a few feet of each other, yet separated by as great a gulf as that
    fixed between Dives in Hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom &#8212; they are
    centers and types of our civilization. Let jar or shock dislocate the complex
    and delicate organization, let the policeman's club be thrown down or wrested
    from him, and the fountains of the great deep are opened, and quicker than
    ever before chaos comes again. Strong as it may seem, our civilization is
    evolving destructive forces. Not desert and forest, but city slums and country
    roadsides are nursing the barbarians who may be to the new what Hun and Vandal
    were to the old.</p>
  <p>[14] And that the rapid changes now going on are bringing up problems that
    demand most earnest attention may be seen on every hand. Symptoms of danger,
    premonitions of violence, are appearing all over the civilized world. Creeds
    are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces of conservatism are melting
    away. Political institutions are failing, as clearly in democratic America
    as in monarchical Europe. There is growing unrest and bitterness among the
    masses, whatever be the form of government, a blind groping for escape from
    conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute all this to the teachings of
    demagogues is like attributing the fever to the quickened pulse. It is the
    new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles. To put into a sailing-ship
    the powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer would be to tear her
    to pieces with their play. So the new powers rapidly changing all the relations
    of society must shatter social and political organizations not adapted to
    meet their strain.</p>
  <p>[15] To adjust our institutions to growing needs and changing conditions
    is the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism, human sympathy,
    and religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake it. There is danger
    in reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism. The problems
    beginning to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that there is fear they
    may not be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes. But their gravity
    comes from indisposition to recognize frankly and grapple boldly with them.</p>
  <p>[16] These dangers, which menace not one country alone, but modern civilization
    itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling to be born &#8212; that
    the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown conditions and institutions
    that before sufficed.</p>
  <p>[17] A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and
                        power in the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of
                  others mere
                          human machines,
                                  must inevitably
                                      evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But
                      a civilization is possible in which the poorest could have
                      all the comforts
                            and conveniences
                                now
                                  enjoyed by the
                                      rich; in which prisons and almshouses would
                      be needless, and charitable societies unthought of. Such
                      a civilization
                          waits only for
                                the social
                                  intelligence that will adapt means to ends.
                  Powers that
                          might give plenty to all are
                                    already
                                      in our hands. Though there is poverty and
                      want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment from the very
                      excess of
                        wealth-producing
                              forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say
                                      manufacturers, &quot;and we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give
                                      us but work!&quot; cry idle men.</p>
  <p>[19] The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
    be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few, but
    that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political
    economy to college professors. The people themselves must think, because
    the people alone can act. <a href="../../HG/SP/02_SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...
