    Current Doctrine of Wages &#8212; Its Insufficiency</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><B>But the fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly
        grasped, and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed form
        is but an elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and that principles
        obvious in the simpler relations of men are merely disguised and not abrogated
        or reversed by the more intricate relations that result from the division
        of labor and the use of complex tools and methods. The steam grist mill,
        with its complicated machinery exhibiting every diversity of motion, is simply
        what the rude stone mortar dug up from an ancient river bed was in
    its day &#8212; an instrument for grinding corn. And every man engaged in it,
    whether tossing wood into the furnace, running the engine, dressing stones, printing
    sacks or keeping books, is really devoting his labor to the same purpose that
    the prehistoric savage did when be
    used his mortar &#8212; the preparation of grain for human food.</B></p>
  <p>And so, if we reduce to their lowest terms all the complex operations of
    modern production, we see that each individual who takes part in this infinitely
    subdivided
      and intricate network of production and exchange is really doing what the
    primeval man did when he climbed the trees for fruit or followed the receding
    tide for
      shellfish &#8212;<B><I> endeavoring to obtain from nature by the exertion
      of his powers the satisfaction of his desires</I></B>. If we keep this
      firmly in mind, if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as the co-operation
      of all embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various desires
      of each, we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions
      comes as
      truly and as directly from nature as the result of that exertion, as did
      that of the first man.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: in the simplest state of which we can conceive, each man digs
    his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantages of the <B>division
    of labor</B> soon become apparent, and one digs bait while the others fish.
    Yet evidently the one who digs bait is in reality doing as much toward the
    catching of fish as any of those who actually take the fish. So when the advantages
    of canoes are discovered, and instead of all going a-fishing, one stays behind
    and makes and repairs canoes, the canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor
    to the taking of fish as much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he
    eats at night when the fishermen come home are as truly the product of his
    labor as of theirs. And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated,
    and instead of each attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct resort
    to nature, one fishes, another hunts, a third picks berries, a fourth gathers
    fruit, a fifth makes tools, a sixth builds huts, and a seventh prepares clothing
    -- each one is to the extent he exchanges the direct product of his own labor
    for the direct product of the labor of others really applying his own labor
    to the production of the things be uses -- is in effect satisfying his particular
    desires by the exertion of his particular powers; that is to say, what be receives
    be in reality produces. If he digs roots and exchanges them for venison, he
    is in effect as truly the procurer of the venison as though be had gone in
    chase of the deer and left the huntsman to dig his own roots. <B>The common
    expression, "I made so and so," signifying "I earned so and so," or "I earned
    money with which I purchased so and so," is, economically speaking, not metaphorically
    but literally true. Earning is making.</B></p>
  <p>Now, if we follow these principles, obvious enough in a simpler state of society,
    through the complexities of the state we call civilized, we shall see clearly
    that in every case in which labor is exchanged for commodities, production
    really precedes enjoyment; that wages are the earnings &#8212; that is to
    say, the makings of labor &#8212; not the advances of capital, and that
    the laborer who receives
    his wages in money (coined or printed, it may be, before his labor commenced)
    really receives in return for the addition his labor has made to the general
    stock of wealth, a draft upon that general stock, which he may utilize in
    any particular form of wealth that will best satisfy his desires; and that
    neither
    the money, which is but the draft, nor the particular form of wealth which
    he uses it to call for, represents advances of capital for his maintenance,
    but on the contrary represents the wealth, or a portion of the wealth, his
    labor has already added to the general stock.</p>
  <p>Keeping these principles in view we see that </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the draughtsman, who, shut up in some dingy office on the banks of the
          Thames, is drawing the plans for a great marine engine, is in reality
      devoting his labor to the production of bread and meat as truly as though
      he were
          garnering the grain in California or swinging a lariat on a La Plata
      pampa; that he is as truly making his own clothing as though he were shearing
      sheep
          in Australia or weaving cloth in Paisley, and just as effectually producing
          the claret he drinks at dinner as though he gathered the grapes on
      the banks of the Garonne. </li>
    <li>The miner who, two thousand feet under ground in the heart of the Comstock,
          is digging out silver ore, is, in effect, by virtue of a thousand exchanges,
          harvesting crops in valleys five thousand feet nearer the earth's center;
          chasing the whale through Arctic icefields; plucking tobacco leaves
      in Virginia; picking coffee berries in Honduras; cutting sugar cane on
      the Hawaiian Islands;
          gathering cotton in Georgia or weaving it in Manchester or Lowell;
      making quaint wooden toys for his children in the Hartz Mountains; or plucking
      amid
          the green and gold of Los Angeles orchards the oranges which, when
      his shift is relieved, he will take home to his sick wife. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The wages which he receives on Saturday night at the mouth of the shaft, what
    are they but the certificate to all the world that he has done these things
    &#8212; the primary exchange in the long series which transmutes his labor
    into the things he has really been laboring for? ... <a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[08]</font> In the rude beginning, each family produces
    its own food, makes its own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves,
    furnishes its own transportation. Compare with this independence the intricate
    interdependence of the denizens of a modern city. They may supply themselves
    with greater certainty, and in much greater variety and abundance, than the
    savage; but it is by the cooperation of thousands. Even the water they drink,
    and the artificial light they use, are brought to them by elaborate machinery,
    requiring the constant labor and watchfulness of many men. They may travel
    at a speed incredible to the savage; but in doing so resign life and limb
    to the care of others. A broken rail, a drunken engineer, a careless switchman,
    may hurl them to eternity. And the power of applying labor to the satisfaction
    of desire passes, in the same way, beyond the direct control of the individual.
    The laborer becomes but part of a great machine, which may at any time be
    paralyzed by causes beyond his power, or even his foresight. Thus does the
    well-being of each become more and more dependent upon the well-being of
    all &#8212; the individual more and more subordinate to society.</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2">[09]</font> And so come new dangers. The
    rude society resembles the creatures that though cut into pieces will live;
    the highly civilized society is like a highly organized animal: a stab in
    a vital part, the suppression of a single function, is death. A savage village
    may be burned and its people driven off &#8212; but, used to direct recourse
    to nature, they can maintain themselves. <strong>Highly civilized man, however,
    accustomed to capital, to machinery, to the minute division of labor, becomes
    helpless
    when suddenly deprived of these and thrown upon nature. </strong>Under the
    factory system, some sixty persons, with the aid of much costly machinery,
    cooperate
    to the making of a pair of shoes. But, of the sixty, not one could make a
    whole shoe. This is the tendency in all branches of production, even in agriculture.
    How many farmers of the new generation can use the flail? How many farmers'
    wives can now make a coat from the wool? Many of our farmers do not even
    make their own butter or raise their own vegetables! There is an enormous
    gain in productive power from this division of labor, which assigns to the
    individual the production of but a few of the things, or even but a small
    part of one of the things, he needs, and makes each dependent upon others
    with whom he never comes in contact; but the social organization becomes
    more sensitive. A primitive village community may pursue the even tenor of
    its life without feeling disasters which overtake other villages but a few
    miles off; but in the closely knit civilization to which we have attained,
    a war, a scarcity, a commercial crisis, in one hemisphere produces powerful
    effects in the other, while shocks and jars from which a primitive community
    easily recovers would to a highly civilized community mean wreck. <a href="../../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. <strong>In our cities of millions and our states of scores of
    millions, in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that
    large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed.</strong> But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "Greater Leviathan<a name="GreaterLeviathan"></a>" </span><br>
    <br>
THE famous treatise in which the English philosopher Hobbes, during the revolt
against the tyranny of the Stuarts in the seventeenth century, sought to give
the sanction of reason to the doctrine of the absolute authority of kings, is
entitled <em>Leviathan</em>. It thus begins: "Nature, the art whereby God hath
made and governs the world, is by the art of man, as in many other things, so
in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal. . . For by art
is created that great Leviathan called a commonwealth or state, in Latin <span style="font-style: italic;">civitas</span>,
which is but an artificial man; though of greater stature and strength than the
natural, for whose protection and defense it was intended. . ." <br>
          <br>
Without stopping now to comment further on Hobbes's suggestive analogy, there
is, it seems to me, in the system or arrangement into which men are brought in
social life by the effort to satisfy their material desires &#8212; an integration
which goes on as civilization advances &#8212; something which even more strongly
and more clearly suggests the idea of a gigantic man, formed by the union of
individual men, than any merely political integration. This Greater Leviathan
is to the political structure or conscious commonwealth what the unconscious
functions of the body are to the conscious activities. It is not made by pact
or covenant, it grows; as the tree grows, as the man himself grows, by virtue
of natural laws inherent in human nature and in the constitution of things. .
. . It is this natural system or arrangement, this adjustment of means to ends,
of the parts to the whole and the whole to the parts, in the satisfaction of
the material desires of men living in society, which, in the same sense as that
in which we speak of the economy of the solar system, is the economy of human
society, or what in English we call political economy. It is as human units,
individuals or families, take their place as integers of this higher man, this
Greater Leviathan, that what we call civilization begins and advances. . . .
The appearance and development of the body politic, the organized state, the
Leviathan of Hobbes, is the mark of civilization already in existence. &#8212; <em>The

  <p><strong><font size="-1">2. THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
  <p>When considered in connection with primitive modes of production, the vital
    importance of this truth is self-evident. 55 If those modes prevailed, involuntary
    poverty would be readily traced either to direct enslavement through ownership
    of Labor, or to indirect enslavement through ownership of Land. 56 There
    could be no other cause. If both causes were absent, every individual might,
    if he wished, enjoy all the Wealth that his own powers were capable of producing
    in 'the primitive modes of production and under the limitations of common
    knowledge that belonged to his environment.57</p>
  <p>But in the civilized state this principle is so entangled in the complexities
    of division of labor and trade as to be almost lost in the maze. Many, even
    of those who recognize it, fail to grasp it as a fundamental truth. Yet it
    is no less vital in civilized than in primitive modes of production.</p>
  <p><strong><em>a. Division of Labor</em></strong></p>
  <p>The essential difference between primitive and civilized modes of production
    is not in the accumulation of capital which characterizes the latter, but
    in the greater scope and minuteness of its division of labor.58 Capital is
    an effect of division of labor rather than a cause. Division of labor, by
    enhancing labor power and relieving man from the perpetual pursuit of mere
    subsistence, utilizes capital and makes civilization possible.59</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">58. It is his failure to realize this that accounts for the theory of the
        socialist that laborers in the civilized state are dependent upon accumulated
        capital as well as upon land for opportunities to produce. See ante, note
        49, and post, note 81.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">59. Here are two men at a given point. Each has an errand to do a mile to
        the east, and each has one to do a mile to the west. If each goes upon his
        own errand each will travel a mile out and a mile back in one direction and
        the same in the other, making four miles' travel apiece, or eight miles in
        all. But if one does both errands to the east and the other does both to
        the west, they will travel but two miles apiece, or four in all. By division
        of labor they free half their energy and half their time for devotion to
        other work, or to study, or to play, as their inclinations dictate.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The productive power of division of labor may be illustrated by considering
    it as a means for utilizing differences of soil and climate. If, for example,
    the soil and the climate of two sections of a country, or of two different
    countries (for the effects of division of labor are not dependent upon political
    geography 60), differ inversely, one being better adapted to the production
    of corn than of sugar, and the other, on the contrary, being better adapted
    to the production of sugar than of corn, they will yield more wealth in corn
    and sugar with division of labor than without it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6o. No more than are the effects of a healthful climate.
        Protectionists who argue that there should be free trade between villages,
        cities, counties
        and states in the same nation, but protection for nations, thus making
      the effect of trade to depend upon the invisible political boundary line
      that
        separates communities, are like the colored woman who, when her house,
      without being physically removed, had been politically shifted from North
      Carolina
        to Virginia by a change of the boundary line, expressed her satisfaction
        in the remark that she was very glad of it, because she &quot;allus yearn

        glad that she didn't &quot;live dyeah no me'!&quot;</font></p>

  <p>Let us imagine a Mainland and an Island, which, as to the adaptability of
    their soil and climate to the production of corn and sugar, so differ that
    if the people of each should raise their own corn and their own sugar they
    would produce, with a given unit of labor force, but 22 of Wealth &#8212; 11
    in corn and 11 in sugar. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Production in that manner would ignore the opportunities afforded by nature
    to man for utilizing differences of soil and climate; but by such a wise
    division as Labor would adopt in similar circumstances, if unrestrained,
    the same unit of labor force almost doubles the product. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Nor is it alone because it utilizes differences of soil and climate that
    division of labor is so effective. Its effectiveness is enhanced in still
    higher degree by its lessening of the labor force necessary to accomplish
    any industrial result, whether in mining, manufacturing, transporting, store-keeping,
    professional employments, agriculture, or the incidental occupations. Minute
    division of labor, instead of accounting for poverty in the civilized state,
    makes it all the more unaccountable. ...</p>
  <p><strong><em>b. Trade</em></strong></p>
  <p>But division of labor is dependent upon trade. If trade were wholly stopped
    there would be no division of labor; 61 if it be interfered with, division
    of labor is obstructed. 62 In the last preceding chart, which illustrates
    the effect of division of labor without trade, the Mainland gets 20 of corn,
    but no sugar, and the Island gets 20 of sugar, but no corn. Yet each wants
    both sugar and corn; and if they freely trade, their wants in these respects
    will be better satisfied than if each raises its own corn and sugar.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">61. Men who devoted themselves to specialties, unable
        to exchange their products for the objects of their desire, which alone
        would be the motive for their special labor, would abandon specialties
        and resort to less civilized methods of supplying their wants.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">62. Division of labor, whether adopted to take advantage
        of the different varieties of land or to secure the benefits of special
        skill in labor, cannot continue without trade; and to the degree that
        trade is impeded, to that degree division of labor will languish. It
        is only under absolute free trade between all people and in respect of
        all products that division of labor can flourish. Any interference with
        it is economically an enslavement of labor in a degree proportioned to
        the degree of interference.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Compare the first chart of this series with the following: 63 [chart]</p>
  <p>The comparison 64 illustrates the advantage to each individual, community
    and country, of division of labor and trade over more primitive modes of
    production. It is like the difference between raising weights by direct application
    of power, and by means of block and tackle.65</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">63. It will be seen from this chart that the people of
        the two places, by dividing their given expenditure of labor in such
        a manner as to utilize the natural advantage peculiar to each place,
        secure a clear profit of 18. And this is a substantial profit, consisting
        not merely of figures upon paper, but of real wealth &#8212; artificial
        external objects which serve to satisfy human desires.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">64. The people of the Mainland have now sent 10 of their
        corn to the Island, and the people of the Island have paid for it by
        sending 10 of their sugar to the Mainland.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For simplicity. the cost of effecting the trade is omitted.
        It does not affect the principle. If the cost were so high that more
        sugar and corn could be got without division of labor than with, division
        of labor would be abandoned as unprofitable; if low enough to admit of
        any profit at all, the trading would go on, unless restrained, precisely
        as if it involved no cost. It may be well to state, however, that the
        nearer we get to no cost in trading, the better are we off. Hence, any
        tariff on trading, whether domestic or foreign, like railroad and shipping
        rates for freight, is prejudicial; for tariffs add to the cost of trading
        just as freight rates do. Protection has that for its object. When it
        does not add enough to the price of a foreign product to prevent importation
        it fails of its purpose. And though revenue tariffs have no such object
        they produce the same effect, only in minor degree.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">65. If every man were obliged, unassisted by the co-operation
        of others, to supply his own needs directly by his own labor, few could
        more than meagerly satisfy even the simplest of those desires which we
        have in common with lower animals. Though each labored diligently the
        aggregate of wealth would be exceedingly small compared with the necessities
        of those who wished to consume it, while in variety it would be very
        limited and in quality of the poorest kind. But by division of labor,
        which has been carried to marvelous lengths and is still developing,
        productive power is so enormously increased that the annual wealth products
        of the present time, in quantity and quality, in variety, usefulness
        and beauty, almost appear to be the work of giants and fairies.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And what this series of charts illustrates regarding two places and two
    forms of wealth, is true in principle of all places and all forms of wealth.
    That every one is better served when each does for others what relatively
    he does best, in exchange for what relatively they do best, is as true of
    communities and nations as it is of individuals. Indeed, it is true of communities
    and nations because it is true of individuals; for it is individuals that
    trade, and not communities or nations as such.66</p>

    <p><font size="-1">66. Mankind as a whole may be likened to a great man,
        with eyes to see, brain to invent and direct, nerves for intercommunication,
        and various muscles for various actions. As different parts of the bodies
        of men do different things, each part contributing co-operatively to
        a general result, so it is with the body politic, whose different parts &#8212; individual
        men &#8212; contribute in different ways to the common good. Trade is
        to the body politic what digestion is to the physical body. To prohibit
        it is to deprive the great man of his stomach; to restrict it is to give
        him dyspepsia.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Says Emerson in the &quot;American Scholar,&quot; an oration
        delivered at Cambridge in 1837: &quot;It is one of those fables which
        out of an unknown antiquity convey an unlocked-for wisdom, that the gods,
        in the beginning, divided man into men, that he might be more helpful
        to himself; just as the hand was divided into fingers, the better to
        answer its ends.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Reflection upon the labor-saving power of trade makes
        it clear that the notion of protectionists that free trade is prejudicial
        to home industry has no foundation. It would interfere with &quot;home
        industries&quot; that could be better conducted elsewhere; but by that
        very fact it would strengthen the industries that belonged at home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">When we decide to buy foreign goods we do not thereby
        decide to employ foreign labor instead of American labor; we decide that
        the American labor shall be employed in making things to trade for what
        we buy, instead of making the things that we buy. And we get a better
        net result or we wouldn't do it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Free trade and labor-saving machinery, which belong in
        the same industrial category, increase the aggregate wealth of the country
        where they flourish. Whether or not they tend to impoverish individuals
        or classes, depends upon the manner in which the increased wealth is
        distributed. If they do so tend, the remedy surely does not lie in the
        direction of obstructing trade and smashing machines so that less wealth
        may be produced with given labor, but in altering the conditions that
        promote unjust distribution.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. The Law of Division of Labor and Trade</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is it that leads men to conform their conduct to the principle
    illustrated by the last chart? Why do they divide their labor, and trade
    its products? A simple, universal and familiar law of human nature moves
    them. Whether men be isolated, or be living in primitive communities, or
    in advanced states of civilization, their demand for consumption determines
    the direction of Labor in production.67 That is the law. Considered in connection
    with a solitary individual, like Robinson Crusoe upon his island, it is obvious.
    What he demanded for consumption he was obliged to produce. Even as to the
    goods he collected from stranded ships &#8212; desiring to consume them,
    he was obliged to labor to produce them to places of safety. His demand for
    consumption always determined the direction of his labor in production.68
    And when we remember that what Robinson Crusoe was to his island in the sea,
    civilized man as a whole is to this island in space, we may readily understand
    the application of the same simple law to the great body of labor in the
    civilized world.69 Nevertheless, the complexities of civilized life are so
    likely to obscure its operation and disguise its relations to social questions
    like that of the persistence of poverty as to make illustration desirable.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">67. The term &quot; production&quot; means not creation
        but adaptation. Man cannot add an atom to the universe of matter; but
        he can so modify the condition of matter, both in respect of form and
        of place, as to adapt it to the satisfaction of human desires. To do
        this is to produce wealth.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Consumption&quot; is the ultimate object of all
        production. We produce because we desire to consume. But consumption
        does not mean destruction. Man has no more power to destroy than to create.
        His power in consumption, like his power in production, is limited to
        changing the condition of things. As by production man changes things
        from natural to artificial conditions to satisfy his desires, so by consumption
        he changes things from artificial to natural conditions in the process
        of satisfying his desires.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Production is the drawing forth of desired things, of
        Wealth, from the Land; consumption is the returning back of those things
        to the Land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;All labor is but the movement of particles of matter
        from one place to another.&quot; &#8212; Dick's Outlines, p. 25.</font></p>

        so he destroys no matter, but only utilities. Consumption means the destruction
        of a utility.&quot; &#8212; Ely's Intro., part v. ch. i., p. 268.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Production means &quot;drawing forth.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 17.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Man cannot create material things. . . His efforts
        and sacrifices result in changing the form or arrangement of matter to

        Prin., book ii, ch. iii, sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is sometimes said that traders do not produce;
        that while the cabinet maker produces furniture, the furniture dealer
        merely sells what is already produced. But there is no scientific foundation
        for this distinction.&quot; &#8212; Id.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;As his [man's] production of material products is
        really nothing more than a rearrangement of matter which gives it new
        utilities, so his consumption of them is nothing more than a disarrangement
        of matter which diminishes or destroys its utilities.&quot; &#8212; Id.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;In like manner as by production is meant the creation
        not of substance but of utility, so by consumption is meant the destruction
        of utility and not of substance or matter.&quot; &#8212; Say's Trea.,
        book ii, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;All that man can do is to reproduce existing materials
        under another form, which may give them a utility they did not before
        possess, or merely enlarge one they may have before presented. So that
        in fact there is a creation not of matter but of utility ; and this I
        call production of wealth. . . There is no actual production of wealth
        without a creation or augmentation of utility.&quot;&#8212; Say's Trea.,
        book i, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">68. It is highly significant that while Robinson Crusoe
        had unsatisfied wants he was never out of a job.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">69. Demand for consumption is satisfied not from hoards
        of accumulated wealth, but from the stream of current production. Broadly
        speaking there can be no accumulation of wealth in the sense of saving
        up wealth from generation to generation. Imagine a man's satisfying his
        demand for eggs from the accumulated stores of his ancestors! Yet eggs
        do not differ in this respect from other forms of wealth, except that
        some other forms will keep a little longer, and some not so long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The notion that a saving instinct must be aroused before
        the great and more lasting forms of wealth can be brought forth is a
        mistake. Houses and locomotives, for example, are built not because of
        any desire to accumulate wealth, but because we need houses to live in
        and locomotives to transport us and our goods. It is not the saving,
        but the serving, instinct that induces the production of these things;
        the same instinct that induces the production of a loaf of bread.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Artificial things do not save. No sooner are the processes
        of production from land complete than the products are on their way back
        to the land. If man does not return them by means of consumption, then
        through decay they return themselves. Mankind as a whole lives literally
        from hand to mouth. What is demanded for consumption in the present must
        be produced by the labor of the present. From current production, and
        from that alone, can current consumption be satisfied.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Accumulated wealth&quot; is, in fact, not wealth
        at all in any great degree. It is merely titles to wealth yet to be produced.
        A share in a mining company, for example, is but a certificate that the
        owner is legally entitled to a proportion of the wealth to be produced
        in the future from a certain mine.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Titles to future wealth may be both morally and legally
        valid. This is so when they represent past labor or its products loaned
        in free contract for future labor or its products; for example, a contract
        for the delivery of goods of any kind today to be paid for next week
        or next month, or next year, or in ten years, or later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">They may be legally but not morally valid. This is so
        when they represent the product of a franchise (whether paid for in labor
        or not) to exact tribute from future labor; for example, a franchise
        to confiscate a man's labor through ownership of his body, as in slavery,
        or a franchise to confiscate the products of labor in general through
        ownership of land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Or they may be both legally and morally invalid, as when
        they are obtained by illegal force or fraud from the rightful owner. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The poverty of Food-makers as to clothing is thus removed. They are working
    all they care to at food-making, their own chosen employment, and they are
    paid in clothing, their own chosen compensation. So long as Personal Servants
    withdraw food and Clothing-makers supply clothing, Food-makers cannot be
    poor. With them business will be brisk, labor will be in demand, and wages
    will be high. That all the other workers may enjoy the same prosperity we
    shall see in a moment. Clothing-makers pour clothing into the commercial
    reservoir because they wish to take something out, and know that in this
    way they can get a larger quantity and better quality of what they require
    than if they undertake to make it themselves. They are skilled in making
    clothing; they are not skilled in other ways. Accordingly they utilize the
    claim against Personal Servants, which has passed to their credit in exchange
    for clothing, by drawing from the commercial reservoir the particular commodity
    they desire. Suppose it to be shelter. They proceed as Personal Servants
    and Food-makers have already done, and so set Shelter-makers at work. Shelter-makers
    in turn utilize the claim against Personal Servants which has now been credited
    to them, by taking luxuries out of the reservoir. This sets Luxury-makers
    at work. Luxury-makers then pass the claim over in exchange for services,
    and Personal Servants redeem it by rendering such services as Luxury-makers
    demand.72 Everybody is now paid for his own products with the products of
    others; and by demanding more food, Personal Servants may perpetuate the
    interchange indefinitely.73 And Personal Servants will continue to demand
    more food until their wants as to food are wholly and finally satisfied.74</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">72. The mechanism of these exchanges should be explained.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Personal Servants upon demanding food may pay money for it. The retailers
        might thereupon pass the money along, and it would ultimately return to Personal
        Servants. Or the Personal Servants may give notes payable at a future time,
        which being endorsed over would at last be redeemed by them in services.
        Or they may give checks on banks, which assumes previous work done by them
        or the discounting of their notes by the banks. As the world's exchanges
        are almost wholly adjusted by means of checks, and other commercial paper
        which is in economic effect the same as checks, let us illustrate that mode
        by a series of charts adapted from Jevons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">We will begin with two traders, A and B. They have no
        money, but every time that one demands anything of the other he must
        offer in exchange something
        that the other wants. There must be what is called &quot;a double coincidence&quot; of
        demand and supply; each must want what the other has. This is primitive
        barter. It may be represented by the following chart :</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In the civilized state, even in its beginnings, primitive
        barter must be obstructive to trade, and it gives way to the use of currency &#8212; some
        common medium which is taken for goods not because the taker wants it
      but because he knows that be can readily exchange it for the goods that
      he does
        want. With currency in use, when A wants anything of B he is not obliged
        to find something that B wants. All he needs is currency. Thus currency
      reduces the friction of trading.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But as the volume of trade augments, demand for currency increases; and
        because it is scarce, or troublesome or dangerous to transmit, or all together,
        easier means of exchange are resorted to, and bookkeeping takes the place
        of currency as currency took the place of primitive barter. At this stage,
        when A wants anything of B, B charges him; and when B wants anything of A,
        A charges him. Their mutual accounts being adjusted, the small balance is
        paid with currency. Thus the demand for currency is greatly lowered by bookkeeping,
        and the friction of trading is correspondingly reduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now let us bring in two more traders, C and D:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Though all four of these traders keep mutual accounts,
        the settlement of balances requires more currency than before, and scarcity
        of currency,
      together
        with the danger and expense of transmission, evolves an extension of
      bookkeeping. A common bookkeeper, called a &quot;Bank,&quot; is employed,
      and all need for currency disappears:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Balances are now settled by checks, and all accounts are adjusted in the
        central ledger at the bank.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But the introduction of another group of traders, another community, renews
        the demand for currency, and another bank appears. Thus:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And now the two banks are in the same position that A and B were in before
        any bank came. They keep mutual accounts, but they must have currency to
        settle their balances. And if we bring in more communities the demand for
        currency further increases. Thus:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now the four banks are in the same situation that A, B,
        C and D were in before there were any banks. This evolves a bank of banks &#8212; a
        clearing-house.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">All necessity for currency once more disappears.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">These charts illustrate the principle by which mutual trading is effected.
        In practice, the need of currency is never wholly done away with, but the
        tendency is constantly in the direction of doing away with it. And it is
        said that over ninety per cent of the trading transactions of the world are
        adjusted in this manner, and less than ten per cent by means of currency.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The clearing-house principle extends over the civilized world. In illustration
        of this, observe the following chart:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"><br>
        These five cities are like the five banks. The bookkeeping of each city is
          conducted by local banks and clearing-houses, and the central bookkeeping
          by those of the market town of the world, which at present is London.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In this way the mobility of labor is in effect enormously increased. Labor
        in every corner of the world is brought into close trading relations with
        labor everywhere else, so that only war, pestilence, protection, and land
        monopoly interfere with the full freedom of its movement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">73. Personal Servants, on the basis of their employment by Luxury-makers,
        demand more food, which keeps Food-makers at work; Food-makers demand more
        clothing, which keeps Clothing-makers at work; Clothing-makers demand more
        shelter, which keeps Shelter-makers at work; Shelter-makers demand more luxuries,
        which keeps Luxury-makers at work; Luxury-makers demand more services, which
        keeps Personal Servants at work. And so on indefinitely.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">If now we add progressive invention, so that every one
        produces more and more wealth with less and less labor, instead of finding
        poverty upon
      the increase, instead of being harried by periodical &quot;hard times,&quot; we
        shall find business brisk and every one becoming richer and richer. That
        is to say, though all labor less than before, each obtains better results
        from others while giving better results in exchange.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And should we improve the verisimilitude of the illustration
        by bringing in the fact that all workers in civilized society are specialists
        in
      a much more minute degree than the division into Clothing-makers, Food-makers,
      etc.,
        would imply &#8212; that every one who works does over and over some one
        thing in one of these branches, as the making of shoes or the baking of bread,
        or even only part of a thing, as the cutting of shoe soles, and that while
        giving out a great deal of his own product he demands in pay a little of
        every other kind of product &#8212; the same effect would naturally result.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Every man who demands anything for consumption thereby
        determines the direction of labor toward the production not only of that
        thing, but also
      of all the
        artificial materials and implements, from the simplest tool to the most
      expensive and complex machine, that are used in its production. The actual
      process
        is much more intricate than that of the charts, but the charts illustrate
        the principle so that any intelligent person who understands them can
      apply &#8212; it
        to the most complex affairs of industrial life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This principle is so simple and obvious that it needs no further illustration,
        yet in its light all the complexities of our subject disappear, and we thus
        reach the same view of the real objects and rewards of labor in the intricacies
        of modern production that we rained by observing in the first beginnings
        of society the simpler forms of production and exchange. We see that now,
        as then, each laborer is endeavoring to obtain by his exertions the satisfaction
        of his own desires; we see that although the minute division of labor assigns
        to each producer the production of but a small part, or perhaps nothing at
        all, of the particular things he labors to get, yet, in aiding in the production
        of what other producers want, he is directing other labor to the production
        of the things he wants &#8212; in effect, producing them himself. And thus,
        if he makes jackknives and eats wheat, the wheat is really as much the produce
        of his labor as if he had grown it for himself and left wheat-growers to
        make their own jackknives.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty. book i,

        clothes, he seeks not merely comfort, but adornment; the rude shelter becomes

  <p>Let us now complete this chart. When we began it a distinction was noted
          between Personal Servants, who render mere intangible services, and the other
          classes, who produce tangible wealth. But essentially there is no difference.
          By referring to the chart and observing the course of the arrows, Food-makers
          are seen working for Personal Servants precisely as Personal Servants work
          for Luxury-makers. We may therefore abandon the distinction. This makes it
          no longer necessary to mention particular classes of products in the chart;
          it is enough to distinguish the different kinds of labor.76 Thus:</p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p>For simplicity the workers have been divided into great classes, and each
    class has been supposed to serve only one other class. But the actual currents
    of trade are much more complex. It would be practically impossible to follow
    them in detail, or to illustrate their particular movements in any simple
    way. And it is unnecessary. The principle illustrated in the chart is the
    principle of all division of labor and trade, however minute the details
    and intricate the movement; and any person of ordinary intelligence who wishes
    to understand will need only to grasp the principle as illustrated by the
    chart to be able to apply it to the experiences of everyday industrial life.
    All legitimate trade is the interchange of Labor for Labor.77</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">77. In the light of this principle how absurd are some of the explanations
        of hard times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Overproduction! when an infinite variety of wants are
        unsatisfied which those who are in want are anxious and able to satisfy
        for one another.
      Hatters want bread, and bakers want hats, and farmers want both, and they
      all want
        machines, and machinists want bread and hats and machines, and so on
      without end. Yet while men are against their will in partial or complete
      idleness,
        their wants go unsatisfied! Since producers are also consumers, and production
        is governed by demand for consumption, there can be no real overproduction
        until demand ceases. The apparent overproduction which we see &#8212; overproduction
        relatively to &quot;effective demand&quot; &#8212; is in fact a congestion
        of some things due to an abnormal underproduction of other things, the
        underproduction being caused by obstructions in the way of labor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Scarcity of capital! when makers of capital in all its forms are involuntarily
        idle. Scarcity of capital, like scarcity of money, is only an expression
        for lack of employment. But why should there be any lack of employment while
        men have unsatisfied wants which they can reciprocally satisfy?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Too much competition! when competition and freedom are the same. It is not
        freedom but restraint, not competition but protection, that obstructs the
        action and reaction of demand and supply which we have illustrated in the
        chart.</font></p>

  <p><strong><em>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
    assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more productive.93
    Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition that social
    growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure of labor force
    as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied to the second, to
    50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as
    applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for
    land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon the
        distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways: First, By
        lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing out in land special
        capabilities otherwise latent, and by attaching special capabilities
        to particular lands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode, to
        which little attention has been given by political economists, is really
        the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch.
        iii.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks off
        land from those material things which we regard as products of the land,
        we shall find that the fundamental attribute of land is its extension.
        The right to use a piece of land gives command over a certain space &#8212; a
        certain part of the earth's surface. The area of the earth is fixed;
        the geometric relations in which any particular part of it stands to
        other parts are fixed. Man has no control over them; they are wholly
        unaffected by demand; they have no cost of production; there is no supply
        price at which they can be produced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface
        is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it gives him room
        for his own actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the light, the
        air and the rain which nature assigns to that area; and it determines
        his distance from, and in great measure his relations to, other things
        and other persons. We shall find that it is this property of land, which,
        though as yet insufficient prominence has been given to it, is the ultimate
        cause of the distinction which all writers are compelled to make between
        land and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book iv, ch. ii,
        sec. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this regular
        way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are intended to illustrate
        the universal fact that as any land becomes a center of trade or other
        social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
    But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of labor
    increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages (as a proportion
    of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward, while that of Rent
    is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by observation. 96</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader,
        before closing this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that
        I am using the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in the
        sense of a proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises, I do
        not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers as wages is
        necessarily less, but that the proportion which it bears to the whole
        produce is necessarily less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity
        remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book
        iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would
        be the result of social growth if all land but that which was in full
        use were common land. The discovery of mines, the development of cities
        and towns, and the construction of railroads, the irrigation of and places,
        improvements in government, all the infinite conveniences and laborsaving
        devices that civilization generates, would tend to abolish poverty by
        increasing the compensation of labor, and making it impossible for any
        man to be in involuntary idleness, or underpaid, so long as mankind was
        in want. If demand for land increased, Wages would tend to fall as the
        demand brought lower grades of land into use; but they would at the same
        time tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower
        grades. And it is altogether probable that, while progress would lower
        Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase them as an
        absolute quantity.... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each
    member is capable of an independent life. He can build his own habitation,
    hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own clothing, manufacture
    his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments. He has all the knowledge of
    nature possessed by his tribe &#8212; knows what vegetable productions are
    fit for food, and where they maybe found; knows the habits and resorts of
    beasts, birds, fishes and insects; can pilot himself by the sun or the stars,
    by the turning of blossoms or the mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable
    of supplying all his wants. He may be cut off from his fellows and still
    live; and thus possesses an independent power which makes him a free contracting
    party in his relations to the community of which he is a member.</p>
  <p>Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized society,
    whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but the infinitesimal
    part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of things that constitute the
    wealth of society and go to supply even the most primitive wants; who not
    only cannot make even the tools required for his work, but often works with
    tools that he does not own, and can never hope to own. Compelled to even
    closer and more continuous labor than the savage, and gaining by it no more
    than the savage gets &#8212; the mere necessaries of life &#8212; he loses
    the independence of the savage. He is not only unable to apply his own powers
    to the direct satisfaction of his own wants, but, without the concurrence
    of many others, he is unable to apply them indirectly to the satisfaction
    of his wants. He is a mere link in an enormous chain of producers and consumers,
    helpless to separate himself, and helpless to move, except as they move.
    The worse his position in society, the more dependent is he on society; the
    more utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself. The very power
    of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes from his own
    control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions of others, or by
    general causes over which he has no more influence than he has over the motions
    of the solar system. The primeval curse comes to be looked upon as a boon,
    and men think, and talk, and clamor, and legislate as though monotonous manual
    labor in itself were a good and not an evil, an end and not a means. Under
    such circumstances, the man loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the
    godlike power of modifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave,
    a machine, a commodity &#8212; a thing, in some respects, lower than the
    animal.</p>
  <p>I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas of
    the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or Cooper.
    I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low and narrow
    range. I believe that civilization is not only the natural destiny of man,
    but the enfranchisement, elevation, and refinement of all his powers, and
    think that it is only in such moods as may lead him to envy the cud-chewing
    cattle, that a man who is free to the advantages of civilization could look
    with regret upon the savage state. But, nevertheless, I think no one who
    will open his eyes to the facts, can resist the conclusion that there are
    in the heart of our civilization large classes with whom the veriest savage
    could not afford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if, standing
    on the threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering life as
    a Terra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in the Arctic
    Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized country as
    Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in selecting the
    lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of wealth are condemned
    to want, suffer all the privations of the savage, without his sense of personal
    freedom; they are condemned to more than his narrowness and littleness, without
    opportunity for the growth of his rude virtues; if their horizon is wider,
    it is but to reveal blessings that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

  <p> DOES not the fact that all of the things which furnish man's subsistence
    have the power to multiply many fold &#8212; some of them many thousand fold,
    and some of them many million or even billion fold &#8212; while he is only
    doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings increase to the full extent
    of their reproductive power, the increase of population can never exceed
    subsistence? This is clear when it is remembered that though in the vegetable
    and animal kingdoms each species, by virtue of its reproductive power, naturally
    and necessarily presses against the conditions which limit its further increase,
    yet these conditions are nowhere fixed and final. No species reaches the
    ultimate limit of soil, water, air, and sunshine; but the actual limit of
    each is in the existence of other species, its rivals, its enemies, or its
    food. Thus the conditions which limit the existence of such of these species
    as afford him subsistence man can extend (in some cases his mere appearance
    will extend them), and thus the reproductive forces of the species which
    supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves against their former limit,
    start forward in his service at a pace which his powers of increase cannot
    rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds will increase: if he but trap foxes
    the wild rabbits will multiply; the bumble bee moves with the pioneer, and
    on the organic matter with which man's presence fills the rivers, fishes
    feed. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II, Chapter 3: Population

  <p>IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North American

    of bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the reverse.
    But within the limits of the United States alone, there are now forty-five
    millions of men where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet
    there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five
    millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. It is not the
    increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of
    men that has brought about the increase of food. There is more food, simply
    because there are more Man. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,

  <p>TWENTY men working together will, where nature is niggardly, produce more
    than twenty times the wealth that one man can produce where nature is most
    bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the subdivision
    of labor, the greater the economies of production and distribution, and,
    hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the
    limits in which we have any reason to suppose increase would still go on,
    in any given state of civilization a greater number of people can produce
    a larger proportionate amount of wealth and more fully supply their wants,
    than can a smaller number. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,

  <p> CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; The Science of Political Economy unabridged: Book
    III, Chapter 17, The Production of Wealth: The Third Factor of Production &#8212; Capital &#8226; abridged:
    Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</p>
  <p>IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always
    a subsidiary, never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always
    labor. That is to say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital,
    is never used by capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the
    term capital we mean the thing capital. It is also true when we personify
    the term and mean by it not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed
    of capital. The capitalist pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital,
    has in his hands the power of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist
    he cannot exercise that power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize
    it he must himself exercise at least some of the functions of labor, or he
    must put his capital, on some terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; The
    Science of Political Economy unabridged: Book III, Chapter 17, The Production
    of Wealth: The Third Factor of Production &#8212; Capital &#8226; abridged:
    Part III, Chapter 10: Order of the Three Factors of Production</p>
  <p>THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be
    included either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which
    are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these
    two original factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that
    does not consist of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital
    that is not wealth. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter
    2: Wages and Capital: The Meaning of the Terms</p>
  <p>THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative
    of capital. The capital that was once received for it by the government has
    been consumed unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon,
    used up in war ships, expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing
    and destroying. The bond cannot represent capital that has been destroyed.
    It does not represent capital at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that
    the government will, some time or other, take by taxation from the then existing
    stock of the people, so much wealth, which it will turn over to the holder
    of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile, it will, from time to time, take,
    in the same way, enough to make up to the holder the increase which so much
    capital as it some day promises to give him would yield him were it actually
    in his possession. The immense sums which are thus taken from the produce
    of every modern country to pay interest on public debts are not the earnings
    or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in the strict sense
    of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and capital, leaving
    so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    III, Chapter 4: The Laws of Distribution: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits
    Often Mistaken For Interest</p>
  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange.</p>
  <p>Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1)
    By enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up
    clams with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal
    into a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail
    itself of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing
    it, or animals by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor,
    and thus, on the one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor
    of wealth, by the utilization of special capabilities, the acquisition of
    skill, and the reduction of waste; and, on the other, calling in the powers
    of the natural factor at their highest, by taking advantage of the diversities
    of soil, climate and situation, so as to obtain each particular species of
    wealth where nature is most favorable to its production.</p>
  <p>Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth,
    as is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature.
    But such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are
    capital. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter 5: Wages
    and Capital: The Real Functions of Capital</p>
  <p>THE laborer who receives his wages in money (coined or printed, it may be,
    before his labor commenced) really receives in return for the addition his
    labor has made to the general stock of wealth, a draft upon that general
    stock, which he may utilize in any particular form of wealth that will best
    satisfy his desires; and neither the money, which is but the draft, nor the
    particular form of wealth which he uses it to call for, represents advances
    of capital for his maintenance, but on the contrary represents the wealth,
    or a portion of the wealth, his labor has already added to the general stock. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

    is relieved, he will take home to his sick wife. The wages which he receives
    on Saturday night at the mouth of the shaft, what are they but the certificate
    to all the world that he has done these things &#8212; the primary exchange

    been laboring for? &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter
    1: Wages and Capital: The Current Doctrine of Wages &#8212; Its Insufficiency</p>
  <p>LABOR always precedes wages. This is as universally true of wages received
    by the laborer from an employer as it is of wages taken directly by the laborer
    who is his own employee. In the one class of cases as in the other, reward
    is conditioned upon exertion. Paid sometimes by the day, oftener by the week
    or month, occasionally by the year, and in many branches of production by
    the piece, the payment of wages by an employer to an employee always implies
    the previous rendering of labor by the employee for the benefit of the employer,
    for the few cases in which advance payments are made for personal services
    are evidently referable either to charity or to guarantee and purchase. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

      <br>
      THE payment of wages always implies the previous rendering of labor. Now,
      what does the rendering of labor in production imply? Evidently the production
      of wealth, which, if it is to be exchanged or used in production, is capital.
      Therefore, the payment of capital in wages pre-supposes a production of
      capital by the labor for which the wages are paid. And as the employer
      generally makes a profit, the payment of wages is, so far as he is concerned,
      but the return to the laborer of a portion of the capital he has received
      from the labor. So far as the employee is concerned, it is but the receipt
      of a portion of the capital his labor has previously produced. As the value
      paid in the wages is thus exchanged for a value brought into being by the
      labor, how can it be said that wages are drawn from capital or advanced
      by capital? As in the exchange of labor for wages the employer always gets
      the capital created by the labor before he pays out capital in the wages,
      at what point is his capital lessened even temporarily? &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
      I, Chapter 3: Wages and Capital: Wages not drawn from capital, but produced
      by the labor</p>
  <p>To recapitulate: The man who works for himself gets his wages in the things
    he produces, as he produces them, and exchanges this value into another form
    whenever he sells the produce. The man who works for another for stipulated
    wages in money, works under a contract of exchange. He also creates his wages
    as he renders his labor, but he does not get them except at stated times,
    in stated amounts and in a different form. In performing the labor he is
    advancing in exchange; when he gets his wages the exchange is completed.
    During the time he is earning the wages he is advancing capital to his employer,
    but at no time, unless wages are paid before work is done, is the employer
    advancing capital to him. Whether the employer who receives this produce
    in exchange for the wages, immediately re-exchanges it, or keeps it for awhile,
    no more alters the character of the transaction than does the final disposition
    of the product made by the ultimate receiver, who may, perhaps, be in another
    quarter of the globe and at the end of a series of exchanges numbering hundreds. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    I, Chapter 3: Wages and Capital: Wages not drawn from capital, but produced
    by the labor</p>
  <p> HERE, let us imagine, is an unbounded savannah, stretchIng off in unbroken
    sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires of the
    monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle he
    cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to wood,
    as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely no choice,
    and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out with the
    search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
    anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
    rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
    at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
    him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
    would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
    material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
    any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
    cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
    a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
    short a &quot;jack of all trades and master of none.&quot; He cannot have
    his children schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a
    teacher. Such things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities
    and keep on hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving
    his work and making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when
    forced to do so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of
    a broken auger may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under
    such circumstances, though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an
    easy matter for him to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will
    only suffice to satisfy the simplest wants in the rudest way.</p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section of the
    boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
    by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
    there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
    that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
    by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
    and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
    two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.</p>
  <p>Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
    there are already two. Another and another, until around our first comer
    there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in
    the solitary state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the
    settlers have a log-rolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly
    would require years. When one kills a bullock the others take part of it,
    returning when they kill, and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together
    they hire a schoolmaster, and the children of each are taught for a fractional
    part of what similar teaching would have cost the first settler. It becomes
    a comparatively easy matter to send to the nearest town, for some one is
    always going. But there is less need for such journeys. A blacksmith and
    a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our settler can have his tools repaired
    for a small part of the labor they formerly cost him. A store is opened and
    he can get what he wants as he wants it; a post-office, soon added, gives
    him regular communication with the rest of the world. Then comes a cobbler,
    a carpenter, a harnessmaker, a doctor; and a little church soon arises. Satisfactions
    become possible that in the solitary state were impossible. There are gratifications
    for the social and the intellectual nature &#8212; for that part of the man
    that rises above the animal. The power of sympathy, the sense of companionship,
    the emulation of comparison and contrast, open a wider and fuller and more
    varied life. In rejoicing, there are others to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners
    do not mourn alone. There are husking bees, and apple parings, and quilting
    parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered and the orchestra but a fiddle,
    the notes of the magician are yet in the strain, and Cupid dances with the
    dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire and enjoy; in the house
    of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands human sympathy to
    sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open up
    glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election times,
    come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and power,
    as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John Doe and
    Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus, talked
    of months before, and opening to children, whose horizon has been the prairie,
    all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of fairy
    tale, mail-clad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach, and
    the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in circling
    Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the sandy
    deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised Joseph
    from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps
    with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music that
    thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome of
    Kubla Khan.<br>
      <br>
      Go to our settler now, and say to him: &quot;You have so many fruit trees
      which you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in
      short, you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land
      itself is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it
      will need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements
      if you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
      of settlement.&quot; He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat
      or potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
      and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
      we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
      all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
      increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
      things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
      it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are yet
      no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as far
      removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went upon
      it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of this
      added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
      stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
      not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
      the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
      land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
      center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
      of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
      will be raised.</p>
  <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the economies
    which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
    of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population, the
    store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on it,
    or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows into a
    town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district. With
    no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this land now
    begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor expended in
    raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it. will yield no more of those things
    than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided branches of production
    which require proximity to other producers, and, especially, to labor expended
    in that final part of production, which consists in distribution, it will
    yield much larger returns. The wheat-grower may go further on, and find land
    on which his labor will produce as much wheat, and nearly as much wealth;
    but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper, the professional man,
    find that their labor expended here, at the center of exchanges, will yield
    them much more than if expended even at a little distance away from it; and
    this excess of productiveness for such purposes the landowner can claim,
    just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing power. And so our settler
    is able to sell in building lots a few of his acres for prices which it would
    not bring for wheat growing if its fertility had been multiplied many times.
    With the proceeds he builds himself a fine house, and furnishes it handsomely.
    That is to say, to reduce the transaction to its lowest terms, the people
    who wish to use the land, build and furnish the house for him, on condition
    that he will let them avail themselves of the superior productiveness which
    the increase of population has given the land.</p>
  <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
    to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown into
    a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago, or a San Francisco &#8212; and still
    it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with the best
    machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor becomes
    extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges are of such
    volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of friction and loss.
    Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism that has grown
    up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed one of the great
    ganglions of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither set all currents,
    through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you have anything to sell,
    is the market; here, if you have anything to buy, is the largest and the
    choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered into a focus, and
    here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision of mind with mind.
    Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries of knowledge,
    the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are museums and art
    galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and all things rare and
    valuable, the best of their kind. Here come great actors, and orators, and
    singers, from all over the world. Here, in short, is a center of human life,
    in all its varied manifestations.</p>
  <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
    of labor, that, instead of one man with a span of horses scratching over
    acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
    tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven, and
    eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
    engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands of
    horses. All these advantages adhere to the land; it is on this land, and
    no other, that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
    focus of exchanges, the market-place and workshop of the highest forms of
    industry. The productive powers which density of population has attached
    to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original fertility
    by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures the difference
    between this added productiveness and that of the least productive land in
    use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever has succeeded to
    his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another Rip Van Winkle,
    he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not from anything
    he has done, but from the increase of population. There are lots from which
    for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more than an average mechanic
    can earn; there are lots that will sell for more than would suffice to pave
    them with gold coin. In the principal streets are towering buildings, of
    granite, marble, iron, and plate-glass, finished in the most expensive style,
    replete with every convenience. Yet they are not worth as much as the land
    upon which they rest &#8212; the same land, in nothing changed, which, when
    our first settler came upon it, had no value at all. That this is the way
    in which the increase of population powerfully acts in increasing rent, whoever,
    in a progressive country, will look around him, may see for himself. The
    process is going on under his eyes. The increasing difference in the productiveness
    of the land in use, which causes an increasing rise in rent, results not
    so much from the necessities of increased population compelling the resort
    to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness which increased population
    gives to the lands already in use. The most valuable lands on the globe,
    the lands which yield the highest rent, are not lands of surpassing natural
    fertility, but lands to which a surpassing utility has been given by the
    increase of population. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book IV, Chapter
    2: Effect of Material Progress on the Distribution of Wealth: The Effect
    of Increase of Population upon the Distribution of Wealth</p>
  <p>ALL increase in the productive power of man over that with which nature
    endows the individual comes from the co-operation of individuals. But there
    are two ways in which this co-operation may take place. 1. By the combination
    of effort. In this way individuals may accomplish what exceeds the full power
    of the individual. 2. By the separation of effort. In this way the individual
    may accomplish for more than one what does not require the full power of
    the individual. . . . To illustrate: The first way of co-operation, the combination
    of labor, enables a number of men to remove a rock or to raise a log that
    would be too heavy for them separately. In this way men conjoin themselves,
    as it were, into one stronger man. Or, to take an example so common in the
    early days of American settlement that &quot;log-rolling&quot; has become
    a term for legislative combination: Tom, Dick, Harry and Jim are building
    near each other their rude houses in the clearings. Each hews his own trees,
    but the logs are too heavy for one man to get into place. So the four unite
    their efforts, first rolling one man's logs into place and then another's,
    until, the logs of all four having been placed, the result is the same as
    if each had been enabled to concentrate into one time the force he could
    exert in four different times. . . . But, while great advantages result from
    the ability of individuals, by the combination of labor to concentrate themselves,
    as it were, into one larger man, there are other times and other things in
    which an individual could accomplish more if he could divide himself, as
    it were, into a number of smaller men. . . . What the division of labor does,
    is to permit men, as it were, so to divide themselves, thus enormously increasing
    their total effectiveness. To illustrate from the example used before: While
    at times Tom, Dick, Harry and Jim might each wish to move logs, at other
    times they might each need to get something from a village distant two days'
    journey. To satisfy this need individually would thus require two days' effort
    on the part of each. But if Tom alone goes, performing the errands for all,
    and the others each do half a days' work for him, the result is that all
    get at the expense of half a day's effort on the part of each what otherwise
    would have required two days' effort. &#8212; The Science of Political Economy &#8212; unabridged:
    Book III, Chapter 9, The Production of Wealth: Cooperation &#8212; Its Two
    Ways &#8226; abridged: Part III, Chapter 7, The Production of Wealth: Co-operation:
    Its Two Ways</p>
  <p>WE have seen that there are two ways or modes in which co-operation increases
    productive power. If we ask how co-operation is itself brought about, we
    see that there is in this also a distinction, and that co-operation is of
    two essentially different kinds. . .. There is one kind of co-operation,
    proceeding, as it were, from without, which results from the conscious direction
    of a controlling will to a definite end. This we may call directed or conscious
    co-operation. There is another kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were,
    from within, which results from a correlation in the actions of independent
    wills, each seeking but its own immediate purpose, and careless, if not indeed
    ignorant, of the general result. This we may call spontaneous or unconscious
    co-operation. The movement of a great army is a good type of co-operation
    of the one kind. Here the actions of many individuals are subordinated to,
    and directed by, one conscious will, they becoming, as it were, its body
    and executing its thought. The providing of a great city with all the manifold
    things which are constantly needed by its inhabitants is a good type of co-operation
    of the other kind. This kind of co-operation is far wider, far finer, far
    more strongly and delicately organized, than the kind of co-operation involved
    in the movements of an army, yet it is brought about not by subordination
    to the direction of one conscious will, which knows the general result at
    which it aims, but by the correlation of actions originating in many independent
    wills, each aiming at its own small purpose without care for, or thought
    of; the general result. The one kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue
    in those related movements of our body which we are able consciously to direct.
    The other kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue in the correlation
    of the innumerable movement, of which we are unconscious, that maintain the
    bodily frame &#8212; motions which in their complexity, delicacy and precision
    far transcend our powers of conscious direction, yet by whose perfect adjustment
    to each other and to the purpose of the whole, that co-operation of part
    and function, that makes up the human body and keeps it in life and vigor,
    is brought about and supported. &#8212; The Science of Political Economy &#8212; unabridged:
    Book III, Chapter 10, The Production of Wealth: Cooperation &#8212; Its Two
    Kinds &#8226; abridged: Part III, Chapter 8, Cooperation: Its Two Kinds</p>
  <p>To attempt to apply that kind of co-operation which requires direction from
    without to the work proper for that kind of co-operation which requires direction
    from within, is like asking the carpenter who can build a chicken-house to
    build a chicken also. &#8212; The Science of Political Economy &#8212; unabridged:

    Kinds &#8226; abridged: Part III, Chapter 8, Cooperation: Its Two Kinds </p>
  <p> THE term labor includes all human exertion in the production of wealth,
    and wages, being that part of the produce which goes to labor, includes all
    reward for such exertion. There is, therefore, in the politico-economic sense
    of the term wages no distinction as to the kind of labor, or as to whether
    its reward is received through an employer or not, but wages means the return
    received for the exertion of labor, as distinguished from the return received
    for the use of capital, and the return received by the landholder for the
    use of land. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter 2: Wages
    and Capital: The Meaning of the Terms</p>
  <p>I AM aware that the theorem that wages are drawn from capital is one of
    the most fundamental and apparently best settled of current political economy,
    and that it has been accepted as axiomatic by all the great thinkers who
    have devoted their powers to the elucidation of the science. Nevertheless,
    I think it can be demonstrated to be a fundamental error &#8212; the fruitful
    parent of a long series of errors, which vitiate most important practical
    conclusions. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter 3: Wages
    and Capital: Wages not drawn from capital, but produced by the labor</p>
  <p>THE fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly grasped
    and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed form is but
    an elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and that principles obvious
    in the simpler relations of men are merely disguised and not abrogated or
    reversed by the more intricate relations that result from the division of
    labor and the use of complex tools and methods. . . . And so, if we reduce
    to their lowest terms all the complex operations of modern production, we
    see that each individual who takes part in this infinitely subdivided and
    intricate network of production and exchange is really doing what the primeval
    man did when he climbed the trees for fruit or followed the receding tide
    for shellfish &#8212; endeavoring to obtain from nature by the exertion of
    his powers the satisfaction of his desires. If we keep this firmly in mind,
    if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as the co-operation of all
    embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various desires of each,
    we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions comes as truly
    and as directly from nature as the result of that exertion, as did that of
    the first man.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: In the simplest state of which we can conceive, each man
    digs his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantage of the division
    of labor soon becomes apparent, and one digs bait while the others fish.
    Yet evidently the one who digs bait is in reality doing as much toward the
    catching of fish as any of those who actually take the fish. So when the
    advantages of canoes are discovered, and instead of all going a-fishing,
    one stays behind and makes and repairs canoes, the canoe-maker is in reality
    devoting his labor to the taking of fish as much as the actual fishermen,
    and the fish which he eats at night when the fishermen come home, are as
    truly the product of his labor as of theirs. And thus when the division of
    labor is fairly inaugurated, and instead of each attempting to satisfy all
    of his wants by direct resort to nature, one fishes, another hunts, a third
    picks berries, a fourth gathers fruit, a fifth makes tools, a sixth builds
    huts, and a seventh prepares clothing &#8212; each one is, to the extent
    he exchanges the direct product of his own labor for the direct product of
    the labor of others, really applying his own labor to the production of the
    things he uses &#8212; is in effect satisfying his particular desires by
    the exertion of his particular powers; that is to say, what he receives he
    in reality produces. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book I, Chapter
