    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q54. What relief could it bring to strictly agricultural towns, where the
    unimproved land values are very small?</em><br>
    A. However poor the town or heavy the taxes, it would at least tend the equalize
    their present tax burden. The assessed value of land in the three smallest
    towns of Massachusetts, Alford, Holland, and Peru, is $282,335, or more than
    three times that of the buildings. Allowing one half of the assessed valuation
    of land to be improvement value, the unimproved basis for taxation would
    be $141,168, or 60 percent more than the buildings. Thus an apportionment
    according to unimproved land values, increasing ever so slowly, would seem
    to be fairer than one according to improvements, which require constant renewal.

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[05] </span>There is a  suggestive fact that must impress any one who thinks over the history  of past eras and preceding civilizations. <strong>The great, wealthy and  powerful nations have always lost their freedom; it is only in small,  poor and isolated communities that Liberty has been maintained.</strong> So true  is this that the poets have always sung that Liberty loves the rocks  and the mountains; that she shrinks from wealth and power and splendor,  from the crowded city and the busy mart. So true is this that  philosophical historians have sought in the richness of material  resources the causes of the corruption and enslavement of peoples.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural. Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights  of the citizen, and political organization always starts from this  base. It is as social development goes on that we find power  concentrating, in institutions based upon the equality of rights  passing into institutions which make the many the slaves of the few.  How this is we may see. In all institutions which involve the lodgment  of governing power there is, with social growth, a tendency to the  exaltation of their function and the centralization of their power, and  in the stronger of these institutions a tendency to the absorption of  the powers of the rest. Thus the tendency of social growth is to make  government the business of a special class. And as numbers increase and  the power and importance of each become less and less as compared with  that of all, so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond  the scrutiny and control of the masses. <strong>The leader of a handful of  warriors, or head man of a little village, can command or govern only  by common consent, and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his  fellows.</strong> But when a tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a  populous country, the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition,  become practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny  of his acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder  successfully to appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he  directs becomes irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as  power thus concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of  thought grows up which regards the masses as born but for the service  of their rulers.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[07] </span>Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual  conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the  people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &mdash;  though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles and a  hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and  hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but  follow it. <strong>The same methods which, in a little town where each knows  his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city,  as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers  to gain and hold the government. </strong>So, too, as we see in Congress, and  even in our State legislatures, the growth of the country and the  greater number of interests make the proportion of the votes of a  representative, of which his constituents know or care to know, less  and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial departments tend  constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The mere growth of society
involves danger of the gradual
conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
follow it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The same methods which, in
a little town where each knows
his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great
city, as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of
plunderers to gain and hold the government. </span>So, too, as we see
in
Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the growth of the
country and the greater number of interests make the proportion of
the votes of a representative, of which his constituents know or care
to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
