<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation provides a stable source of revenue for local government,
      far better than income and sales taxes from this point of view, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">Painless Taxation</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
  <p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
    course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax.
    Most basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form,
    and they constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of
    any particular tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such
    principles but little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless
    of ideology or government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency,
    equity, administrability, simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax
    theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or all of
    these criteria: ...<strong> Stability</strong> refers to the ability of a
    tax to produce revenue in the face of changing economic circumstances. Income
    and sales taxes, for example, vary greatly according to phases in the economic
    cycle; the property tax, in contrast, is highly stable regardless of the
    state of the economy. This is one reason why school administrators have typically
    been supportive of using the property tax base rather than some other tax
    to support school services.</p>

      Our Towns Got That
      Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Stability</b> refers to the
ability of a tax to produce revenue
in the face of changing economic circumstances. Income and sales
taxes, for example, vary greatly according to phases in the economic
cycle; the property tax, in contrast, is highly stable regardless of
the state of the economy. Followers of economist John Maynard Keynes
believe that revenues should be inverse to the cycles of the economy;
i.e., that the government should be used to stabilize or boost the
economy as occasions require. I should add as an aside that <strong>th</strong><b>ere
are some theorists who believe that, were revenue sources completely
based on land value, economic cycles would disappear.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In assessing the value of a tax it
is also important, of course,
to understand its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of
government. This is usually deemed revenue sufficiency. Income, sales
and property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent,
have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. In contrast, if you take the time to
look at a tax on land value alone, it measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span
