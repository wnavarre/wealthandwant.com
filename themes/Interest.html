the Object -- Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, look at it here today, in
this new country, where there are
as yet only 65 millions of us scattered over a territory that in the
present stage of the arts is sufficient to support in comfort a
thousand millions; yet we are actually thinking and talking as if
there were too many people in the country. We want more wealth. Why
don't we get it? Is any factor of production short? What are the
factors of production? Labour, capital, and land; but to put them in
the order of their importance: land, labour, capital. We want more
wealth; what is the difficulty? Is it in labour; is there not enough
labour? No. From all parts of the United States we hear of what seems
like a surplus of labour. We have actually got to thinking that the
man who gives another employment is giving him a boon. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Is there any
scarcity of capital? Why, so abundant is capital today that United
States bonds, bought at the current rate, will only yield a fraction
over 2% per annum. So abundant is capital that there can be no doubt
that a government loan could be floated today at 2% and little doubt
but that it would soon command a premium. So abundant is capital that
all over the country it is pressing for remunerative employment.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the limitation is not in
labour and not in capital, it must be
in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
Francisco? Go to that great city of New York, where people are
crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. Yet, why are there
not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
which to build more houses. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Today one half of the area of New
York City is unbuilt
upon &#8212; is absolutely unused. When there is such a pressure, why
don't people go to these vacant lots and build there? Because though
unused, the land is owned; because, speculating upon the future
growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.
What you see in New York, you may see everywhere. Come into the
coalfields of Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands
and thousands of miners unable to work, either locked out by their
employers, or striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages
being cut down a little more.&nbsp; </small><small><a

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q49. Would the single tax abolish interest?</em><br>
A. I do not think so. Interest properly understood is a form of wages, and so
  far from abolishing it, the single tax, which would tend to increase all forms
  of wages, would tend to increase interest. But monopoly profits are often confounded
  with interest, and by force of association have given to interest a bad name;
  these would be minimized if not wholly abolished by the single tax. It is impossible
  to answer this question intelligibly to everyone who asks it, without requiring
  him to be specific; for it is seldom that two persons agree as to what they
  mean by interest. The Western farmer thinks of the high rate that he pays,
  partly for risk, partly from his ignorance of the <em>modus operandi</em> of banking,
  and partly because legitimate banking facilities are scarce in his Community;
  the Wall Street operator thinks of the premiums that he pays for currency in
  times of stress to tide him over from day to day; others think of &quot;interest&quot; on
  government bonds, and others of dividends of companies with valuable land rights.
  None of these payments are really interest, and the single tax would tend to
  rid society of them. But that advantage which the workmen enjoy whose implements
  and materials are already gathered, over those who have yet to devote time
  to gathering implements and materials, an advantage which is expressed in money
  and as interest upon capital, will not, I should think, be abolished by anything
  that man can do. The value of such an advantage is part of the wages of the
  labor that creates it. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Proper
Disposition of Returns to Different Factors of Production</b>
</small><br>
<small>The idea that the rent of land is properly collected by
governments is an example of the more general idea that it is
important to distinguish the different "factors of production"
identified by classical political economy. The return to each factor
has a proper destination.
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The contributions of human abilities to productive efforts
are called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">labor</span>," the return
to labor is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">wages</span>," and
the appropriate recipients of wages are those whose labor contributes
to productive activities.</small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>The contributions of
past human products to productive efforts are called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">capital</span>," the return to capital is
called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">interest</span>," and the
appropriate recipients of interest are those who past saving made the
creation of capital possible.</small></li>
  <li><small>The contributions of government-assigned opportunities to
the productive process are called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">land</span>,"
the return to land is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">rent</span>,"
and the appropriate recipient of rent is the public treasury.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Replacing Existing
Taxes</b>
</small><br>
<small>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the public
treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing
sources of public revenue.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those who contribute labor to productive processes should
be allowed to keep the wages that result from their labor.</small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>Those whose saving
makes the creation of capital possible should be allowed to keep the
interest that accrues from the use of capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>But there is no one who has a corresponding claim to the
return to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and
other opportunities assigned by government ought to be the primary
source of government revenue.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While one might call such fees
"taxes," we consider that
designation inappropriate, because the word "tax" connotes an
exaction from someone of something to which he or she has a just
claim, and we deny that there are such just claims with respect to
land. We expect that the collection of fees for the full value of
opportunities assigned by governments would provide adequate revenue
for all necessary government expenditures.</small><small> ...&nbsp; <a

Justice In Australia: INTERMEDIATE KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We've just seen how returns from
land are, by nature, monopolistic and,
by rights, should be returned to the community. But how do we calculate
this amount?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO GETS THE COCONUTS?</span></small><br>
<small>It's perhaps best illustrated by the Robinson Crusoe scenario,
where he
finds himself alone on a desert island. Rob naturally settles on the
best available land which, for argument's sake, can produce 20 coconuts
per acre per month. Along comes Man Friday, who gets the second-best
land producing 18 coconuts per acre. This best, freely-available land
of Friday is called the marginal land and, as we'll see, determines
both the level of wages and that of rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For how much could Rob rent out his land - 2 coconuts or 20
coconuts
per acre? Friday would only be prepared to pay 2, because he can
already get 18 from his. So here's our first definition, that of the
Law of Rent: The application of labour and capital equipment being
equal, the rent of land is determined by the difference between the
value of its produce and that of the least productive land in use. So
if Man Saturday comes along (the next day?!) and finds that the best
available land can only produce 15 coconuts per acre, Rob could rent
his land out to Saturday for 5 coconuts per acre, and Friday for 2.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What then determines the level
of wages?</span>
When Friday came along and could work land yielding 18 coconuts per
acre in a month, then he wouldn't accept wages offered by Rob for less
than 18 coconuts. But when Saturday arrived, suddenly Friday could only
command 15 per month, because Rob knows that the going rate (that
applicable to Saturday at the margin) is only 15. So here we have the
Law of Wages, which is the corollary of the law of rent: Wages are the
reward that labour can obtain on marginal land, i.e. the most
productive land available to it without paying rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Of course it all gets more complicated by technology, trade
unions,
immigration, the existence of a pool of unemployed, personal
preferences, levels of education etc., but these strong underlying laws
always hold. But let's now tie up the factors of production. Rent is
the return to land, wages are the return to labour, and interest is the
return to capital. The law of interest can be stated thus: Interest is
the return that the use of capital equipment can obtain on marginal
land, i.e. the most productive land available to it without paying
rent. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done. ...</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Site values as the
economy's "credit sink"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">TO
CLARIFY MATTERS it may help to think of "land" in the broad
sense of comprising all elements of property value that cannot be
explained in terms of capital investment and its profits. </span>This
category includes the site's locational value. Site value is the
essence of long-term planning by real estate developers at the local
level. But an examination of the economy-wide figures shows property
prices to be determined by broad macroeconomic factors, headed by the
availability of mortgage credit. Real estate is the major recipient
of bank credit, and price waves or cycles are determined largely by
the supply of mortgage loans and their interest rates.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Stated the other way around, the
costs of reproducing buildings
and structures are "sunk costs". Price trends are determined not by
yesterday's supply prices but by today's market demand as
supplemented by mortgage credit. If anything, buildings, plant and
equipment wear out and depreciate, but their obsolescence is offset
(and indeed, usually more than offset) by the rise in their site
value. This rise reflects the desirability of real estate as an
investment vehicle, the prime recipient of the economy's savings and
source of new credit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After 1990, for instance, when
commercial banks found real estate
to be largely "loaned up," they reduced the rates paid to depositors,
as they did not have an alternative use for these deposits. The
allocation of America's savings shifted away from banks and their
real estate lending to other forms of investment as depositors began
to shift their savings into money-market funds invested mainly in
bonds, and then into mutual funds invested largely in stocks. This
shift was largely responsible for the stock market's remarkable
takeoff, substantially in advance of the real estate recovery.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One would think that land prices
would play a central role in
modern business cycle analysis, if only because a large share of
stock market value consists of corporately owned real estate. Since
the late 1940s "concealed value" in the form of properties carried at
outdated book values reflecting low acquisition prices was a major
factor behind corporate raiding, mergers and acquisitions. Aggressive
firms employed accountants to pour over the Stock Exchange's 10K
reports searching for such hidden values. But macroeconomists lacked
the statistics needed to follow how the business cycle affected land
prices, that is, the "non-building" aspect of real estate value. This
made it difficult to provide meaningful analyses of corporate net
worth and the causes of its rise and fall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How,
then, can business cycle statistics be collected without land
values as a prime indicator?</span> After all, it is the inflation of
real
estate asset prices that provides real estate owners with the
collateral to justify further borrowing from banks to acquire yet
more property. And by the same token, falling land prices extinguish
the collateral that backs the banking system's savings, leading to
financial insolvency.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The real estate cycle is
essentially a credit cycle.</b>
Traditionally, land acquisition has been the object of recycling
savings and extending new credit. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Site
values are the economy's
"credit sink" as well as its ultimate "savings sink".</span> This is
why
real estate values reflect the economy's rising and declining
financial surplus. Profits fall as business upswings approach their
crest and the economic surplus available for saving declines. A lower
volume of loanable funds means that less credit is available to real
estate developers, speculators and homebuyers, curtailing their
ability to bid up prices with borrowed funds. Borrowing to buy
buildings is discouraged by the fact that when interest rates rise,
more of the rental income must be paid to lenders.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In sum, just as
real estate lending fuels land speculation, so the
withdrawal of such credit leaves property markets to decline,
sometimes with a crash, as occurred in Japan after 1990 when its
financial bubble burst. Should this rise and fall be attributed to
buildings or to land? It seems to me that inasmuch as the price rise
and fall is homogeneous, applying to parking lots as well as to
skyscrapers, we should attribute it to land. This achieves the
logical symmetry of applying to the downturns as well as upturns in
the real estate cycle. ...

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be
minimized in two ways.</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><b>The most general -- and also the most economically
pernicious -- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. The
working assumption is that interest charges are a truly inherent
business expense, not simply the result of a business decision taken by
investors to leverage their equity. For interest to be an inherent
business expense, interest-bearing debt would have to be a factor of
production, which it is not. Properties would yield their rent
regardless of how they are financed. Investors choose to rely on debt
rather than equity financing because the tax laws favor it, thanks to
the political lobbying of <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutional
creditors ("the debt lobby")</span>. Homeowners too deduct interest
payments, which encourages borrowing.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to
depreciation the building, that is, annually deduct from taxable income
part of the purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is
"written off" </b>It's the most unique tax advantage enjoyed by the
real estate industry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investors
are able to depreciate their buildings based on their assessed
acquisition price, regardless of the actual building costs involved or
the level of economy-wide land-price inflation. </span>Investors
depreciate buildings at rising prices even when prior owners already
have depreciated these structures once or even many times. For real
estate owned by households and partnerships (the latter being the
preferred legal instrument for holding residential apartment buildings
and office buildings), the Fed has estimated much higher proportions of
land to buildings, but these estimates also overvalue buildings
relative to land. <b>Every time a property changes hands at a higher
price, building assessments are raised proportionally - and begin to be
re-depreciated for these higher valuations, regardless of how often the
buildings already have been written off! There is no limit as to how
often a building can be re-depreciated.</b> What matters is simply how
often the property changes nominal hands.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
fiscal privilege has created a phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out.<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>SUMMARY<br>
<br>
For hundreds of years property's value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental stream
will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more years' rent
a property will bring. What is so striking about land values today is
that they are rising for reasons independent of their earnings stream.
The major new consideration is their prospect for future "capital"
(that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate aim of real estate
investors no longer is so much to seek income -- most of which is
pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the property they
acquire -- as much as to seek property gains. Politically opportunites
abound. Merely changing zoning in New York City in the 1980s to allow
using commercial loft spaces for residential purposes had the effect of
multiplying asset values five or tenfold.<br>
<br>
Whether the gains come from selling the property or from borrowing more
money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth in asset
values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment. That's why
investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks, and much of
the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed the strategies
they developed over the past half century.<br>
<br>
Nationwide the capital-gains dimension needs to be incorporated into
the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total returns.
This sector's nearly complete success in escaping the tax collector has
placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
