<blockquote>
  <p>While Georgists believe that taxing land value is the fairest of all the taxes
      we could use to fund public spending, most Georgists also believe that revenue
      sharing is absolutely vital. There are many places in America where local land
      rent is not high enough to support public education adequately. But there are
      also many places in America that have awesomely high land rents, which could
      be used to finance public education in other parts of the country, much the
      way federal spending now is distributed geographically very differently from
      the collection of income taxes. </p>
  <p>In many towns, particularly in the northeast, the superintendent of schools
    is paid far more than the mayor is. This is in part related to the fact that
    the superintendent of schools can have more influence on local land values
    than the mayor can: homebuyers will flock to towns whose educational offerings
    are perceived as above average (whether the relevant measure is the percentage
    of students passing various tests, graduating from high school, attending
    college or admitted to Ivy League colleges.) The peculiar part?
    It is the retiree leaving town for Florida who reaps the
    benefit,
    in
    the
    form
    of
    a

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs
      a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new building
      on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the
      real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this
      land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is good,
      the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good
      and very fast, and business is good here." </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real
      estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the
      person who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
      build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
      at all!&quot;</p>

    11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
    and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
      two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
      and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
      And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
      effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
      the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
      community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
      as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
      equality. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proposition that the rental
value of land should be collected by
governments and used for public purposes has a powerful moral
rationale: Since no one made the land, no one can properly claim to own
it. There is a simple efficiency rationale as well: Social collection
of the rental value of land does not interfere with incentives to be
productive. If governments do not collect the rental value of land,
then they will levy taxes that discourage productive activity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When "government" is not a monolith but a collection of entities
with
responsibilities in different geographic and functional areas, these
rationales for land value taxation leave unanswered the question of how
the rental value of land should be allocated among governments. That
question is addressed in this paper.</small></div>

<p> Nic
Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The
Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
is dubious or worse. We tell
our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
taxation is the following: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed? <strong>...
</strong> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:

</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>would such a system be fair? <strong>...</strong></small>  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus local public services are
financed efficiently when users
are required to pay marginal costs, and the component of total cost
that is not covered by marginal cost charges is financed by levies on
land that collect the increases in rental value of land that result
from provision of the service.</b> If all citizens in a locality
valued the service equally, then every increment in the level of the
service that was worthwhile would have a cost that was less than or
equal to the sum of the revenue that could be raised from charges for
use equal to marginal cost and the increase in the rental value of
land in the community that resulted from the availability of the
service. When people value the service differently, the increase in
the rental value of land that results from the provision of a service
will be less than the value of the service to those who receive it.
By a criterion of maximizing the real incomes of residents, the best
outcome that covers the full cost of a service will involve a level
of service somewhat lower than that for which marginal cost is equal
to the sum of marginal benefits, along with charges that exceed
somewhat the marginal cost of providing the service to additional
persons. Still, in general, the combination of user fees
approximately equal to marginal cost and taxes on land to finance the
remainder of costs is capable of providing financing for local public
services that is adequate and reasonably efficient.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Next consider fairness.</b> The
fairness of such financing is
the fairness of incremental decisions in an environment in which the
initial allocation is fair. (It does not provide special
opportunities for disadvantaged persons. They would need to be
provided for by insurance that operated independently of the
provision of public goods.) A person who is treated fairly in the
absence of public goods cannot reasonably complain about being
required to pay for a service according to its marginal cost, or
about have to pay the value that is added to his land by the
availability of a public service.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the latter case, there is an
argument that must be answered. A
person may say, "It is true that the provision of this public service
adds as much to the rental value of my land as I am being taxed, but
that is what the service is worth to someone else who might use my
land. It's not worth that to me. In fact, the 'service' reduces my
well-being." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here we have a difficulty. We have
no way of identifying the value
of a service that is provided to a person without his request. If we
express a willingness to respond to such statements, people will have
a motive for faking a lack of interest in the service in order to
reduce their tax bills. If a person can point to some characteristic
of his circumstances that would tend to support the claim that he
does not value the service (for example, if the service is concerts
in the park and the person is deaf, or if the services is a sewer
line and the person just put in a new septic system), then we may
have an obligation to compensate the person for raising his taxes to
pay for something that he does not value. But when the person can
point to no such special circumstances, he should bear the cost.
People should understand that one of the risks of moving into a
community is that their fellow citizens may decide to provide a local
public service that most people value but they do not. At worst, the
aggrieved person will have to bear the costs of moving (including the
psychological costs). Thus if any compensation is offered to people
who have characteristics that suggest that they do not value a public
service that raises the value of their land, the compensation that
they receive should have an upper limit of the loss in the value of
things attached to the land (the septic system) plus the financial
and psychological costs of moving. While we need to watch out for
fakers, these are real costs, and a public service is only worthwhile
if its benefits exceed its full costs, including losses in the value
of capital and in the human satisfaction of those who did not want
change. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The fairness of such a tax system
might also be questioned from
another perspective. If people are required to pay the costs of the
public services that they use, then who will pay for schools?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two possible answers. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One possibility is that people will agree on the value of
living in a community where children are well educated, whether they
have children or not, and they will find the presence of another child
in the community to be a benefit for which the cost of educating the
child is not too high a price to pay. In this case, educational
expenditures add to the value of land throughout the community, and
education can be financed efficiently by land taxes, without requiring
students or their parents to pay. Those who pay will be receiving
benefits that are equal to what they pay. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second possibility is that there will be a consensus
that, whether anyone wants to pay or not, education is a birthright of
all children. In this case, the birthright can be financed efficiently
by a tax on land, since land does not leave town or work less hard when
it is taxed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But is such a tax fair? Consider
first a case in which everyone
has the same number of children. Then the taxation of land value to
finance education is equivalent to the assertion of an equal claim of
everybody to land. And there is a good basis for such a claim. No one
made the land. The titles to land that we recognize today generally
originated in conquest. Our affection for the words of the
Declaration of Independence, that "All men are created equal," in
conjunction with the recognition that titles to land are privileges
that are created by government, should lead us to the implication
that we have an obligation to share the benefits of land equally. As
Henry George pointed out (1960 [1879], 403-407), the sensible
way to assert equal rights to land is not to divide the land equally,
but rather to collect the rent of land and use it for public
purposes. A tax on land takes for public purposes only what nature,
public services, and the growth of communities produce, unlike taxes
on labor and capital, which take what people produce and which people
may properly resent having taken from them. Thus, at least when
everyone has the same number of children, it is fair to finance
education by taxing land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now consider how the situation
changes when people have different
numbers of children. Consider two possibilities. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it is possible that additional children provide a
benefit to everyone in society, because the number of persons with whom
everyone can interact will be greater. If this benefit is as large as
the cost of education, then there is no unfairness in paying for the
education of all children from public funds. </small></li>
  <li><small>On the other hand if the birth of an additional child does
not provide general benefits as large as the cost of educating the
child, or if it generates crowding costs, then people who have more
children than average can rightfully be required to pay those costs. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"But wait!" you may say. "Many
people will not be able to afford
to pay the cost of educating their children. How can you expect them
to do so?" </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I would like to turn the question
around. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If people cannot be
expected to pay for educating the children that they ought to be able
to have, doesn't that mean that there is some fundamental unfairness
in the starting conditions? Is it not the combination of past
injustice and current unequal access to natural opportunities that
makes us reluctant to require people to pay the full costs of having
children?</span> In my conception of justice, we have not adequately
compensated for past injustice until we have put people in a position
where we are content to oblige them to pay the full costs of their
choices. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is another potential
inequality that needs to be
addressed.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> What if different
communities have different amounts of
land value per person?</span> Here a distinction in sources of land
value
must be made. If a community has higher land value because it has
built itself into a wonderful place, then it should be allowed to
keep that value for itself. On the other hand, if a community has a
higher-than-average natural endowment per citizen, then it owes
something to communities with lower-than-average natural endowment
per citizen. A program of payments among communities to equalize
natural endowments per citizen will be both efficient and fair. It
will be efficient because in the absence of such a program, people
would gravitate to the communities with higher-than-average natural
endowments (like Alaska) even when it was socially uneconomic for
them to go there. It is fair because it accords with an equal right
of all to natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus just and efficient local
taxation is achieved by the
combination of public collection of rent, marginal cost charges for
public services, and a program of transfers among communities to
equalize natural endowment per citizen. ... </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The shortcomings of property taxes as
revenue producers have been obvious for a long time and are widely known</span>.
The main difficulty is that revenues from property taxation do not keep
pace with the ever-increasing requirements of local governments. Every
county, every city official and every school administrator will
testify, that there are not enough funds available to meet the
requirements of local governments.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The inability of local government to raise enough revenues from
property taxation has forced them to borrow at an ever-increasing rate.
The debts of local governments have increased from about $16 billions
in 1947 to over $61 billions in 1963, an increase of about 382%. During
the same period private debt increased by 279% and federal debt by only
26%. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Under our property tax system wealthy communities with expensive
homes
or with heavy concentration of industry will have a large tax basis and
low tax rates. Schools will be good and public services will be
adequate. Yet in a poor community the tax base will be much smaller,
tax rates will be much higher and still it will be found impossible to
provide for good schools and adequate public services.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a pamphlet entitled <span

schools</span> the Committee for Economic Development came to the
conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"where a
child happens to live is likely to be important in determining the
quality of his education. In some areas children are taught by meagerly
qualified teachers in substandard schools with inadequate equipment.
The school session is shorter and the school leaving age is lower than
the national average."</span></small><br

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into
wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be
desired.
Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
tax bill will be.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land. </span><small><big><big><a

    Morality of Taxation: The Local Case</a></div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But is such a tax fair? Consider first a case in which everyone has
        the same number of children. Then the taxation of land value to finance
        education
        is equivalent to the assertion of an equal claim of everybody to land.
        And there is a good basis for such a claim. No one made the land. The
        titles
        to land that we recognize today generally originated in conquest. Our
        affection for the words of the Declaration of Independence, that "All men are created
        equal," in conjunction with the recognition that titles to land are privileges
        that are created by government, should lead us to the implication that
        we have an obligation to share the benefits of land equally. As Henry
        George
        pointed out (1960 [1879], 403-407), the sensible way to assert equal
        rights to land is not to divide the land equally, but rather to collect
        the rent
        of land and use it for public purposes. A tax on land takes for public
        purposes only what nature, public services, and the growth of communities
        produce,
        unlike taxes on labor and capital, which take what people produce and
        which people may properly resent having taken from them. Thus, at least
        when everyone
        has the same number of children, it is fair to finance education by taxing
        land. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">read the whole article</a></p>
