<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
    entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such
    relations as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment
    of the results. There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
    validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced
    by labor &#8212; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to
    deprive him without his will is theft.</p>
  <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
    is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
    by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
  <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
    in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But
    he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may
    sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
    such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
    in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
    labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
    sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
    the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use,
    but none may claim as his alone.</p>
  <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
    justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
    rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
    to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
    which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of
    his rightful property and thus robbed.</p>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
    that Christ, in becoming the son of a carpenter and himself working as a
    carpenter, showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing to be ashamed of in
    seeking one&#8217;s bread by labor.&#8221; To say that is almost like saying
    that by not robbing people he showed that there is nothing to be ashamed
    of in honesty. If you will consider how true in any large view is the classification
    of all men into working-men, beggar-men and thieves, you will see that it
    was morally impossible that Christ during his stay on earth should have been
    anything else than a working-man, since he who came to fulfil the law must
    by deed as well as word obey God&#8217;s law of labor.</p>
  <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
    this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is
    appointed that all should enter it, <strong>he lovingly took what in the
    natural order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that
    one generation
    owes to its immediate successors. </strong>Arrived at maturity, he earned his own
    subsistence by that common labor in which the majority of men must and do
    earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere
    of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual
    truths, receiving its material wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers,
    and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet.
    So, when he chose his disciples, he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
    who live on the labor of others, but to common laboring-men. And when he
    called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral
    and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without condescension on the
    one hand or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such
    labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus
    showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist in what is called
    manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual,
    moral or spiritual fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>

  <p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
    poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute
    to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
    impious violation of his benevolent intention. In the rudest stage of the
    arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn a living.
    With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be possible for all
    to earn much more. And so, in saying that poverty is no disgrace, you convey
    an unreasonable implication. For poverty ought to be a disgrace, since in
    a condition of social justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives
    or unimposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

generations having access to technology that earlier generations did
not have. Thus a nation that provides the rest of the world with

    Global Economic Justice</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Resources
that Fluctuate over Time</b>
<br>
The natural opportunities that have been considered to this point
are ones that, to a first approximation, yield constant returns over
time. A new set of issues arises when this theory of social justice
is applied to resources that yield returns that necessarily vary over
time. Now the issue of intergenerational justice arises along with
that of international justice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the issue of
intergenerational justice without the
complication of international concerns. The efficient use of
depletable natural opportunities requires that they be allocated over
time in such a way as to maximize the present value of net revenue
from sales. As economists have long known, this requires that prices
charged for resources that are being depleted rise at the rate of
interest. But this is just efficiency. It says nothing about who
should get the money.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The axiom that all persons have
equal rights to natural
opportunities suggests that when we deplete a resource such as oil,
there are two steps that must be taken to achieve intergenerational
equity. In the first step, when oil is sold we must share the
proceeds over generations in such a way that every person in every
generation can receive a payment of the same real value every year.
To satisfy this obligation when the number of people alive in
different years is not proportional to the amount of oil used in
those years, we need to invest the proceeds of oil sales in a fund
that would make annual payments to all persons of a size that could
be maintained for all generations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This first step provides
intergenerational equity with respect to
oil revenue, but it does nothing about the fact that, if oil is
allocated efficiently over time, later generations will face a higher
price of oil than early generations. To provide equity with respect
to the changing price of access to natural opportunities, there must
be a second step that redistributes money among generations to offset
the changing price.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This second step implicitly
assumes a world with no change in
technology. If an early generation provides later generations with
improved technology, then the later generations are treated justly if
the combination of prices of commodities, technology and money
received from the earlier generation permits them to attain the same
overall level of satisfaction as the earlier generation. This
specification of justice presumes that everyone has the same tastes.
When tastes differ, an improvement in technology that more than
compensates some persons for a greater scarcity of some natural
resources will provide inadequate compensation for others. Such
inequality cannot be avoided. All that can be expected is that those
who use exhaustible resources will, by limiting their use and
providing endowments for future generations, make it possible for the
typical member of every future generation to attain the same level of
well-being as the typical members of the earlier generations of
resource users. Success in such an effort cannot be guaranteed. We
don't know the tastes of future generations. We don't know the rate
at which technology will advance. We don't know the rate at which new
resources will be discovered. Estimates of all these things must be
made to determine the proper rate of resource use and the proper
endowments of future generations. The most that can be asked for is a
good-faith effort to achieve the standard required by justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now
consider the international dimension of intergenerational
equity. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What one
nation owes to others with respect to
intergenerational equity is compensation for making it more difficult
for the other nations to provide adequately for their future
generations. If all nations are using the same amount of oil per
capita, then no nation can complain about what the others are doing.
</span>But if one nation is using more oil per capita than the others,
then
it owes compensation to the others for making it harder for the
others to provide all of their future generations with equal rights
to natural opportunities. If oil is being allocated efficiently and
equitably among generations, the amount of compensation that an
excessively consuming nation owes will be the market value of its
excess oil consumption, valued in terms of the price of oil in the
ground. The same result is obtained if all nations include the
resource value of all oil that they consume, and all other depletable
resources, in the calculation of what they appropriate for themselves
from everyone's common heritage.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of the ways that a nation can
compensate other nations for
disproportionate use of natural opportunities is by creating
technology that other nations can use to compensate their future
generations for scarcer natural resources. If gasoline costs twice as
much but cars are twice as efficient, people are not, on net,
disadvantaged by the higher price of gasoline. This line of reasoning
requires contestable judgements about the value of new technology and
how long it would have taken before someone else would have made the
same discovery. Nevertheless, technological improvements are a valid
form of compensation for resource scarcity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One issue that arises when
technological improvements are used as
compensation is that not all nations place the same value on
technology. If some island nation wishes to maintain a way of life
that does not involve cars, then that nation is not compensated for
an increased scarcity of fish by increased efficiency of car engines.
What compensates a particular nation must reflect the typical
preferences of that nation.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another troublesome issue with
respect to natural opportunities is
that people have different ideas about which creatures are properly
treated simply as resources and which deserve a higher level of
respect. When creatures are non-migratory, the right to control them
can simply go with the land they occupy, and bids for the land will
reflect values with respect to the creatures that occupy the land.
However, with migratory creatures such as whales and songbirds, a
different mechanism must be created to deal with desires to protect.
If nations representing 80% of the world's population want to protect
whales, then they should be able to protect 80% of whales. How such a
rule would be implemented in practice is a problem that I leave for
others to wrestle with.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

investing the net proceeds of depletion in capital and paying
dividends to all generations. This could be done centrally or by
individual nations. In any case, a determination of whether a
nation's claim to territory is disproportionate requires
consideration of the nation's appropriation of depletable natural
resources as well as its appropriation of sustainable rent.</small></div>

rather, is what should be aspired to, an increase in quality,

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Underlying the whole agenda is a
commitment beyond simple description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It
presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units.</span> It recognizes that governments must take a hand
in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<small><span

&#8220;Human Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,&#8221; BioScience,
Vol. 36, No.6 (1986), pp. 368-373, available at
http://dieoff.org/page83.htm. It calculates that consumption of earth&#8217;s
resources is doubles at an ever increasing rate, and that humans have
already appropriated 40% of terrestrial biological productivity. The
most comprehensive collection of articles addressing this perspective
is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at
www.dieoff.org. The site name arises from his view that the world
economy&#8217;s dependence upon fossil fuels faces an imminent end, and the
earth will then be capable of supporting only about two billion people.
Hence a looming dieoff.

<small>The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental
challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage
and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, in instances where incentives require altered
behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes, sometimes also
called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases.... <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html"><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site Value Rating</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If site value rating is used only to finance local public services and to
    reward private activities that raise the rental value of land, the resulting
    reductions in other taxes on commerce and housing can be expected to raise
    the rental value of land by enough that land will retain most of its present
    sale value, and there will be no issue of compensating the existing owners
    of land. On the other hand, if the full rental value of land is collected through
    site value rating, then the sale value of unimproved land will fall to approximately
    zero. The sale value of houses will fall to the value of the houses themselves.
    Do the owners of land deserve compensation for these reductions in the market
  value of their wealth?</p>
  <p>First, it should be pointed out that the average taxpayer will pay the same
    tax as before, but in a different form. Site value rating will be substituted
    for some combination of income taxes, excise taxes, community charges, property
    value rates, and other taxes. A person should not complain about a change in
    the form of the taxes he pays if the total is the same. The above argument
    would be sufficient if every individual paid the same total tax after the change,
    but of course this will not occur. To some extent, increases in the sale value
    of capital will offset decreases in the sale value of land. This occurs because,
    by a removal of taxes from capital, site value rating will greatly increase
    the private returns to capital. This will generate a massive flow of capital
    toward any nation or region that reduces its taxes on capital. But such flows
    cannot occur instantaneously, and before they are completed the reductions
    in taxes on capital will raise the value of capital. In general, young persons
    will benefit more than older persons from a move to site value rating, because
    they tend to own less expensive plots of land if they own land at all, and
    they have many years ahead of them to benefit from reduction in other taxes.
    Those who are yet unborn will benefit most of all, because their birthrights
    to equal shares of the provenance of nature, as well as to the product of their
    labour, will be recognized. Net financial losses will tend to be greatest for
    older persons. Their houses will fall in sale value. They will be required
    to pay annually the rental value of the land on which their houses sit, without
    as much in reductions of their income taxes, and with fewer years ahead of
    them to reap tax savings. On the other hand, they will have less concern about
    providing for their children, because houses will be much easier for their
    children to acquire. Further offsetting any claim to compensation would be
    any past unearned profits that potential claimants had made on ownership of
    land.</p>
  <p>In some circumstances, a claim for compensation would have merit. If a person
    had purchased a title to land from the government just before the introduction
    of site value rating, that person could reasonably claim compensation from
    government action that eliminated the value of his purchase. Even if a substantial
    amount of time has passed, it can be argued that a government should not be
    permitted to eliminate by legislation the value of an asset that it has sold.
    On this basis, anyone who owned land that was at one time purchased from the
    government would have a reasonable claim on a return of the (inflation adjusted)
    price for which the land was purchased from the government. A claim for interest
    on the purchase price could not be sustained, however. The use of the land
    since the time of purchase offsets the interest that could otherwise be claimed.

    Unfair Taxation</a> (1913)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most of our laws were made by the dead, and the dead have no right to legislate
      for the living. The present generation has no right to bind its legislation
      upon the generation still unborn. When one generation is dead, it ought
    to stay dead and not reach out its dead hand to bind the living. We have
    no right
      to fix terms and conditions for those yet unborn; it is for each generation
      to fix the rules and regulations for itself. The earth should be owned
    by all men, the coal mines should belong to the people who live here, so
    they can
      take what they want while they live, as when they are dead they won't need
      coal &#8212; they will be warm enough without it &#8212; and they should not
      have the power to say who shall have it when they are gone. Carnegie and Morgan
      cannot use or withhold it much longer, as they will soon be gone &#8212; that
      is one consolation. </p>
  <p>... The single tax theory is that the public should take all the value of
      land, as it was made by the public. Land value goes up because of population,
      and not because of the owner of the title deed, and the value should be taken
      by the community, and thus create a natural fund from which to make improvements
      for the comfort of all, and thus make life easier. It would abolish poverty,
      that crime of the century, which has always come with civilization; inequality
      of wealth, which comes as the world grows older, and which we have never been
      able to cure, because man wants to hold what he cannot use, and pass on to
      future generations what they will not use. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    There&#8217;s even an economic theory explaining this: Mancur Olson&#8217;s
    logic of collective action. Olson, a Harvard economist, argued that unless
    the number of players in a group is very small, people won&#8217;t combine
    to pursue their common interests. For example, if the CEOs of five major
    airlines decide they want a $500 million government bailout, they pool their
    resources and hire a lobbying firm. Together they tell Congress that without
    the $500 million, their companies won&#8217;t survive, and the consequences
    of their collapse will be dire.</p>
  <p>Who lobbies against them? No one. The reason is that, while the five airlines
    will gain about $100 million each, the average taxpayer will lose only $5
    each. It&#8217;s thus not worth it for ordinary citizens to get off their
    duffs and fight.</p>
  <p>On top of this, there&#8217;s an even deeper problem. Democracy responds
    at best to voters and at worst to money. Both voters and donors are living
    humans. <strong>Not even seated at democracy&#8217;s table &#8212; not organized,
    not propertied, and not enfranchised &#8212; are future generations, ecosystems,
    and nonhuman species.</strong> James Madison and his brethren could scarcely have
    foreseen this defect. In their day, politics was about the clash between
    living factions, not between living humans and their heirs, or between our
    species and the rest of nature. But that&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
  <p>The implications of Adam Smith&#8217;s quote at the beginning of this chapter
    are thus even graver than he thought. If government&#8217;s inherent bias
    is toward property owners, the losers aren&#8217;t only the poor. <strong>The
    losers are also future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species, none
    of whom
    own any property at all. The only positive news here is that the converse
    might also be true: if future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species
    did own property, they might have some economic and political power.</strong> ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can <strong>preserve shared inheritances</strong>. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like statism conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, privatism connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system.</p>
  <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
    is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take data
    from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and display
    the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
  <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
    a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior of
    the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
    system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The algorithms
    are:<br>
    (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
    (2) distribute property income on a per-share basis, and<br>
    <strong>(3) the price of nature equals zero.</strong><br>
    The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more property
    shares than the remaining 95 percent.</p>
  <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell as
    much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources, and waste
    disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses the minds
    of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake up thinking about
    how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their product, they must
    create some. If they work in finance, they worry about margins and leverage.
    If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain hard, replace long-term
    employees with temps, and shift jobs to places where wages are lower. All
    the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to Wall Street.</p>
  <p>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s the
    combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism to devour
    nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time, nothing in the
    algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either individually or collectively,
    to preserve anything.</p>
  <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think about
    protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving something
    back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for actually doing
    such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does it mean that, from
    time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly flout the corporate
    algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying is that, in the great
    majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and its brethren are obeyed. For
    all practical purposes, the publicly traded corporation is a slave to its
    algorithm. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>A Children&#8217;s Opportunity Trust</p>
  <p>Not long ago, while researching historic documents for this book, I stumbled
    across this sentence in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787: &#8220;[T]he estates,
    both of resident and nonresident proprietors in the said territory, dying
    intestate, shall descent to, and be distributed among their children, and
    the descendants of a deceased child, in equal parts.&#8221; What, I wondered,
    was this about?</p>
  <p>The answer, I soon learned, was primogeniture &#8212; or more precisely,
    ending primogeniture in America. Jefferson, Madison, and other early settlers
    believed the feudal practice of passing all or most property from father
    to eldest son had no place in the New World. This wasn&#8217;t about equal
    rights for women; that notion didn&#8217;t arise until later. Rather, it
    was about leveling the economic playing and avoiding a permanent aristocracy.</p>
  <p>A nation in which everyone owned some property &#8212; in those days, this
    meant land &#8212; was what Jefferson and his contemporaries had in mind.
    In such a society, hard work and merit would be rewarded, while inherited
    privilege would be curbed. This vision of America wasn&#8217;t wild romanticism;
    it seemed quite achievable at the time, given the vast western frontier.
    What thwarted it, later, were giveaways of land to speculators and railroads,
    the rise of monopolies, and the colossal untaxed fortunes of the robber barons.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward to the twenty-first century. Land is no longer the basis for
    most wealth; stock ownership is. But Jefferson&#8217;s vision of an ownership
    society is still achievable. The means for achieving it lies not, as George
    W. Bush has misleadingly argued, in the privatization of Social Security
    and health insurance, but in guaranteeing an inheritance to every child.
    In a country as super-affluent as ours, there&#8217;s absolutely no reason
    why we can&#8217;t do that. (In fact, Great Britain has already done it.
    Every British child born after 2002 gets a trust fund seeded by $440 from
    the government &#8212; $880 for children in the poorest 40 percent of families.
    All interest earned by the trust funds is tax-free.)</p>
  <p>Let me get personal for a minute. My parents weren&#8217;t wealthy; both
    were children of penniless immigrants. They worked hard, saved, and invested &#8212; and
    paid my full tuition at Harvard. Later, they helped me buy a home and start
    a business. Without their financial assistance, I wouldn&#8217;t have achieved
    the success that I have. I, in turn, have set up trust funds for my two sons.
    As I did, they&#8217;ll have money for college educations, buying their own
    homes, and if they choose, starting their own businesses &#8212; in other
    words, what they need to get ahead in a capitalist system.</p>
  <p>As I hope my sons will be, I&#8217;m extremely grateful for my economic
    good fortune. At the same time, I&#8217;m painfully aware that my family&#8217;s
    good fortune is far from universal. Many second-, third-, and even seventh-generation
    Americans have little or no savings to pass on to their heirs. Their children
    may receive their parents&#8217; love and tutelage, but they don&#8217;t
    get the cash needed nowadays for a first-rate education, a down payment on
    a house, or a business venture. A few may rise because of extraordinary talent
    and luck, but the majority will spend their lives on a treadmill, paying
    bills and perhaps tucking a little away for old age. Their sons and daughters,
    in turn, will face a similar future.</p>
  <p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. One can imagine all sorts of government
    programs that can help people advance in life &#8212; free college and graduate
    school, GI bills, housing subsidies, and so on. Such programs, as we know,
    come and go, and I prefer more rather than less of them. But the simplest
    way to help people advance is to give them what my parents gave me, and what
    I&#8217;m giving my sons: a cash inheritance. And the surest way to do that
    is to build such inheritances into our economic operating system, much the
    way Social Security is.</p>
  <p>When Jefferson substituted pursuit of happiness for Locke&#8217;s property,
    he wasn&#8217;t denigrating the importance of property. Without presuming
    to read his mind, I assume he altered Locke&#8217;s wording to make the point
    that property isn&#8217;t an end in itself, but merely a means to the higher
    end of happiness. In fact, the importance he and other Founders placed on
    property can be seen throughout the Constitution and its early amendments.
    Happiness, they evidently thought, may be the ultimate goal, but property
    is darn useful in the pursuit of it.</p>
  <p>If this was true in the eighteenth century, it&#8217;s even truer in the
    twenty-first. The unalienable right to pursue happiness is fairly meaningless
    under capitalism without a chunk of capital to get started.</p>
  <p>And while Social Security provides a cushion for the back end of life, it
    does nothing for the front end. That&#8217;s where we need something new.</p>
  <p>A kitty for the front end of life has to be financed differently than Social
    Security because children can&#8217;t contribute in advance to their own
    inheritances. But the same principle of intergenerational solidarity can
    apply. Consider an intergenerational transfer fund through which departing
    souls leave money not just for their own children, but for all children.
    This could replace the current inheritance tax, which is under assault in
    any case. (As this is written, Congress has temporarily phased out the inheritance
    tax as of 2010; a move is afoot to make the phaseout permanent.) Mind you,
    I think ending the inheritance tax is a terrible idea; it&#8217;s the least
    distorting (in the sense of discouraging economic activity) and most progressive
    tax possible. It also seems sadly ironic that a nation that began by abolishing
    primogeniture is now on the verge of creating a permanent aristocracy of
    wealth. That said, if the inheritance tax is eliminated, an intergenerational
    transfer fund would be a fitting substitute.</p>
  <p>The basic idea is similar to the revenue recycling system of professional
    sports. Winners &#8212; that is, millionaires and billionaires &#8212; would
    put money into a kitty (call it the Children&#8217;s Opportunity Trust),
    to be divided among all children equally, so the next round of economic play
    can be more competitive. In this case, the winners will have had a lifetime
    to enjoy their wealth, rather than just a single season. When they depart,
    half their estates, say, could be passed to their own children, while the
    other half would be distributed among all children. Their own offspring would
    still start on third base, but others would at least be in the game.</p>
  <p>Under this plan, no money would go to the government. Instead, every penny
    would go back into the market, through the bank or brokerage accounts (managed
    by parents) of newborn children. I&#8217;d call these new accounts Individual
    Inheritance Accounts; they&#8217;d be front-of-life counterparts of Individual
    Retirement Accounts. After children turn eighteen, they could withdraw from
    their accounts for further education, a first home purchase, or to start
    a business.</p>
  <p>Yes, contributions to the Children&#8217;s Opportunity Trust would be mandatory,
    at least for estates over a certain size (say $1 or $2 million). But such
    end-of-life gifts to society are entirely appropriate, given that so much
    of a millionaire&#8217;s wealth is, in reality, a gift from society. No one
    has expressed this better than Bill Gates Sr., father of the world&#8217;s
    richest person. &#8220;We live in a place which is orderly. It&#8217;s a
    place where markets work because there&#8217;s legal structure to support
    them. It&#8217;s a place where people can own property and protect it. People
    who have the good fortune, the skill, the luck to become wealthy in our country,
    simply have a debt to the source of their opportunity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>I like the link between end-of-life recycling and start-of-life inheritances
    because it so nicely connects the passing of one generation with the coming
    of another. It also connects those who have received much from society with
    those who have received little; there&#8217;s justice as well as symmetry
    in that.</p>
  <p>To top things off, I like to think that the contributors &#8212; millionaires
    and billionaires all &#8212; will feel less resentful about repaying their
    debts to society if their repayments go directly to children, rather than
    to the Internal Revenue Service. They might think of the Children&#8217;s
    Opportunity Trust as a kind of venture capital fund that makes startup investments
    in American children. A venture capital fund assumes nine out of ten investments
    won&#8217;t pay back, but the tenth will pay back in spades, more than compensating
    for the losers. So with the Children&#8217;s Opportunity Trust. If one out
    of ten children eventually departs this world with an estate large enough
    to &#8220;pay back&#8221; in spades the initial investment, then the trust
    will have earned its keep. And who knows? Some of those paying back might
    even feel good about it. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So far I&#8217;ve focused on the commons of nature and community. In this
    chapter I explore the third fork of the commons river, culture. By this I
    mean the gifts of language, art, and science we inherit, plus the contributions
    we make as we live.</p>
  <p>Culture is a joint undertaking &#8212; a co-production &#8212; of individuals
    and society. The symphonies of Mozart, like the songs of Lennon and McCartney,
    are works of genius. But they also arise from the culture in which that genius
    lives. The instrumentation, the notation system, and the prevalent musical
    forms are the dough from which composers bake their cakes. So too with ideas.
    All thinkers and writers draw on stories and discoveries that have been developed
    by countless men and women before them. To paraphrase Isaac Newton, each
    generation sees a little farther because it stands on the shoulders of its
    predecessors. In this way, all new work draws from the commons and then enriches
    it. To keep art and science flourishing, we have to make sure the cultural
    commons is cared for.</p>
  <p>In addition, unlike most natural commons, the cultural commons is inexhaustible.
    Shakespeare&#8217;s plays can be &#8220;used&#8221; again and again without
    diminishing them. The same is true of Newton&#8217;s theories, Beethoven&#8217;s
    string quartets, and the information on the World Wide Web. Indeed, the more
    we use these assets, the more value they bestow. And thanks to technology &#8212; from
    Gutenberg&#8217;s press to Marconi&#8217;s radio to the globe-spanning Internet &#8212; sharing
    this wealth has become increasingly easy.</p>
  <p>Today, unfortunately, this cultural commons, like the commons of nature
    and community, is being enclosed by private corporations. The danger is that
    corporations will deplete the soil in which culture grows. The remedy is
    to reinvigorate the cultural commons. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
