Ted Gwartney:&nbsp; <a

Land Values</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Adam Smith, in The Wealth of
Nations, suggested that any "tax"
should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
efficiently preformed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
meet:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Light on the
production of wealth, and does not impede
or reduce production; </small>
  <p><small>2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
understand;</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for
corruption,
and provides adequate revenue;</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received,
impartial,
and just.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
land rent is the only revenue
source, or "tax", that meets these criteria. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">As new
inventions and more efficient ways of producing goods are
discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes</span>. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the rent of land is taken for
public purposes production and
distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25%<span

Open Letter to Wayne Swan</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
"Great Australian Dream" now - as
in preceding years - has been to own your own home. </span>From their
earliest years of adulthood, most citizens have attempted to purchase
"a roof over their head." It used to be - no more than two human
generations ago - "a three-bedroom weatherboard - or brick veneer, if
you could afford it! - on a quarter-acre block in the suburbs." Most
citizens - then - succeeded in realising that dream; at least they
started repaying a loan that was large compared with their earnings.
Nowadays, it's quite impossible for most. Why? Simply because
land-price has escalated out of the reach of most. Allow me to give you
a specific instance:-</small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1962, my wife-to-be and I signed a contract to purchase a
block of
land in Noble Park, a suburb 27 km south east from Melbourne's CBD. It
was a bit less than a quarter acre, quite large even by the standards
of the time. (Nowadays, it's considered enormous!) It cost us 1,200
pounds; that is, $2,400. At that time, I was employed as a Class 1
Engineer; the lowest level of engineer having a tertiary-level
qualification. My wife was a full-time housewife and mother earning a
little from some hairdressing work at home. My wife and I still occupy
the home that was built on that block in 1965 then extended in 1974 and
again in 1980. There are almost no vacant blocks left in Noble Park now
but I have been informed - by local real-estate agents - that our block
would bring at least $160,000 if unimproved because it is large enough
for four
single-level home-units! A comparison in $ terms conveys very little
information due to inflation and changes in taxation but the following
should overcome that difficulty:- </small><br>
<br>
<small>The price we paid for the block back in 1962 was exactly equal
to my
gross pay during that year; in other words, the block of land cost the
same as the services of a Class 1 Engineer for one year. (The income
tax I paid that year - I still have a copy of the income tax return! -
was almost exactly 150 pounds; that is, 12.5% of my gross pay. It's
interesting to note that the highest rate of income tax that applied
then was 13/4 - thirteen shillings and fourpence - in the pound; that
is, 66.67% of gross pay.) Nowadays, a Class 1 Engineer receives a
starting salary of about $40,000 per year. Given that the same block of
land would now cost $160,000 - that is, four years' gross pay! - it's
not surprising that most couples are finding it increasingly difficult
to own their own residence.&nbsp; Even the cheapest blocks in "suburbs"
like Pakenham - about 60 km south east of Melbourne's CBD - cost around
$60,000. (Please note that the income tax payable nowadays on $40,000
is about $9,460; that is, 23.65% of gross pay yet the maximum rate at
which income tax is now levied is only 48.5%. Additionally, way back in
1962, sales tax was applied to a very narrow range of goods and to no
services. Nowadays, GST applies to a very wide range of both goods and
services. Clearly, citizens are far more taxed now than they were.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>As you can very clearly see, it now costs couples - or singles -
a
great deal more to own a residence. Naturally, if they don't own their
own residence, they must </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>pay rent to somebody else ... or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>live in a caravan park or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>share a home with relatives or friends or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>have no place to call "home".&nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">None
of these alternatives lead to a
high quality lifestyle and undoubtedly are potent factors in separation
and divorce and reliance on drug abuse which, itself, leads to
anti-social - even criminal - behaviour. </span>We also know to our
great regret that these aberrations are becoming increasingly
prevalent. So is there a solution? And if so, what is it? </small><br>
<br>
<small>In my opinion, there certainly is a solution ... but, seemingly,
very
few want to know it. Judging by your article, I think you do. Here it

of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html"><br>
</a></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VII. Economic Growth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recognition of the equal rights of
all to natural opportunities,
through land value taxation and its extension to charges for the use
of other resources, is not only just and efficient, but has the
capacity to make a major contribution to economic growth. This occurs
through a variety of paths.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most important path is that
public collection of the value of
exclusive use of natural opportunities provides revenue that makes it
possible to remove taxes from the earnings of labor and capital. When
people are taxed less, they earn more. Using data that emerged from
changes in U.S. tax rates, Feldstein has estimated that the
elasticity of earnings with respect to the fraction of income not
taken at the margin by federal taxes is at least 1.0 (and more for
workers in higher tax
brackets).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>6</i></b></small></font> When
the entity that
removes a tax on labor is less than global, this action also attract
labor to the region.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When taxes are removed from
capital, the effect is even more
powerful, as long as the entity removing the tax is less than global.
Capital is extremely mobile in response to regional changes in net
returns. It is highly counterproductive for any locality or nation to
tax capital, because there will be virtually no effect on the return
to capital after taxes. Capital will merely be driven from the taxed
region until the return after taxes matches what can be obtained
elsewhere. If the whole world removes taxes from capital, the
resulting increase in the rate of return to capital will increase the
rate of saving, but the adjustment will occur over some years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land has an additional
effect that increases the stock of
capital. A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults
to the young and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land.
Unless there is a perfectly offsetting reduction in the desire to
accumulate assets to transfer to the next generation, this
redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer assets, to
accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land also increases the
efficiency with which land is used.
This occurs through three paths.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land
speculation, and therefore reduces the quantity of land speculation. </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling
price of land, the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the
annual tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land
relatively more attractive to bidders with high discount rates and
relatively less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the
extent that the former are more entrepreneurial and the latter more
passive investors, land will tend to flow into the hands of persons who
will choose to use it more intensively. </small></li>
  <li><small>The third path by which a tax on land increases the
efficiency with which land is used is that, for those who are using
land inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an
implicit one (the income foregone by inefficient use). </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Psychologically, explicit costs
tend to be more effective in
motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VIII. An Estimate
of the Magnitudes of the Consequences of Taxing Land</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For all of the above reasons, the
substitution of tax on land for
taxes on labor and capital will increase the efficiency of an
economy. To estimate the magnitudes of these consequences, one needs
a model of the economy. Consider the following model. There is a
three-factor CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production
function:</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Q = (aT&agrave; + bL&agrave; +
cK&agrave;)(1/&agrave;). (1)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>where Q is output, T is the
quantity of land, L is the quantity of
labor, K is the quantity of capital, a, b and c are coefficients, and
&agrave; is related to the elasticity of substitution, &aring;, by
&agrave; = 1 - 1/&aring;. Land has a completely fixed supply. Labor
is assumed to have an elasticity of supply of 0.8 (adjusting
Feldstein's number for the fact that he was considering only federal
income taxes. Capital is assumed to be supplied perfectly
elastically. Taking the ratio of compensation of employees to Net
Domestic Product in National Income and Product Accounts, I assume
that labor receives two thirds of output. Somewhat arbitrarily, I
assume that the remaining third is divided equally between land and
capital. I estimate that the marginal tax rate on labor is 43% (28%
for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state income
taxes indirect taxes, and 3% for the Medicare tax--I treat social
security as having benefits equal to its costs, and therefore not a
tax.) I estimate the marginal tax rate on land and capital at 50%
(28% for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state
income taxes and indirect taxes, plus 10% for profits taxes). The
elasticity of substitution is a parameter that I am very unsure of.
But Feldstein has estimated that the marginal welfare cost of
taxation is 1.65, and I get that result with a &aring; of 0.68, so I
assume that &aring; = 0.68.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I have a spreadsheet that takes
parameters such as the ones
named and determines what would happen (in a comparative static
framework) if all taxes were removed from labor and capital, and 100%
of the rent of land were taxed. Here are the results:

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

labor would increase by 55%.

  <li><small>Output would increase by 53%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The wage before taxes would
fall by 1.7%, but the wage after taxes would increase by 72%.

  <li><small>The

enough revenue for all existing expenditures of all levels of
government in the U.S., other than social security.

Recessions (and depressions) may occur when there are massive shocks to
the system (e.g., the OPEC producers withholding supplies and doubling
and tripling prices of a commodity that could not be readily
substituted for). Recessions may also be prolonged and accelerated by
unwise public policy choices made by people who have no idea of the
consequences of their actions or inactions. Now, in the activist area
where I am working, there is still a strong cry for a Constitutional
amendment to balance the U.S. Federal budget. Some of the economists in
and out of government are saying this would be a disaster, using the
same sort of "if GDP is growing, don't worry be happy" pronouncement
you refer to above. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When GDP is
adjusted for the dollars spent on the criminal justice system and
clean-up costs for preventable environmental disasters, then I might
have some faith in this as a bellwether of wellbeing. </span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>
As for the coming "boom," I simply repeat my observation that there is
no U.S. economy; there are only regional economies competing with one
another as well as with other nations. We have the beginnings of
speculative booms in some places, stability in others, and continuing
recessions in others. People who cannot sell their houses because they
owe more on them than they are worth cannot take their services
elsewhere to seek employment. So much for the mobility of the labour
force. This is one of the unfortunate sides of the American dream of
home ownership; when a lease expires, one simply does not renew.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Only around 25-30% of households own their own homes. By good fortune,
I just read something that helps resolve the difficulty. It seems that
a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive Era had
been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas A.
Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure
inventor. Much of this legislation became unravelled under President -
guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and
political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and
monopolization then ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has
played a role in this. Disney as real estate developer throws its heavy
weight around brutally.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and what it
would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers,
monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after
all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive Movements. </small><br>
<br>
<small>
"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform. Some
of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
and workers.</small><br>
<small>
&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>
Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs in
the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the
device of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive
privilege, it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting
abuses of power. <a

<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span

because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for

<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing Land is Better Than
Neutral</span></small><br>
<small>The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;,
that
is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.</small><br>
<br>
<small>First, a land tax can be used to take account of positive and
negative
externalities associa&shy;ted with land use.&nbsp; The typical example
of a negative externality is pollution.&nbsp; If labor and capital were
perfectly mobile, then the effect of pollution on near-by locations
would be reflected entirely in land values.&nbsp; Thus one might say
that a polluter &#8216;uses&#8217; surrounding land and should pay for that use in
the form of a &#8216;land tax&#8217; equal to the reduction in the rental value of
land that results from his activities.&nbsp; Such a land tax would not
only raise govern&shy;ment revenue, but would also improve efficiency
by ensuring that people would engage in activities that pro&shy;duced
pollution only when the benefits of those activities exceeded the costs.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Because labor and capital are not perfectly mobile, pollution
affects
not only land values, but also the value of structures and the net
well-being that people experience from the opportunity to continue to
live in accustomed places.&nbsp; Efficient management of pollution
would charge polluters for these costs as well.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When there is traffic congestion on city streets or on highways,
bridges, or tunnels, one might say that there is a problem caused by
people not being charged adequately for the use of particu&shy;larly
valuable space.&nbsp; If there is a congestion charge (land tax) that
reflects the extent to which any one user of streets and highways
imposes costs on other users in the form of increased travel times,
then that congestion charge improves efficiency while also raising
government revenue. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The index of consumption is not an index of well-being, because
it does
not take account of the additional saving that people do.&nbsp; To
obtain a measure of the annual improvement in the well-being of
citizens that comes from shifting as much tax as possible to land, I
take the increase in saving and add or subtract the amount necessary to
compensate for the change in the consumption index.&nbsp; The result is
a concept known in economics as the &#8220;Hicks equivalent variation.&#8221;&nbsp;
It reveals the amount of money that people would need to be given to
make them as well off as under a contemplated change.&nbsp; This is
shown if Figure 10.&nbsp; In the closed economy, the net gain per
worker from shifting as much tax as possible to land starts out at
about $10,200 per year and rises to about $19,000 per year after 25
years.&nbsp; In the open economy it starts out at about $12,500 per
year and rises to $40,400 per year after 25 years. ...&nbsp; <a

  <p>Rawls manages to retain the primacy of egalitarianism without destroying
    all incentives to be productive by the maximin rule: <b>Laws should be designed
    to maximize the well-being of the least
advantaged person.</b> This formulation, however, generates such anomalies as
the following: If there are three persons, and the choice is either a distribution
of $10,000, $12,000 and $50,0000, or a distribution of $10,001, $10,002 and $80,000,
the <i>maximin</i> rule will select the latter, despite the fact that it makes
the middle income person, who is already relatively poor, even poorer while making
the richest person noticeably richer. In Rawls's particular formulation there
is a further difficulty. He makes the <i>maximin</i> rule lexically subordinate
to the rule that all persons should have the maximum individual liberty that
all can have. However, he does not deal with the following problem: My individual
liberty will be unnecessarily restricted if I am not allowed to sing you a song
in exchange for a haircut (without being taxed), but if I am allowed to do so
without being taxed, the maximin rule is not satisfied. If Rawls really does
mean to put individual liberty lexically first, no redistributive income taxes
would be
permitted. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of
  Taxation: The Local Case</a></p>
  <p>Consider first the question of adequacy of revenue. There is a theorem in
    economics, known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Henry George Theorem</span>, that addresses this question (Arnott and Stiglitz,
1979). One of the
simpler versions of this theorem is: </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the following three conditions are met:</p>
  <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Public expenditures provide benefits
      only over a limited area, <br>
    2. People can move costlessly, and <br>
    3. The number of persons who value a public service as highly as anyone does
    exceeds the number of persons who can live in the area where the service
    provides benefits,</blockquote>
    then for any public service that is worth at least as much as it costs to
    those who receive it, the increase in the rental value of land that results
    from providing the service exceeds the net cost of the service.</div>
  <p>The Henry George Theorem is true because people who can move costlessly
    will bid up the rental value of land to reflect the value of public services
    that are not available elsewhere. The assumption that the number of bidders
    exceeds the number of people who can benefit from the public service guarantees
    that the upward movement of rents will not end until all the benefits of
    the public service are reflected in these rents. If some people who receive
    a public service value it more highly than others, then they will receive
    a surplus in addition to the rent they pay for land, and some worthwhile
    increments of public services will not add quite enough to rent to pay for
    themselves (Tideman 1993). But rent increments will go a very long way toward
    paying for worthwhile local public services.</p>
  <p>With some local public services, such as weather reports that are broadcasted
    by radio at a specified wattage, there is no social cost of having another
    person within the reception area use the service. With others, such as distribution
    of water, the extra cost of one additional user will be noticeable, but still
    a relatively small fraction of the average cost of the service. For public
    services to provide the greatest possible net value, users must be charged
    the costs of additional use (what economists call marginal cost). If they
    are charged less than marginal cost, self-interest will motivate them to
    use the service wastefully. And if they are charged more than marginal cost,
    self-interest will motivate them to economize inefficiently on the service. </p>
  <p><b>Thus local public services are financed efficiently when users are required
      to pay marginal costs, and the component of total cost that is not covered
      by marginal cost charges is financed by levies on land that collect the
      increases in rental value of land that result from provision of the service.</b> If
      all citizens in a locality valued the service equally, then every increment
      in the level of the service that was worthwhile would have a cost that
      was less than or equal to the sum of the revenue that could be raised from
      charges for use equal to marginal cost and the increase in the rental value
      of land in the community that resulted from the availability of the service.
      When people value the service differently, the increase in the rental value
      of land that results from the provision of a service will be less than
      the value of the service to those who receive it. By a criterion of maximizing
      the real incomes of residents, the best outcome that covers the full cost
      of a service will involve a level of service somewhat lower than that for
      which marginal cost is equal to the sum of marginal benefits, along with
      charges that exceed somewhat the marginal cost of providing the service
      to additional persons. Still, in general, the combination of user fees
      approximately equal to marginal cost and taxes on land to finance the remainder
      of costs is capable of providing financing for local public services that
      is adequate and reasonably efficient.</p>
  <p><b>Next consider fairness.</b> The fairness of such financing is the fairness
    of incremental decisions in an environment in which the initial allocation
    is fair. (It does not provide special opportunities for disadvantaged persons.
    They would need to be provided for by insurance that operated independently
    of the provision of public goods.) A person who is treated fairly in the
    absence of public goods cannot reasonably complain about being required to
    pay for a service according to its marginal cost, or about have to pay the
    value that is added to his land by the availability of a public service.</p>
  <p>In the latter case, there is an argument that must be answered. A person
    may say, "It is true that the provision of this public service adds as much
    to the rental value of my land as I am being taxed, but that is what the
    service is worth to someone else who might use my land. It's not worth that
    to me. In fact, the 'service' reduces my
well-being." </p>
  <p>Here we have a difficulty. We have no way of identifying the value of a
    service that is provided to a person without his request. If we express a
    willingness to respond to such statements, people will have a motive for
    faking a lack of interest in the service in order to reduce their tax bills.
    If a person can point to some characteristic of his circumstances that would
    tend to support the claim that he does not value the service (for example,
    if the service is concerts in the park and the person is deaf, or if the
    services is a sewer line and the person just put in a new septic system),
    then we may have an obligation to compensate the person for raising his taxes
    to pay for something that he does not value. But when the person can point
    to no such special circumstances, he should bear the cost. People should
    understand that one of the risks of moving into a community is that their
    fellow citizens may decide to provide a local public service that most people
    value but they do not. At worst, the aggrieved person will have to bear the
    costs of moving (including the psychological costs). Thus if any compensation
    is offered to people who have characteristics that suggest that they do not
    value a public service that raises the value of their land, the compensation
    that they receive should have an upper limit of the loss in the value of
    things attached to the land (the septic system) plus the financial and psychological
    costs of moving. While we need to watch out for fakers, these are real costs,
    and a public service is only worthwhile if its benefits exceed its full costs,
    including losses in the value of capital and in the human satisfaction of
    those who did not want change. </p>
  <p>The fairness of such a tax system might also be questioned from another
    perspective. If people are required to pay the costs of the public services
    that they use, then who will pay for schools?</p>
  <p>There are two possible answers. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One possibility is that people will agree on the value of living in a
      community where children are well educated, whether they have children
      or not, and they will find the presence of another child in the community
      to be a benefit for which the cost of educating the child is not too high
      a price to pay. In this case, educational expenditures add to the value
      of land throughout the community, and education can be financed efficiently
      by land taxes, without requiring students or their parents to pay. Those
      who pay will be receiving benefits that are equal to what they pay. </li>
    <li>The second possibility is that there will be a consensus that, whether
      anyone wants to pay or not, education is a birthright of all children.
      In this case, the birthright can be financed efficiently by a tax on land,
      since land does not leave town or work less hard when it is taxed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But is such a tax fair? Consider first a case in which everyone has the
    same number of children. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">read
