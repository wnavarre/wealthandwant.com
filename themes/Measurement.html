Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><big>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.</big><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.

<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS MISSING
FROM THE CAPITAL GAINS DEBATE?</span></small><br>
<small>The most frequently
heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span> </small><br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span> </small><br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small><font size="-1">14 Some argue that
eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate
cut. See Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 2 1; Gaffney (1991).<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock
market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Typical of the campaign to reduce capital gains taxes is a Wall
Street
Journal editorial, &#8220;Capital Gains: Lift the Burden.&#8221; Author W. Kurt
Hauser argues that when the capital gains tax rate was increased from
20 percent to 28 percent in 1989, the effect was to deter asset sales,
causing a decline in the capital gains to be reaped and taxed. He
refers, however, only to stock market gains, and specifically, to
equity in small businesses. Citing the example of yacht producers, he
suggests that taxing capital gains on stocks issued by these businesses
&#8220;locks in&#8221; capital asset sales, thereby deterring new investment and
hiring, and reducing the supply of yachts.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Others contend that new productive investment is relatively
insensitive
to capital gains tax rates, arguing, for example, that most of the
money placed in venture-capital funds come from tax-exempt pension
funds, endowments, and foundations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17 </span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What
is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate.<small>18</small></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><small></small></span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">18 Federal Reserve Board,
Flow-of-Funds Statistics, Balance
Sheets for the US Economy. See <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/studies/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html#5._Government_Statistics_on_Real_Estate">section
5 </a>regarding capital gains on
land and buildings.</font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>The
Federal Reserve Board estimates land values at some $4.4
trillion for 1994. Residential structures add $5.9 trillion, and other
buildings another $3.1 trillion. This $13.4 trillion of real estate
value represents two thirds of the total $20 trillion in overall assets
for the United States economy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> Real
estate accounts for three-fourths of the economy's capital consumption
allowances. It also is the major collateral for debt, and generates
some two-thirds of the interest paid by American businesses. Real
estate taxes are the economy's major wealth tax, although their yield
has declined as a proportion of all state and local revenues, from 70
percent in 1930 to about one-fourth today.</small><small><small><br>
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital gains statistics are
much harder to come by. One cannot simply
measure the increased value of the capital stock, for part of the rise
represents investment--production of new capital -- rather than
appreciation of existing capital and land. The IRS conducts periodic
sampling of capital gains based on tax returns, and its Statistics on
Income presents various analyses of the shares of total capital gains
reported by the economy's income cohorts, from the richest five percent
down. The samples are admittedly asymmetrical, however, and some of the
categories overlap. Significantly, for instance, stock market gains
include a large component of land and other real estate gains. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in
the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
central conclusion of our study is
that better statistics on asset
values and capital gains are needed -- or, more to the point, a better
accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
upon how the gains are made.<br>
<br>
</span>The measurement problem is exacerbated by assessment bias in
many
states and localities. Particularly where land values are trending
upward, overestimates of building values relative to site values
reflect the steady under-assessment of land. Note that as a larger
share of real estate value is imputed to buildings, a larger share of
cash flow can be claimed as depreciation. In effect, assessment bias
allows investors to partly depreciate land, at no cost to local
government budgets.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>Official statistics should provide a sense of proportion as to
how the
economy works. Especially when it comes to real estate, however,
national income statistics tend to obfuscate more than they reveal.
They are the product of income-tax filings, and hence are distorted for
both administrative and political reasons; they do not reflect
fundamental categories of economic analysis. One searches in vain, for
example, for an estimate of the distribution of total income among
land, labor, and capital, or for an accounting of how rentier claims on
revenue and output are layered upon directly productive
enterprise.&nbsp; </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span

Walt Rybeck: <a
 href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What
Affordable Housing Problem?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the 1980s, Washington, D.C.,
was concerned about its growing army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a
year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a
year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building
rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why do those statistics not seem
to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of
their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of
their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look
Out Below</span></small><br>
<small>The answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not
mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast to those 11- to
14-percent
annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three decades. </span>To
cite a few state examples, residential land prices in 30 years rose
1501 percent in Maryland, 1737 percent in Texas, 2806 percent in New
Hampshire. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>[1] It's been suggested
that
this study of housing and land prices be
updated, but it would be almost impossible to duplicate now. It relied
in large part on the data-rich Census of Government studies begun in
the 1950s and continued every five years, showing taxable property
values of land and buildings nationwide and in every state. The
administration of President Reagan (his funeral oratory might almost
excuse one for calling him Saint Reagan) killed this Census Bureau
series. Reagan's team also erased years of my own work under
Congressman Henry S. Reuss of Milwaukee to create a national land price
index. Certain landholding interests apparently want to keep the public
in the dark about the behavior of land and housing markets.</small></small><small>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p>Although one can infer innumerable instances where economic rent inheres
    in land factors, the econometric data maintained by public agencies has not
    been compiled in a way that makes it easily identifiable. In fact the US
    Census of Housing ceased to keep records on the assessed value of land in
    1987, reasoning that the quality was so poor that it was more misleading
    than it was helpful. The actual account of the &quot;rental income of persons&quot; in
    the US government National Income and Product Accounts is estimated at less
    than 2%,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> yet this figure
    is widely acknowledged to be so unrealistic an estimate that it is ludicrous
    by itself. What studies have been performed to calculate economic rent suggest
    that the amount for real property alone is in the neighborhood of 30 percent
    of a nation's GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> This
    realm of research begs for attention, but it will not likely be more than
    approximate as long as government statistics are so lacking and unreliable.

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html">The
Merits of Site Value Taxation</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The place to start is taking
advantage of what economists and tax
theorists have learned over the course of the past three hundred years
about a government's role in the economy. Far from assuming that the
economy works best by a total "hands-off" policy as Adam Smith was
falsely believed to have advocated by his invocation of an "invisible
hand," policy leaders need to recognize that<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> certain values we hold
dear are outside the economy, and are threatened by our failure to
price them properly. That we treat certain goods and "services" in
nature as "free" means that we overuse them and our environment is
degraded.</span> Clean water and air, for example, aren't given any
value in
our economic system, and when they are degraded by agricultural runoff,
industrial pollutants, or auto-emissions, those who are "using up"
these resources go untaxed. The notion that the economy is a
self-regulating system, operating according to defined laws and in
ongoing equilibrium, is no longer entertained by serious students of
economic and fiscal policy. The debate rather is over which government
interventions are constructive and which ones are dysfunctional. The
best place to start correcting property tax inequities and
environmental degradation is by the right kind of taxes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Tax theorists evaluate revenue structures according to the
criteria of
economic neutrality, efficiency, equity, administrability, simplicity,
stability, and sufficiency. ... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html"><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of assessors' greatest
problems today is the strong pressures
from owners who want to allocate as much value as possible to
buildings that they may depreciate for federal income tax purposes.
Here is where we must study how the parts form the big picture. Here
is where federal and local tax policies intersect. Some Georgists
have neglected or misunderstood the income-tax treatment of land
income. Let us see how this works.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Congress and the IRS let one
depreciate buildings, but not land,
for income tax. This important distinction harks back to when the
income tax was new, and Georgist Congressmen like Warren Worth
Bailey, from Johnstown, PA and Henry George Jr., from Brooklyn were
instrumental in shaping it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a building is new, the
depreciable value is limited to the
cost of construction. The non-depreciable land is the bare land value
before construction. So far, so good. Over time, however, building
owners have converted this into a tax shelter scheme. Owner A, the
builder, writes off the building in a few years, much less than its
economic life, and sells it to B. "A" pays a tax on the excess of
sales price over "basis." The basis is reduced by all depreciation
taken, so any excess depreciation is "recaptured" upon sale. It is
defined by Congress as a "capital gain," and given the corresponding
package of tax preferences:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>deferral of tax,</small></li>
  <li><small>lower rate,</small></li>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus far, any tax preference goes
to A, the builder, and may be
seen as a wellconsidered building incentive. Watch, however, what
happens next. "A" sells to B and B depreciates the building all over
again, from his purchase price. To do so, B must allocate the new
"basis" - i.e., his purchase price - between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How shall B allocate the new
basis? Enter the local tax assessor.
Here is where local assessment intersects with Federal income tax
policy. The IRS does not try to assess land and buildings. Instead,
IRS instructions tell taxpayers they may use locally assessed values
to allocate basis between depreciable buildings and non-depreciable
land. The IRS accepts this allocation as conclusive. As a result,
local owners of income property press their assessors to allocate as
much value as possible to buildings, and as little as possible to
land. This does not affect their local taxes, but lowers their
federal taxes. It lets them depreciate land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>Local revenues
are not immediately affected. Local assessors have
little reason not to accommodate their constituents, local
landowners, to help them depreciate land for federal and state income
tax purposes. They have little reason to use the correct
"building-residual'' method of allocating value, and a compelling
reason to use the wrong method that understates land value. Thus they
convert non-depreciable land value into depreciable building value.
It is the modern version of "competitive underassessment." In the
process, they also convert the local property tax from a land tax
into a building tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After a while B sells to C, who in
turn sells to D, so each
building is depreciated many times. So is a large part of the land
under it, tame after time, although it should not be depreciated at
all. This is carried so far that real estate pays no federal or state
income taxes at all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution to this lies with the
U.S. Congress. The need is to
limit depreciation to one cycle only. It is a most urgent problem for
both federal and local treasuries. We all have Congressmen. Write to
them and raise their consciousness. They are brokers who respond to
public opinion. It is we who are derelict.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <a

Capacity of Land </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
The taxable capacity of land is camouflaged in our times by a
consistent modern tendency to underassess it, relative to buildings.
There are several studies in point. The most general one is the
quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It actually
understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of land most
underassessed, that is, raw acreage in and near cities. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that

unwise public policy choices made by people who have no idea of the

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"Statistics
are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal
is vital."</span> - Aaron Levenstein
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Part of the reason we're being misled and confused by economics
is due
to the way it's being expressed, and particularly the statistical
methods of summarising economic performance. Thankfully, the
environmental movement has done much in recent years to expose
governmental fraud in window-dressing statistics to misrepresent
economic performance.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The main cause behind the skewing of statistics is the failure
to
properly take into account natural resources. There's a huge wealth of
"natural capital" that we can either preserve or run down, but
conventional economic statistics never measure the contents of this
vital storehouse. Our economic guardians prefer to look at their
measures of income and expenditure, and largely exclude the balance
sheet side of the ledger. In other words, measures of national income
fail to account for whether our natural resources are being preserved
or run down.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BEANCOUNTERS IN CHARGE</span></small><br>
<small>Accountants rule! Nowadays, income is just assumed to equate to
human
well-being, and what nonsensical activities are measured to reflect
income! It will reportedly increase if, for example:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We build more jails (no matter what the levels of crime)</small></li>
  <li><small>More people are hurt or killed in car accidents (which
results in a sort of economic activity)</small></li>
  <li><small>A priceless forest is clear-felled thus "creating jobs"</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And what wealth is being
ignored? - our storehouse of minerals, oil,
topsoil, ozone shield, fish, forests, biodiversity, clean air and
water, urban parkland, stable climate etc. The consequence is that our
highly-paid professional statisticians and economists tell us that
we're achieving (their calculation of) positive economic growth while
completely ignoring how such natural resources might be plundered on a
wholly unsustainable basis. Geonomics would instead provide the
statistical and qualitative data that would greatly assist us to better
measure, guard and preserve our natural resources, as well as
collecting resource rents from those to whom access to such resources
has been granted. The very nature of Geonomics concerns itself with
this sort of valuation and resource rental. That is why so many robber
barons fought to suppress Henry George's work, supplanting Geonomics
with conventional, academically driven economics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">FUDGED FIGURES</span></small><br>
<small>Many of us are aware of how unemployment figures are fudged to
understate real levels of unemployment and underemployment. Deliberate
falsifications also occur with that other important economic indicator,
the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 1998 the federal government directed
the Australian Bureau of Statistics to remove three very significant
components of the CPI that had been escalating alarmingly, namely:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Consumer credit charges</small></li>
  <li><small>Mortgage interest charges</small></li>
  <li><small>The cost of the land component of new home purchases</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">So
if you think you're working harder but getting less for your efforts,
don't swallow government claims to the contrary!</span> One important
indicator that cannot be fudged is the rarely-publicised, declining
percentage of Australian homeowners.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A NATURAL PARTNERSHIP</span></small><br>
<small>Geonomics can work hand-in-glove with some excellent alternative
indexes of well-being, most notably the GPI (Genuine Progress
Indicator). This seeks to take into account the level and health of our
natural resources as well as qualitative factors such as health of the
population, crime rate, quality of education, drug dependency, cultural
integrity and/or diversity, artistic accomplishment, and so on. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Up
until now, our statisticians have applied a rule that says, "If it
hasn't got a $ sign in front of it, we can't measure it" (and
therefore, for all intents and purposes, it does not exist).</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Is it any surprise that the GPI actually shows a decline in
Australia and the USA over the last 30 years?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The failure to properly examine the nature of land has even led
our
bean counters astray with their captivating accounting standards.
Accountants go to all sorts of lengths to count and properly value
every last bean, but when it comes to land, guess what? Even though
land is often the biggest balance sheet item, it is traditionally
valued at "historical cost" (i.e. at the dollar figure for which the
land was purchased). There are few legal requirements to perform
regular revaluations of land, which often results in a grossly
understated reporting of a company's net worth. For those with inside
knowledge, this practice presents them with exclusive information on
which they can capitalise (at others' expense) in share trading. Of
course, such valuation problems could not exist with Geonomics.</small><br>

in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,
for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96)&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of rent is huge. Every
economy produces a
large excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some
of it goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not
part of the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return
of capital.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Second, some goes as a return to
capital, over replacement.
This is pure income. Income to capital is not a taxable surplus, but
a functional incentive: it moves people to form and supply capital.
This entails securing new capital (by saving, and borrowing) and
conserving old capital (avoiding dissaving, and avoiding export of
capital).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Capital income serves another
useful function: it steers
capital into the most productive uses. Steering capital to its best
uses has the same useful function as securing new capital, and
conserving old. Using capital effectively is as beneficial as
securing more capital, and ever so much cheaper. The Great Transition
in Russia now is learning to allow income on capital, to secure these
benefits. The trick is to do it without allowing more than is
needed.</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The rest of
the excess over wages is captured in the rent of
land. It is a true taxable surplus. The amount is already huge, and
will become huger yet when existing taxes are abated.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> The size of
rent is not reported in capitalist nations,
except to trivialize it. Their national accountants, dominated by
landowners, neglect or conceal it artfully, to protect it from being
taxed.</span> Local governments do, however, measure and tax property
by
value. More than half the value of property is land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In Vancouver,
B.C., 73% of the value of all property assessed for taxation is land,
even though much land there is exempt from tax, and not assessed at
all. In California's major cities it would be just as high if only we
assessed land here as accurately as they do there.&nbsp; </span></small><small>...

<small>SUMMARY&nbsp; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain."
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually
a "land gain," that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Over the past 40 years I have
specialised in the study of the
factors that raise or lower the nation's overall real estate prices
-- rising income and savings levels, shifting interest rates and the
financial sector's supply of mortgage credit, as well as changes in
the tax laws and related market-shaping rules. This work for Wall
Street banks and institutional investors was burdened by the absence
of reliable data on the value of land and buildings. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The official
nationwide real estate statistics do suggest that a politically
motivated asymmetry is at work in the economy, benefiting real
estate,</span> which I shall now attempt to identify.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">f it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>uniform</i></b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>homogeneous</i></b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE DRIVING FORCE behind the
anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For many years Federal Reserve Board in its Flow-of-Funds,
Balance
Sheet of the U.S. Economy, broke down its estimates of economy-wide
real estate values between land and buildings. The problem arose when
the Fed discovered that its methodology produced nonsensical results
-- a negative value of $4 billion for all land owned by non-financial
corporations in 1993. This number resulted from imputing land values
by subtracting the estimated replacement cost of buildings from
overall property market prices. The "land residual" method left
little room for land value, as replacement values continued to rise
even when market prices were declining. In such downturns the
calculated replacement value absorbed nearly all the market value of
corporately owned real estate.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Increases in property values were
explained as construction cost
increases, original cost times the annual rise in the Commerce
Department's construction price index, typically 3 percent. Its
tendency to rise steadily appears to explain the rise in property
values by wage inflation and rising costs of materials. On this logic
real estate prices seem merely to keep up with inflation. There is no
hint of unearned gains or a free lunch.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>SUMMARY</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New

fundamentalists). Lands in classified uses are assessed by capitalizing
their visible money income from the official use only, thus exempting
from the tax base all values from rustic manorial, recreational, and

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">b. Use of IRS data on
reported rents</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; Many
economists rely on data generated by the IRS, taken from tax returns,
to tell them the sources of income in the U.S. This is an exercise in
crediting bad data. The standard tax procedure of landlords is to
deduct alleged &#8220;depreciation&#8221; from their net operating rents (&#8220;cash
flow&#8221;) to arrive at taxable rents. They accelerate depreciation enough,
usually, to report little or no taxable rent. This is what the IRS then
aggregates and reports as the sum of all rents. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To accept such fiction
as fact is inexcusable, but economists do it anyway. </span>Their
credulity
lends their authority to the IRS, while the IRS &#8220;official&#8221; status helps
legitimize the economists -- mutual validation of mutual error, the
curse of science.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; When
owner A has exhausted his tax &#8220;basis&#8221; by overdepreciating, he sells to
B for a price well above the remaining basis. B then depreciates the
same building all over again, then sells to C, who sells to D, and so
on, so each building is tax-depreciated several times during its
economic life. In any given year, most income properties in the U.S.A.
are being tax-depreciated, even though most have already been
depreciated once or more.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; In
addition, all owners after the original builder are in a position to
depreciate some of the land value, as well. This is because the owners
control the &#8220;allocation of basis&#8221; between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land. The IRS has no defense against secondary owners
who overallocate value to the depreciable building. Congress has never
authorized the IRS to develop any in-house capacity to value land. The
most the agency does, if it will not accept the word of the tax filer,
is to look at allocations used by local assessors. These parties, in
turn (with a few notable exceptions), underassess land relative to
buildings, by using the erroneous &#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of dividing
land from building value. This is partly to accommodate their local
constituents - assessors are locally elected or appointed, and do not
report to the IRS. A little math will tell you that to depreciate land
just once is to achieve perpetual tax exemption. To depreciate it again
and again is a continuing subsidy for holding land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When
A sells to B there is a large excess of the sales price over the
remaining or &#8220;undepreciated&#8221; basis. This excess is, to be sure, taxable
income. However, Congress has defined this kind of income as a &#8220;capital
gain.&#8221; Most rents, therefore, show up as capital gains. These, in turn,
are subject to lower tax rates, deferral of tax, forgiveness at time of
death, constant pressure to lower rates to zero, and a dozen additional
avoidance devices. These are known to every lawyer and accountant and
Congressman, but not, apparently, to most economists, who lazily report
from &#8220;official&#8221; data that rents are a low fraction of national income.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;In
addition, the IRS reports nothing at all for the imputed income of
owner-occupied lands, because this kind of non-cash income is not
taxable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Todd Sinai and Joseph Gyourko
of the Wharton School report
aggregate owner-occupied &#8220;house&#8221; values in the U.S. in 1999 were $11.1
trillions. The annual rental value of that, figuring at 5%, would be
roughly half a trillion dollars a year</span> -- quite a chunk to omit
from the
rental portion of national income. We also know that the prices of
lands for both housing and recreation have risen sharply since 1999,
perhaps by 50% or so, so that $11.1 trillion may be $16.7 trillion now.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">That means that the imputed rent
income is 50% higher than half a
trillion (i.e. &frac34; trillion dollars), and also that the net worth
of the owners has risen by about $5.6 trillion. Such silent gains are
also a form of income from land. </span>To all that, many economists
remain
blind, dumb, and curiously incurious.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Sinai and Gyourko&#8217;s treatment is superior to what one usually sees,
with some effort made to treat land separately. However, even they,
like others, write of the imputed income of owner-occupied &#8220;housing,&#8221;
exclusively. That is doubly misleading. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, it emphasizes the
house,
the building, de-emphasizing the land.</span> That is wrong because the
income
proper imputable to the house, per se, is much less than its rent
equivalent. The house requires constant expenses for upkeep, heating,
maintenance and repairs, cleaning, painting, etc. etc. The house also
depreciates, physically. Those expenses and the depreciation must be
deducted from the rental equivalent to get the net income.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The
land, that is the space and location, does not depreciate physically,
and so requires none of those expenses. Its rental equivalent is its
net current income. Instead, it usually appreciates in value, and that
annual increment is also a current income. So the &#8220;imputed income of
owner-occupied housing&#8221; is mostly attributable to the land - but no one
is saying so.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, it is misleading
by
omitting vast lands beyond the &#8220;house&#8221;
value, narrowly defined. </span>We may presume that &#8220;house&#8221; includes
the land
under it, and a little yard or curtilage, but what about other lands
held for the owners&#8217; personal enjoyment? No agency collects data on
such lands and their values, but common observation tells us they are
vast and valuable, and dominate values in many &#8220;rural&#8221; counties.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c. Use of &#8220;NIPA&#8221; accounts from the U.S. Department of Commerce</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; The
standard source of data on GNP and its components is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">National
Income and Product Account (NIPA)</span>, kept and published regularly
by the
U.S. Department of Commerce. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When
it comes to rent, however, NIPA
depends on the IRS figures, which thus are passed along to all students
of economics as the &#8220;official&#8221; accounting.</span> We have just seen how
far
from reality these data are.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; NIPA
is worse, in a way, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIPA
explicitly excludes &#8220;capital gains&#8221; from National Income.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; NIPA
is better by virtue of its making a gesture at including the imputed
value of owner-occupied housing. Whether they do it right is a question
on my agenda.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> d. Use of Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
estimates</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; Another source of data is the FRB. Unfortunately it is ensnared
in the
same intellectual webs as the other agencies, so its nominal
independence is wasted. <a
 href="../auth/Hudson.html">Michael Hudson</a> has dissected
FRB methods, which resulted in reporting rents of income property far below reality.
The
reductio ad absurdum arrived when its clerks, evidently plodding &#8220;on
automatic,&#8221; duly reported that the rents of all the income property in
the U.S.A. are negative. Someone in authority finally noticed, was
embarrassed, and discontinued the series.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.
Relying on the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; Many
economists treat numbers from the NBER as iconic. The press routinely
cites their datings of U.S. recessions and recoveries as &#8220;official.&#8221; Many
writers cite <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raymond Goldsmith</span>'s
estimates of United States land
values, dating from 1955 and 1962, as &#8220;authoritative,&#8221; because they
carry the NBER imprimatur. Yet they do not bear examination, even for
their times. They were generated as incidents to other work in an
offhand and indefensible way.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; It
is not easy to retrace Goldsmith's steps; one must track interlocking
footnotes from several sources. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">At the end of the trail, however,
he
simply takes residential land value as 15 percent of building value
(which comes to 13 percent of land and building value).</span> The
basis of
this allocation is the share of land in the cost of one to four family
houses insured by the Federal Housing Authority, which was about 20
percent. He does not even explain why he cut this down to 13 percent.
Goldsmith then applies this basis to nonresidential real estate as
well. As for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate held
lands</span>, he enters them at book value -- an
attitude that opened the door to an epidemic of corporate raiding.
Goldsmith also seems to omit vacant lots and unsubdivided land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; These methods are not worthy of the faith with which several economists
cite the results. <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA insured houses
are not typical. They tend to be
new and on cheap land. </span>Those not new are not very old -- in
1967 the
median age of insured existing homes was thirteen years. To apply such
data to a typical American city, most of whose dwelling units in 1965
antedated 1920, was outlandish. It is more outlandish today in 2004.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA
clientele is lower middle class, which means the land share is low,
land being both a consumer luxury and a rich man's hedge, the land
share rising sharply with value.</span> The high land share in Beverly
Hills,
Greenwich, Belvedere, Santa Fe Springs, Palm Beach, Kenilworth, and
other enclaves of wealth is missing from FHA data.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; The FHA is most
active at
the expanding fringe of cities. A basic fact of urban land economics is
that the land share rises toward the center. In Manhattan, for example,
the share of assessed land value has always been higher than in the
other boroughs.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying a land
fraction
derived from
residential data to commerce and industry is not believable. The land
share is highest in retailing, the more so now that retailing entails
vast parking areas.</span> Filling stations and and drive-ins of all
kinds entail vast aprons for small buildings with short lives. Some
retailers store their inventories outdoors: auto dealerships, lumber
yards, junk yards are examples. Many wholesalers and industries do the
same: tank farms, railroad yards, utility easements, industrial
reserves, dumps, drive ins, salt beds, terminals, heaps of coal and
salt and sulfur, and so on and on. In downtown Milwaukee, half the
assessed value is land. In Manhattan, it is instructive to consider the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Empire State Building</span>. If ever
a structure overdeveloped a site, the world's tallest building on a
fringe site should be it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet in two
transactions since 1950 the site was valued at one third the total. One
may infer what this implies of the whole island.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Anyone active in real estate would have caught Goldsmith&#8217;s error. Yet
it passed muster with the NBER, his publisher the Princeton University
Press, and several learned academic reviewers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a measure of
their general incompetence, but of the extent to which academicians
have walled themselves off from anything bearing on the realities of
land values and rents. Goldsmith treated land carelessly, as a trivial
side-issue, and his finding was ignored by everyone except those who
needed to invoke an authority to trivialize land value.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp; Several published case
studies document the higher ratio of land value to building value in non-residential
uses, and central cities. Here I
will merely list them.</small><br>
That is, first the IRS converts rents into
capital gains, and then NIPA banishes capital gains from GNP, National
Income, and National Product. &#8220;Capital gains&#8221; is an artificial term,
that includes all gains realized from the sale of what Congress defines
at any time as &#8220;capital assets.&#8221; &#8220;Capital assets&#8221; include land and
improvements, housing, common stock, growing timber, breeding herds
(including race and show and riding horses), mineral and hydrocarbon
reserves in the ground, and several other favorite holdings of the rich
and well-connected. As we saw in &#8220;b&#8221;, most commercial rents show
up as
capital gains, so that NIPA does not report them at all. Then along
come highly visible economists like Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow,
Theodore Schultz, Edwin Mills, Jan Pen, and others to look up this
datum, and declare that land rents are no more than 5% of national
income, and cannot possibly support modern governments. This is
unfortunate, and quite misleading. </li>

Goldsmith's transfer of the land share in a few new FHA residences to

and destroys any value they might have.</small><br>

<small>&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another Goldsmith error is to
exclude subsoil assets.</span> In cities
overlying oil pools, like Huntington Beach, that would make a big

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
f. Ernest Kurnow&#8217;s work under Lincoln and Moley</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
Ernest Kurnow low-balled land and rent values in a chapter in Joseph
Keiper, Ernest Kurnow, Clifford Clark, and Harvey Segal, 1961, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Theory
and Measurement of Rent</span> (Philadelphia: Chilton Co.). In an
introduction, the authors thank the Lincoln Foundation for financing
their work, but then go on to thank David Lincoln and Raymond Moley
personally for intellectual guidance. Then, extraordinarily, they omit
the standard disclaimer absolving their advisors and taking full
responsibility for the work that bears their names. This is a unique
omission. <span style="font-style: italic;">Res ipsa loquitur</span>:
David Lincoln is speaking. That helps
explain why researchers seeking full estimates of land values seek in
vain at the Lincoln Institute, Lincoln&#8217;s alter ego.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Kurnow's basic source is tax assessments. He accepts their allocation
of value between land and buildings. Errors are possible, but he
dismisses them because "in all likelihood there is a tendency for such
errors to cancel each other." We have seen how wrong and biased that
is. He does not even correct for the assessment bias shown by sales
assessment ratios of Manvel's Census of Governments, nor for the
greater degree of underassessment revealed by mapping of land values.
He does not consider any of the 17 bulleted points shown above.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; Most
modern economists who look into these matters rely upon standard
sources a-f above, mindless, or perhaps even glad, of their downward
biases, and unwilling to research the matter themselves. Young students
are intimidated and awed, or at least impressed and convinced, by the
&#8220;official&#8221;-looking auspices of the standard sources.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;</small>

Pundits since November have noted an apparent anomaly: lower-income
states voted red, and higher-income states voted blue.&nbsp; Within
each state, lower-income counties voted red, and higher-income counties
voted blue.&nbsp; In California, the inland counties went red, while
coastal counties, plump with wealth and income, went blue. Depressed
upstate New York went red, while rich New York City went blue.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
On purely economic grounds, &#8220;it&#8217;s a puzzlement.&#8221; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why do poor people
support the party of big corporations and the rich?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To understand the politics of
New York
City or San Francisco we need to
begin by noting that they have about the highest residential rents and
home prices in the U.S.A., along with the highest tenancy rates. It
takes a high monetary income even to be poor in such places, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unless you
own land</span>.</span> Federal statisticians who publish the Consumer
Price Index
(CPI) delicately refrain from comparing different cities - they just
compare different times, city by city. This helps them finesse tough
questions about rents, and housing prices. Common observation, however,
and various semi-popular publications, fill the gap.&nbsp; The C.O.L.,
especially its rent and home value elements, is a lot higher in the big
glamorous cities, so real incomes there are a lot lower than they look
- unless you own land. ...<br>
<br>
Blue states and blue
counties are generally those where land is out of reach of a high
fraction of the people.</small>&nbsp; <small>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Fred Foldvary: <a

A Plea to Public Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW
LARGE IS THE
GEO-RENT TAX-BASE?</span></small><br>
<small>One of the pitfalls surrounding the idea of tapping geo-rent is
that it
is closely associated with Henry George&#8217;s <span
 style="font-style: italic;">single</span>-tax ideal society. Authors
such as Mankiw (2004, 168) and McConnell and Brue (2005, 300) point out
that geo-rent taxation alone could not cover the current levels of
government spending. But that point works only as a criticism of
eliminating all taxes aside from geo-rent taxation, not as a criticism
of the principle of the idea of tapping geo-rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I have the further impression that many economists think that
geo-rent
is a tiny portion of GDP. That notion seems to lead some economists to
figure that even if geo-rent taxation is efficient, it is empirically
of small import. Dick Netzer (1998, 116) notes that the proposition
that &#8220;the potential revenue from land value taxation&#8221; is insufficient
&#8220;is widely held today.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a chapter entitled &#8220;rent, interest, and profits,&#8221; Salvatore
and
Diulio (1996) have an exercise, &#8220;What are the criticisms of the
single-tax movement?&#8221; One criticism offered is that &#8220;rents in the
United States today amount to just about 1% of GNP, while taxes are 25%
of GNP&#8221; (355).</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the official GDP accounts by the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Bureau
of Economic Analysis</span> in the Department of Commerce, the only
category termed &#8220;rent&#8221; is "rental income of persons," which in 2004 was
put at an annualized estimate of $150 billion, or less than 1.5% of
GDP. This "rental income" is net of expenses such as property taxes and
mortgage interest, but the bulk of such expenses are also returns on
real estate which are being paid to lenders and the government!

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  How much revenue?</p>
  <p>Total land values or land rents are not reported in national statistics.
    The U.S. national income accounts have a number only for the &#8220;rental income
      of persons,&#8221; which excludes rent obtained by corporations and the rental
      value of government land. This &#8220;rental income&#8221; is after all
      expenses, including property taxes, and so includes only a tiny fraction
      of the geo-rent.40</p>
  <p>The national rent in the United Kingdom has been estimated at 22 percent of
      national income, which exceeds the amount raised in that country by the income
      tax.41 Steven Cord42 estimated the annual economic rent of land in the U.S.
      in 1986 at $680 billion, 20 percent of national income, while Mike Miles (1990)
      arrived at a similar figure using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.43
      The totals include government lands but do not include the increase in geo-rent
      that would occur with the elimination of market-hampering taxes.</p>
  <p>  Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation would provide
        about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local government revenue,
        which would be more than adequate for government spending if it did not include
        transfer payments. The taxable value of the land in the economy would increase
        over time for two reasons.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, a shift from taxing production to taxing land values would eliminate
              the lost output due to taxes &#8212; about $1 trillion per year.44
              One-fifth of that would be rent, thus increasing rent by $300 billion.</li>
    <li> Secondly, the economy would grow faster, which also would increase rent
              over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Tideman et al. (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain (measured in
      real dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land as could be financed
      by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion or 14% of NDP in
      2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even if only a fraction
      of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes we know today to a geo-rent
      tax, the efficiency gains could be substantial. Some critics simply do not
      believe these results, without bothering to read them. I have not seen a rebuttal
      of Tideman&#8217;s calculation. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Second Set of Books</p>
  <p>Mental models begin with assumptions. Most economists today assume there
    are only two kinds of property, private (that is, corporate or individual)
    and state. There are no shared assets, no inter- or intragenerational obligations,
    and no nonhumans other than those we eat.</p>
  <p>Yet as we&#8217;ve seen, many things are missing here. The most obvious
    omission is the great economy of nature within which the human enterprise
    operates. We&#8217;re borrowing prodigiously from that economy, but not recording
    the loans. Equally absent are future generations, from whom we&#8217;re borrowing
    just as wantonly and surreptitiously. In a proper bookkeeping system, every
    loan shows up on two balance sheets, the borrower&#8217;s and the lender&#8217;s.
    One entity&#8217;s liability is another entity&#8217;s asset. But this isn&#8217;t
    true in contemporary economics. When the human economy grows, assets on corporate
    and individual balance sheets go up, but nowhere is there a debit. In fact,
    there aren&#8217;t any accounts that could be debited. There&#8217;s only
    good growth on one side of the ledger, and on the other, a void in which
    illth and debt accumulate, uncounted and unnoticed.</p>
  <p>In recent years, economists have added a few bits to this stripped-down
    model. For example, they now recognize public goods and ecosystem services
    as contributors of economic value. Public goods are services like national
    defense, education, and flood control, which benefit everyone but can&#8217;t
    easily be sold at a profit. Because markets don&#8217;t adequately supply
    them, governments step in and do so. Economists sometimes debate whether
    the value of these public goods exceeds the &#8220;burden&#8221; they impose
    on taxpayers, but they don&#8217;t see the expenditures as adding value to
    any account, or to any asset owned by anyone.</p>
  <p>Similarly, many economists now recognize ecosystem services as valuable
    inputs to the economy. However, the ecosystems that produce these services
    have no owners or balance sheets. They&#8217;re just there, floating in space,
    with no connection to humans. What I&#8217;m suggesting is that economists
    treat them as if they were common property held in trust. This simple supposition
    would not only put ecosystems on the books, enabling us to track them better;
    it would also pave the way to real-world property rights that actually protect
    those ecosystems. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
