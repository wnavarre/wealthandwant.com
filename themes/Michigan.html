Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>
Another outstanding example of simply following appraisal laws is
Southfield, Michigan. State law required all taxable property to be
appraised at market value. Buildings there in 1960 were assessed at 70
to 80 percent of value and land at five to 10 percent. After Mayor S.
James Clarkson took office on a promise to correct this violation, and
after a fight with the assessor, special interest groups, and the
courts, the city stopped overvaluing new construction and remodels and
began appraising land by its highest and best use. Soon the contrast
with the slums of nearby Detroit were patent. Mayor Clarkson stated
that Detroit taxed land values "next to nil" under Depression era
assumptions. Voters reelected him four times on his promise of fair
assessments. Average homeowners paid 22 percent less in taxes
immediately. Those who held large empty lots in desirable locations saw
huge tax increases but reaped windfall profits from selling or
developing. As Detroiters migrated outward, accurate assessments
enabled Southfield to capture rising land values, bulking up its tax
base by 20 percent a year. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jim Clarkson:<a href="../docs/Clarkson_Adventure.html"> The Great Adventure</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>George's fame led him to be drafted by the United Labor Party to run for
    Mayor of New York in 1886. George lost to Abram Hewitt (and Theodore Roosevelt
    came
    in third). George wrote several books, including Social Problems, Protection
    or Free Trade (which was read in its entirety into the US Congressional Record)
    and others. George's remedy was born out of the classical economists Adam
    Smith and <a href="Mill.html">John Stuart Mill</a>'s beliefs that the unearned increment from the
    rent of
    land belonged to the people. Others who believed the same way were Thomas
    Jefferson, <a href="Locke.html">John Locke</a>, Thomas Paine, <a href="../auth/Twain.html">Mark
    Twain,</a> Abraham Lincoln and <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill </a>(to name a few) and without a doubt Mr. Alan Brett,
  my mentor whose name "Alan" I gave to my fourth son.<br>
  <br>
  My own experience of land ownership came about from a speech I gave before
  the Southfield Economics Club when I was given the name of "Sour
  Grapes". Why the name "Sour Grapes," I asked the name caller. "Simply put, he
  said, "you do not own any land." It was then I knew that to prove speculating
  in land would reward me with unearned wealth, I had to invest in land to prove
  the point.<br>
  <br>
  The first of many speculative ventures, for instance, was when a house came up
  for sale on Southfield Road just North of Ten Mile Road. I convinced my law partners
  to join with me in its purchase. I knew that Southfield Road would be widened
  to four lanes and increase its value. We purchased the property with $3,000 down
  on a land contract for $18,000. Just over six months later we sold it for $32,000.
  All the
  profit was from the increase in the value of the land and was unearned.<br>
  <br>
  It took some courage to practice what I preached, but once after the first
  experiment in this adventure, I was forever hooked and consequently, found
  myself rationalizing
  my action by espousing the merit of land value taxation and thereby justifying
  my investment in land as a means to prove my point. The practical aspect of
  this is easily understood when in the talks that I give, and have given, across
  the
  nation and in Canada, I could more easily ford the question that implied that
  my advocating of land value taxation was but "Sour Grapes" for my failure to
  have benefited from the system.<br>
  <br>
  Not all nations or political subdivisions have failed to "see the cat", but
  many have adopted various forms of Land Value Taxation -- for example, by differential
  rates of taxation by placing a higher percentage on the land than on the improvements.
  The State of Alaska, for example, has secured the value of its oil royalties
  for their
  citizens by what is called the Alaskan Permanent fund.<br>
  <br>
  Governor Jay Hammond introduced a proposed Constitutional Amendment to create
  the Permanent Fund in 1976, and it was approved by the people that fall. From
  then on, 25% of all mineral lease rentals, royalties, royal sales proceeds, federal
  mineral revenue sharing payments, and bonuses received by the state were placed
  into the Permanent fund. Every man, woman and child in Alaska with a qualfying
  12-month residency is entitled to a portion of each year's earnings. In 1998
  each resident received $1,769.84, and for 1999 it was $1,963.86. Just think,
  a family of four would receive $7,855.44.<br>
  <br>
  This could be done in every state in America. Land values belong to the people.
  Let us give it to them! It is up to you to advocate the change or become a Land
  Lord. ... <a href="../docs/Clarkson_Adventure.html">read the whole article</a></p>

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_WHWASRSIPT.html"><small>What
happens when a state radically
slashes its property tax?</small> </a></small> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Michiganders are saying they must wait and
    see, but there is no need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience.
    To read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened since
    California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have been to
    cut public services, raise other taxes, and lose credit rating.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>The private sector is doing badly, too.</b> Raising income taxes,
  business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an economy; they are
  all a drag on work and enterprise.<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  <small><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about it,
  the expectable result of what the voters did.</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
      from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and pay
      taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small></li>
  <li><small>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in favor of the
      rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The predictable result is to inhibit economic
    activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of Prop. 13
  as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the social compact." <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  <small><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in L.A., 1945-50. </b>These
  were small, creative, flexible, and too varied to classify. No Linnaeus could
  sort them in conventional categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here
  and started producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
  and others never seen before.<strong>&nbsp; ...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why is that not happening today, 1995?</b> An
    invisible, pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible
    to hold land at negligible tax cost. In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every year,
    building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. Today that same
    tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of Thumb</b> (see below
    under B,1), it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1% applied to 1/8 of the true
    value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landowners are only taxed now if they
      use their land to hire people and produce something useful. Then they meet
      the drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated
      by the fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
      most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us segue
      from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a third-world
      economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little relief in sight.
      ... </b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing growth up
    to 1978, and the resilience to shrug off the loss of war industries after
    1945 and still grow "explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we
    have a string of reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis,
    plus various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
    an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13. <b>Michigan,
    be warned of our lot, and learn about taxes from us: "This Could Happen to
    You." </b></small><small><small><a
