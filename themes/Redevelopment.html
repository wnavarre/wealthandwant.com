for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>As with negative
externalities, the fact that labor and capital are not
perfectly mobile means that not all of the effects of activities with
positive externalities are reflected in land values.&nbsp; And to the
extent that labor and capital are affected, negative effects are likely
to be more prominent than positive effects.&nbsp; Consider
structures.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">If an existing
structure is efficient for the current
pattern of surrounding land uses, and if new use of surrounding land
raises the value of the land under the structure, then the structure
can be expected to thereby become suboptimal.&nbsp; The pre-existing
structure is generally not as intensive a use of land as would have
been chosen with knowledge of the new activity.&nbsp; Therefore the
economic life of the pre-existing structure (the time until it is
efficient to demolish it) is shortened by the new activity that
increases land value.&nbsp; Even though rent per square foot of built
space rises, the rise is not enough to offset the increase in land
value, which presumes the newly efficient size for a structure, thereby
reducing the amount of the current return that is attributable to the
existing structure and pushing the structure toward obsolescence.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>A similar phenomenon occurs with respect to the personal value
that
people attach to locations, what might be called &#8216;location-specific
human capital&#8217;.&nbsp; If all persons had equal demands for all
locations, there would be no location-specific human capital.&nbsp; But
incomes, tastes and personal histories differ, leading to differing
personal values for locations.&nbsp; Famil&shy;iarity with a location
tends to lead people to attach a special value to it, a value that
tends to be lost if the characteristics of the location change.&nbsp;
Thus a change in land use that raises surrounding land values will
generally reduce the location-specific human capital of the residents
of that area.&nbsp; One example of this phenomenon occurs when a
neighborhood is &#8216;gentrified&#8217;, and the prior residents of modest means
can no longer afford to live there and must seek other housing options
that are less attractive to them than the opportunities they
lost.&nbsp; This represents a reduction in their location-specific
human capital. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The efficiency that is entailed
in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>8. A self-assessed tax on
permanent improvements to land, at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1%
per year). With a self-assessed tax, each possessor of land names a
price at which he would be willing to part with the land he possesses
(and any immovable improvements). He pays a tax proportional to the
value he names, and anyone who wishes to may take over possession at
that price. The value of such a tax is that it makes it much easier to
assemble land for redevelopment, and to identify appropriate
compensation when land is taken for public purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">Land Taxation and Efficient
    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To see how land speculation can lead to a waste of resources, it is useful
    to develop a somewhat formal model of land management and land speculation.
    Abstract from the continuous divisibility of land and suppose that land comes
    in "sites." At each moment in time, each
  site is in one of three states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Suitable for agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>2. Suitable for housing.</p>
      <p>3. Suitable for commercial activity.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>While each site can be used for any activity, the net return will be greatest
    if it is used for the activity for which it is suited, provided that it remains
    in that activity long enough to fully amortize the associated capital that
    is state-specific, durable and immobile. What could keep a site from remaining
    in an activity long enough to amortize the associated capital is that from
    time to time a site makes a transition from state 1 to state 2 or from state
    2 to state 3. These transitions are imperfectly predictable. When a transition
    from state 2 to state 3 occurs unexpectedly, the course of action that maximizes
    the net return to the site may entail scrapping prematurely the residential
    structure built there and building a commercial structure. In such an instance,
    one may be able to look backward and say that it would have been better not
    to have built the residential structure at all, but rather to have left the
    site in agricultural use until the transition to state 3 occurred. However,
    such reckoning can affect investment decisions only to the extent that transitions
    can be foreseen.... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>  Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
    Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<font size="3"><small><br>
... by
taxing land, society impels owners who had been speculatively
withholding or underutilizing theirs to develop or offer their parcels
for development. Hence the newly-available land comes from recycled
sites, not from open space.</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep and

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conversely, new buildings help

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a city untaxes buildings its
land prices, the new tax base,
are pushed up. Competition for sites raises the tax base -- not
buildings, now, but land prices derived from ground rents. Using the
higher base the city can improve public services, if needed, but
without taxing any building, without scaring away any generators of
fiscal surpluses. In this scenario, buildings raise the tax base
indirectly, by raising the value of land around them. So do
productive people, when their wages are not taxed away. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices are raised just by the

itself; it only comes when incidental to releasing land for new

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>Pinchot
on "Development"</b></small></small></small>
</small><br>
<small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;"><small>"The first
principle of conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes for all the exhaustible natural resources,
... (water power and water transportation are his examples). ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small></div>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the
second place conservation stands for the prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all
the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Second, using good central
land saves all the costs of settling
on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of
conservation our times have forgot. </span>You cannot beat development
by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,
timely renewal of older cities, inner suburbs, and neighborhoods.</span>...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html">    <span

been milked dry. Their depreciation allowances are reinvested on new
frontiers; people and vitality move with the capital. It is an
important half-truth, but a half-truth is also half wrong. The basic
original site stays put; land cannot move. Public and private social
capital cannot move, either. </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>We cannot
afford throwaway cities in a
finite world. New natural
sites are not common. There is only one Hudson Valley with only one
mouth, and here New York City has stood for 350 years. We cannot
abandon the Bronx and duplicate its environment somewhere; we cannot
rebuild the natural setting, and the sunk social capital is too
costly. Relocating to suburbs involves commuting cost in terms of
money and congestion. And then, when we tire of the new suburbs,
where will we go next?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, blighted areas have
high potential market values.
Picture a topographic map of a city where the contour lines represent
points not of equal elevation, but of equal market value per square
foot. The peaks, the Everests and McKinleys, are in the city retail
centers, where just one square foot rises to $2,000 (about $90
million per acre). Land just a few miles away from dizzying altitudes
can hardly be worthless. Harlem is near Park Avenue; Watts is near
Beverly Hills; South State Street is very near the Sears Tower.
Newark is 15 minutes by train from Manhattan. Newark office rents are
$25/sf per year. That is less, of course, than in Manhattan, but in
Riverside, California, we are throwing up offices to get rent of
$12/sf per year, while Newark stagnates.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital earning $25 is obviously
more productive than that
yielding $12. I do not mean capital in the floor atop a high-rise,
which likely costs $25/sf (in annualized terms) to build and operate;
but capital in lower floors, which costs less to build but rents for
as much, yielding a surplus. To get more such capital and the
corresponding surplus, renew more land in high potential areas, like
Newark. Not to renew is to waste potential surpluses. Each year's
loss is gone forever; services of land perish with time. Urban
revival works best when healthy pieces remain on which to anchor
development. In the worst scenario no such place remains, but even
Camden has Campbell Soup; Newark has a great airport, a new Hartz
Mountain Industrial Park, and the Pru. Life is persistent and
resilient; seedlings that sprout seek only sunshine, water, and
cultivation. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
counterpart of sharing rent
through taxation is to untax
things, like buildings, that involve human endeavor.</span> This
doubles the
incentive effect. If land tax is the stick, untaxing buildings is the
corresponding carrot, and George's program makes both larger. Every
lot with an old "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Defender</span>"
building has a potential replacement, the
"<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Challenger</span>."
Taxing buildings rigs the fight against the Challenger.
Say the lot-cum-Defender is worth $100K, and the Challenger would
cost $500K to build. Challenger cash flow must exceed Defender cash
flow by enough to pay $500K, plus added taxes based on it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax, by contrast, is
impartial between Defender and
Challenger; the market decides. In 1965, after a detailed Milwaukee
study, I found that switching to the George program would allow 30%
of the city to be renewed immediately, simply by untaxing Challengers
vis-a-vis Defenders. (Sadly, Mayor Maier went the other way, so
Milwaukee lost 20% of its people and much of its wealth.)&nbsp; <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Annual revaluation of land for
tax purposes might seem to impose
extra uncertainty on landowners, in comparison to the lot of lessees
on fixed terms. However it is only the amount of the tax that is
uncertain; the principle of it is known and certain. Furthermore the
principle is such that the tax only rises when exogenous forces raise
the earning potential of land; thus the added tax is neither
arbitrary nor grievous to bear. When exogenous forces lower earnings,
they also lower the tax burden, so that the fisc shares the risk with
landowners.</small> </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Annual revaluation occasionally
will penalize a landowner when the
best use of land changes in the midlife of a durable building.
Anticipating that hazard, landowners in some times and places will
avoid long commitments. This is not such a bad effect, however. Life
is uncertain; economic tides are uncertain; optimal land use calls
for frequent adjustments to new forces and data. Therefore the most
fixed, durable improvement should rarely be encouraged. It is too
ponderous and inflexible, too likely to be a monument or white
elephant that will obsolesce before it pays off. Some examples are
the C&amp;O Canal, the Great Wall of China, the Edsel plant, the
Maginot Line, and a dozen buildings we could all pick out in our own
cities. In my own neighborhood, near a growing shopping center, over
half the parcels have been cleared and rebuilt in the last fifteen
years, even without any tax stimulus. In dynamic times and places it
is good for builders to anticipate fairly early demolition and
renewal, and plan accordingly.... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The question I am assigned is
whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span><b> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revitalization</span>,
and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The property tax,
rather than "shoot anything that
moves," is a charge on inactivity.</span></b> It taxes both lands and
buildings on their market value, regardless of how they are used.
"Hold on," you might say, "how about the very activity of
constructing those buildings?" Yes, touch&eacute;, the property tax
does shoot at that, and shoot hard. However, that is why we are here
today, to consider modifying the tax to exempt buildings. The
proposal is to make it a tax mainly, or even purely, on "land ex
buildings," a tax on inactivity, a tax just for sitting on a piece
carved from the world's fixed, limited land supply.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> The taxable capacity of land
is camouflaged in our times
by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a consistent modern
tendency to underassess it, relative to
buildings.</span> There are several studies in point. The most general
one
is the quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It
actually understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of
land most underassessed, that is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">raw acreage in and near
cities.</span></b></small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
... </span><br>
<br>
<small><b>I have here data (Gaffney, 1970, submitted herewith) I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%. &nbsp;</b></small>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling
a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When
the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Check the Empire State
Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location?
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Besides that, exempting
buildings from the property tax will
raise the value of the land that goes with them. When you exempt
buildings and uptax land, you are still taxing the same parcel of
real estate, you are just taxing it in a different way. What you
don't get from the building you can now get from the land, whose
taxable capacity is enhanced by your exempting the building, and all
potential future buildings, on the parcel. The process of arbitrage,
the higgling of the land market, should make the land value rise by
about the amount of the discounted present value of the building
taxes abated.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;How much is that? Take a
property tax rate at 2% of the
market value of a new building. Over fifty years, tax payments add up
to 100% of the original value. That's a lot. To be sure, we must
correct for the "time value of money," and discount those future
payments to the present. We must adjust for the anticipated drop in
the building assessment after 20 years or so. Doing so brings that
100% down to about 30%, more or less, depending on your discount
rate.<b> Thus, the impact of a 2% property tax on a new structure is
about the same as a 30% building permit fee levied once, at the time
of building.</b> Ouch! Remove that tax threat and buyers will be
willing, if they must, to bid that much more for the land underneath.
If they must? They must: competition and arbitrage see to that. Land
is fixed, but Capital flows like liquid or gas. It abhors a vacuum,
and rushes into new chances. To seize this one, the investors must
bid for land in the subject jurisdiction. <b>Collectively they bid
land up, fortifying your land tax base.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Please understand, the
proposed tax change will not
produce an untempered rise of land prices. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxing land at a higher
rate balances and offsets the effect of exempting buildings. It tends
to lower land prices,</span> just as untaxing buildings tends to raise
them.
On balance, however, the positive effects on land prices will
outweigh the negative ones, because of the constructive incentive
effects of changing the tax base to land. Read on.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"What, then, will have
changed?", you might be asking. It's
a fair question. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's changed is
that your property tax is no
longer biased against renewal, against replacement of old by new</span>.
Neither is it biased against full development of the economic
capacity of each site. All the ground rents that are now aborted by
deferral of renewal, and by underdevelopment, will be generated by
new, full development. Land prices, your new tax base, will be pushed
up just by the expectation of new buildings' being tax free. The mere
expectation will immediately boost the value of land, your new city
tax base, even before the new buildings go up.&nbsp;</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Corporate" is not
coterminous with "industrial," anyway.
Many corporations are in retailing. They own chain stores, malls,
gasoline stations, auto dealerships, major real estate
"developments," drive-ins, office space, department stores, banks,
"power centers," etc. As to these, shifting to the land basis will
shift more of the tax burden to them, because retailing has a higher
land fraction than any other major land use (except vacant, golf
courses, cemeteries, parking lots, etc.). <b>That is because location
is more critical to retailers than other businesses. You can tell
this by their high rate of tear-downs and remodeling.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Among its other effects,
site-value taxation will induce
some land to shift from retail to industrial use.</b> Recall that
exempting the building, or prospective building, lets buyers bid more
for land. The higher the building fraction, the stronger is that
force. Thus the present system, which is biased against buildings
generally, is biased against industrial compared with retail uses.
Removing that bias will help industry outbid retail for land -- not
all land, of course, but land on the tipping point between the uses.
Most towns today seem oversupplied with retailers, compared with
their shortage of basic industries. Shifting to the site-value basis
of property taxation helps redress that balance.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.&nbsp; </b>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

Wyn Achenbaum: <a
 href="../docs/Achenbaum_EmDo.html">Eminent
Domain and Government Giveaways<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me that there are
better ways than eminent domain to
provide the incentives that will lead the private sector to develop
choice land. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<small><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Achenbaum_Eminent_Domain.html"></a></small><br>
<small>While at one time this area might have been an appropriate place
for a
neighborhood of single family homes, it appeared to me that that time
had passed a decade or so ago. It seemed to me that the path of
progress would -- if the incentives were logical and the market
responsive to signals -- have caused the private sector to have
redeveloped that site. Such re-development might have been painful to
the residents of the neighborhood, but would have put now-choice land
to a higher and better use than single-family homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But our system wasn't designed to send signals all that well --
Connecticut law required properties to be reassessed once every decade
(and I've heard that once in early '70s and once in the late 80's was
construed to satisfy that requirement).</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small>But if the properties had been reassessed on a regular basis,
with
market-based values assigned first to the land and the residual being
assigned to the existing buildings, the homeowners themselves would
have been in a position to make their own rational decisions on whether
it was worth it to them to continue to occupy extremely valuable land
(and pay the taxes on it), or more to their advantage to accept an
offer from someone who was prepared to put it to a higher and better
use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<br>
<small>Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or
something else
that was a highly appropriate use for its site -- and typical of the
neighborhood -- 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial
buildings. The home or diner is something everyone else has to walk
around, drive around. If that site were well developed, it could
prevent the premature development of far less desirable sites on the
fringe of town -- an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
acres on the fringe.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small>But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed,
land
first and buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which
tell us when it might be time to move on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the absence of such a system of regular revaluations and a
property
tax which is concentrated on land values rather than equally on land
and buildings, New London turned to eminent domain. But eminent domain
is not the problem here. Lack of appropriate signals is the problem. </small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<br>
<small>Our land, particularly the best-located land, is a common asset
on
which we are all dependent. Allowing individuals or corporations to
occupy it without compensating the rest of us for its value is the
underlying problem, and solving that problem through good assessment
and rational (that is, land value) taxes is the way to solve it. When
we do that, a lot of problems will begin to fall away.&nbsp; <a
