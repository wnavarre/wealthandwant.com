Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A strong, absolute ruler might
hope by such regulations to
alleviate the conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our
times is toward democracy, and democratic States are necessarily weaker
in paternalism, while, <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the
industrial slavery growing out of private
ownership of land that prevails in Christendom today, it is not the
master who forces the slave to labor, but the slave who urges the
master to let him labor.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, the greatest difficulty in
enforcing such regulations
comes from those whom they are intended to benefit. It is not, far
instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce restrictions on
child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, Prompted by poverty,
misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters and teach
the children to misrepresent.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... WHAT I ask you here tonight is as
    far as you can to join in this general movement and push on the cause. It
    is not a local matter, it is a worldwide matter. It is not a matter than
    interests merely the people of Ireland, the people of England and Scotland
    or of any other country in particular, but it is a matter that interests
    the whole world. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we are battling for
    is the freedom of mankind; what we are struggling for is for the abolition
    of that industrial slavery which as mud enslaves men as did chattel slavery. </span>It
    will not take the sword to win it. There is a power far stronger than the
    sword and that is the power of public opinion. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When the masses of men know what hurts them
    and how it can be cured when they know what to demand, and to make their
    demand heard and felt, they will have it and no power on earth can prevent
    them What enslaves men everywhere is ignorance and prejudice.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>If we were to go to that island that we imagined, and if you were fools
  enough to admit that the land belonged to me, I would be your master, and you
  would be my slaves just as thoroughly, just as completely, as if I owned your
  bodies, for all I would have to do to send you out of existence would be to
  say to you "get off my property." That is the cause of the industrial slavery
  that exists all over the world, that is the cause of the low wages, that is
  the cause of the unemployed labor. <a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not
      Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are selling land now in large
quantities to certain English lords, who are coming over here and
buying greater estates than the greatest in Great Britain or Ireland.
We are selling them land; they are buying land. Did it ever occur to
you that they do not want that land? They have no use whatever for
American land; they do not propose to come over here and live on it.
They cannot carry it over there to where they do live.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
you make upon it." What we are selling those foreign lords is not
really land; we are selling them the labor of American citizens; we are
selling them the privilege of taking, without any return for it, the
proceeds of the toil of our children.</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
carriages, houses or much more food and wine. He has gained the power
of taking for his own a great number of these products of human labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. When a man who does no work can
get them, necessarily the people who do work to produce them must have
less of the products of human labor than they ought to have. ...&nbsp;<a

<p><a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George, a themed collection of
    excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each
      member is capable of an independent life. He can build his own habitation,
      hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own clothing, manufacture
      his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments. He has all the knowledge
      of nature possessed by his tribe &#8212; knows what vegetable productions
      are fit for food, and where they maybe found; knows the habits and resorts
      of beasts, birds, fishes and insects; can pilot himself by the sun or the
      stars, by the turning of blossoms or the mosses on the trees; is, in short,
      capable of supplying all his wants. He may be cut off from his fellows
      and still live; and thus possesses an independent power which makes him
      a free contracting party in his relations to the community of which he
      is a member.</p>
    <p>Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized
      society, whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but
      the infinitesimal part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of things
      that constitute the wealth of society and go to supply even the most primitive
      wants; who not only cannot make even the tools required for his work, but
      often works with tools that he does not own, and can never hope to own.
      Compelled to even closer and more continuous labor than the savage, and
      gaining by it no more than the savage gets &#8212; the mere necessaries
      of life &#8212; he loses the independence of the savage. He is not only
      unable to apply his own powers to the direct satisfaction of his own wants,
      but, without the concurrence of many others, he is unable to apply them
      indirectly to the satisfaction of his wants. He is a mere link in an enormous
      chain of producers and consumers, helpless to separate himself, and helpless
      to move, except as they move. The worse his position in society, the more
      dependent is he on society; the more utterly unable does he become to do
      anything for himself. The very power of exerting his labor for the satisfaction
      of his wants passes from his own control, and may be taken away or restored
      by the actions of others, or by general causes over which he has no more
      influence than he has over the motions of the solar system. The primeval
      curse comes to be looked upon as a boon, and men think, and talk, and clamor,
      and legislate as though monotonous manual labor in itself were a good and
      not an evil, an end and not a means. Under such circumstances, the man
      loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the godlike power of modifying
      and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave, a machine, a commodity &#8212; a
      thing, in some respects, lower than the animal.</p>
    <p>I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas
      of the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or
      Cooper. I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low
      and narrow range. I believe that civilization is not only the natural destiny
      of man, but the enfranchisement, elevation, and refinement of all his powers,
      and think that it is only in such moods as may lead him to envy the cud-chewing
      cattle, that a man who is free to the advantages of civilization could
      look with regret upon the savage state. But, nevertheless, I think no one
      who will open his eyes to the facts, can resist the conclusion that there
      are in the heart of our civilization large classes with whom the veriest
      savage could not afford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if,
      standing on the threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering
      life as a Terra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in
      the Arctic Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized
      country as Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in
      selecting the lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of
      wealth are condemned to want, suffer all the privations of the savage,
      without his sense of personal freedom; they are condemned to more than
      his narrowness and littleness, without opportunity for the growth of his
      rude virtues; if their horizon is wider, it is but to reveal blessings
      that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book V,
      Chapter 2: The Problem Solved: The Persistence of Poverty Amid Advancing
