  <p>Do we all have equal access to the raw materials, or do some of us own them
      and have the right to sell them to others? By what right do we give some
    the privilege of pocketing the economic value of the raw materials? </p>
  <p>A more just society would not allow that economic value to sit in private
    or corporate pockets, but would collect it in the form of a tax on land value.
    To do so would place us all on equal footing, and not allow some to grow
    wealthy while others toil and pay them for access to materials.</p>
  <p>It's too late to change now, you say? We've been doing it this way for 225
    years, you say? We ended chattel slavery, despite it causing some discomfort
    to slaveholders, because we came to understand that it was just plain wrong,
    even if some of us regarded it as an economic necessity. Are you ready to
    take on the remaining vestige, which cuts across our entire society, as a
    wedge, forcing a few up and most of us down?</p>

</span>Henry George: <a href="../../../wealthandwant/HG/George_TKC.html">Thy
Kingdom Come</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>.. There was a little dialogue published
    in the United States, in the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen
    it. It is between a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy
    looks at the men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why
    they are making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
    then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make any
    bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make bricks.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how the man
    who owns the brickyard gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he
    made it. &#8220;No, he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God
    made it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
    his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but that
    anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with God&#8217;s law.
    The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and had been to church, goes
    off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so loved the world that He gave His
    only begotten Son to die for all men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner
    of this brickyard that He gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But I do
    not refer to it lightly. I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects.
    Yet it is well sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity teaches us;
    think of the life and death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings,
    that we are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
    of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this denial
    of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children of God, which
    so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold; nay, which they blasphemously
    assert is the design and the intent of the Creator Himself. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"
