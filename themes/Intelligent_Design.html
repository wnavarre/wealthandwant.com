<blockquote>
  <p>Georgists see a different aspect of intelligent design from the common usage
      of the phrase. Read on! Henry George expresses it eloquently in his open
    letter to Pope Leo XIII, written 12 years after the publication of <a href="../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress
    and
    Poverty</em></a>, in response to the encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em>. George
    clarifies his vision of the beauties of God's design for all his children,
    not just
    a few! And that doesn't sound so different from the Declaration of Independence's
    assertion  that it is self-evident that all people are created equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p><strong><em>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</em></strong></p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p><strong>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
      civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become
      more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</strong></p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
        of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
        it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
        sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
        and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right
    to do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
        thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the
    fairest division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
        of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; </p>
      </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>the
          octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; </li>
  <li>the monstrous
            customs duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian
    states; </li>
  <li>the taxes
              on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of
    houses, on the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms.    
    <p>Can
              these
                be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the
      means they need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in
    any plan we can
                deem a right one?</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<blockquote>
        <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
          the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
          scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
          price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
          they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
          thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
        others.</p>
        <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
        <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
          are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
          that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
          the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
          effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
          buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
          gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
          of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
          sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
          it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
          of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
          instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
        of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
        <p><strong>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything
            more clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry
            is not the way God
        intended public revenues to be raised?</strong></p>
        <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
          a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
          the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
          of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
          in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
          of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
          reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
          always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
          user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
          pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
          the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
          or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
        to be a user.</p>
        <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
          of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
          what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
          to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
        community as a whole.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
              are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
              what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
              from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
              for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
              be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
              in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
              will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
              as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
              determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
              the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
              increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
              cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
              or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
              in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
              recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
              cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
          Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
                by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
                and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
                can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
            2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
            particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
            by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
            for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
            3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
            in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
            social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
            withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
              be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
              the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
              land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
              because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
              economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
              were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
              since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
              of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
              receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
              demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
              to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
              were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
              for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
          merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
          of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
          to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
          impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
          it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
          by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
          artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
          that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
          most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
          enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
          temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
        innocent.</p>
        <p>But, further: <strong>That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
          needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
          of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
        nourishment of the babe.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition
            ere the need for the state arises there are no land values. The products
            of labor have value,
          but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land
            itself. But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration
            of industry
          necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues,
            value begins to attach to land. As population still increases and
            industry grows
          more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the
            same time and from the same causes land values increase. <em>The connection
            is invariable. </em></strong>The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
          since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
          steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
          centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
          Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
          of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
          due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
          cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
          streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
          health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
          of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
          the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
          improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
          law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
          anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
        values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
        <p><strong>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
          and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
          If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
          with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
          the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
          us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
        that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</strong></p>
        <p>Consider: <em>Here is a natural law by which as society advances the
            one thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by
            virtue of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts,
            all general improvements
          of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and
            the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses
            of society.</em>          Now,
          since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
          is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society,
          is it not clear that the law by which land values increase with social
          advance
          while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with
          the advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to
          each member
          of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him
          from his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization
          lessen
          relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist
          between the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate?
          Does it not show
          the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
          should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and
          greater equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent,
          are making it,
        an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
        <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended
            for social needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous
            God in the sense that nothing but injury and disaster can attend
            the effort of men to do things other than in the way he has intended;
            in the sense that where the blessings he proffers to men are refused
            or misused they turn to evils that scourge us. And just as for the
            mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast with the birth
            of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society to refuse
            to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
        social disease.</p>
        <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that
            attach to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of
            public revenues by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution
            and corrupt society. It is to leave some to take what justly belongs
            to all; it is to forego the only means by which it is possible in
            an advanced civilization to combine the security of possession that
            is necessary to improvement with the equality of natural opportunity
            that is the most important of all natural rights. It is thus at the
            basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality between man
            and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
            for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for
            the gifts of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery
            that the masses of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities
            to a new robbery. For the value that with the increase of population
            and social advance attaches to land being suffered to go to individuals
            who have secured ownership of the land, it prompts to a forestalling
            of and speculation in land wherever there is any prospect of advancing
            population or of coming improvement, thus producing an artificial
            scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor, and a strangulation
            of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial
            depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It is
            this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
            only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
            advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker,
            but to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is
            this that in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large
            population whose lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than
            those of the veriest savages. It is this that leads so many men to
            think that God is a bungler and is constantly bringing more people
            into his world than he has made provision for; or that there is no
            God, and that belief in him is a superstition which the facts of
            life and the advance of science are dispelling.</p>
        <p>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid
              wealth, the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize
              our civilization of today, are the natural, the inevitable results
              of our rejection of God&#8217;s beneficence, of our ignoring of
              his intent. Were we on the other hand to follow his clear, simple
              rule
              of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual all that individual
              labor produces, and taking for the community the value that attaches
              to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could
              evil modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all
              men would
              be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty
              of their Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert their
              labor and to enjoy its fruits. And then, without drastic or restrictive
              measures the forestalling of land would cease. For then the possession
              of land would mean only security for the permanence of its use,
              and there would be no object for any one to get land or to keep
              land
              except for use; nor would his possession of better land than others
              had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation on
              them, since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the
              state for the benefit of all.</p>
        <p>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, who sees all
            this as clearly as we do, in pointing out to the clergy and laity
            of his diocese* the design of Divine Providence that the rent of
            land should be taken for the community, says:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on
                    the strength of authority as well as of reason, that the people
                    are and always must be the real owners of the land of their country.
                    This great social fact appears to me to be of incalculable importance,
                    and it is fortunate, indeed, that on the strictest principles
                    of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty
                    or doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in
                    the clearness with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence
                    of the designs of Providence in the admirable provision he has
                    made for the wants and the necessities of that state of social
                    existence of which he is author, and in which the very instincts
                    of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public property,
                    a great national fund, has been placed under the dominion and
                    at the disposal of the nation to supply itself abundantly with
                    resources necessary to liquidate the expenses of its government,
                    the administration of its laws and the education of its youth,
                    and to enable it to provide for the suitable sustentation and
                    support of its criminal and pauper population. One of the most
                    interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value
                    is never stationary; it is constantly progressive and increasing
                    in a direct ratio to the growth of the population, and the very
                    causes thatincrease and multiply the demands made on it increase
                    proportionately its ability to meet them.<br>

        <p><strong>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty
                in the clearness with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence
                are revealed in this great social fact, the provision made for
                the common needs of society in what economists call <em>the law
                of rent</em>. Of all the evidence that natural religion gives,
                it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a beneficent
                God, and most conclusively silences the doubts that in our days
                lead so many to materialism.</strong></p>
        <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social
            needs of civilization we see that God has intended civilization;
            that all our discoveries and inventions do not and cannot outrun
            his forethought, and that steam, electricity and labor-saving appliances
            only make the great moral laws clearer and more important. In the
            growth of this great fund, increasing with social advance &#8212; a
            fund that accrues from the growth of the community and belongs therefore
            to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is no need for
            the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that promote
            inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
            fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in
            the highest civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s
            bounty, the abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would
            provide amply for every legitimate need of the state. We see that
            God in his dealings with men has not been a bungler or a niggard;
            that he has not brought too many men into the world; that he has
            not neglected abundantly to supply them; that he has not intended
            that bitter competition of the masses for a mere animal existence
            and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize our civilization;
            but that these evils which lead so many to say there is no God, or
            yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
            are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice,
            the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection,
            but indeed the law of social life. We see that if we were only to
            observe it there would be work for all, leisure for all, abundance
            for all; and that civilization would tend to give to the poorest
            not only necessities, but all comforts and reasonable luxuries as
            well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer when he told men
            that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right-doing they
            might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
            field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
            economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth.

        <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive
          term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property, of which
          in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
          if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading
          it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
          property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
          property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge
          for private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order
        of presentation. You urge:</p>
        <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
          (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
          2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
          reason. (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
          3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
          (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
          4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
          (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
          5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
          of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it
          is sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
          6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
          property in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs
          14-17.) ...<br>
          7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
          wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
          51.) ...<br>
          8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
          not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to
          take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
          to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
        <p>          <strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
          reason.</strong> (6-7.)</p>
        <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason
          and forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the
          earth, but also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he
          may make provision for the future.</p>
        <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing
          attribute of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows,
          as the Scriptures declare, that he is created in the likeness of God.
          And this gift of reason does, as your Holiness points out, involve
          the need and right of private property in whatever is produced by the
          exertion of reason and its attendant forethought, as well as in what
          is produced by physical labor. In truth, these elements of man&#8217;s
          production are inseparable, and labor involves the use of reason. It
          is by his reason that man differs from the animals in being a producer,
          and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical powers are slight,
          forming as it were but the connection by which the mind takes hold
          of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and forces
          of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
          in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
        <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach
          to things provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot
          attach to things provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
        <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert
          as the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought
          to provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right
          of property in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless
          desert those who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might
          ask water from the provident in charity, could not demand it in right.
          For while water itself is of the providence of God, the presence of
          this water in such vessels, at such place, results from the providence
          of the men who carried it. Thus they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
        <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
          the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink
          of the water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give
          any right?</p>
        <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it
          is needed, but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to
          defend in defending the private ownership of land!</p>
        <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those
          who say that if private property in land be not just, then private
          property in the products of labor is not just, as the material of these
          products is taken from land. It will be seen on consideration that
          all of man&#8217;s production is analogous to such transportation of
          water as we have supposed. In growing grain, or smelting metals, or
          building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing any of the things that
          constitute producing, all that man does is to change in place or form
          preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer, not a creator;
          God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s production
          consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of private
          ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
          of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production
          is embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the
          common gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir
          and brought into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of
          the individual who by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
        <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary
          possession. For though man may take material from the storehouse of
          nature and change it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from
          the moment he takes it, it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood
          decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates and is displaced, while of
          more perishable products, some will last for only a few months, others
          for only a few days, and some disappear immediately on use. Though,
          so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever persists;
          though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that floats
          in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
          ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining
          constantly passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what
          natural material is embodied in the products of man never constitutes
          more than temporary possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir
          provided for all. As taking water from one place and carrying it to
          another place by no means lessens the store of water, since whether
          it is drunk or spilled or left to evaporate, it must return again to
          the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is it with all things on which man
          in production can lay the impress of his labor.</p>
        <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right
          to have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish
          in the using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you
          are right in so far as you may include such things as buildings, which
          with repair will last for generations, with such things as food or
          fire-wood, which are destroyed in the use. But when you infer that
          man can have private ownership in those permanent things of nature
          that are the reservoirs from which all must draw, you are clearly wrong.
          Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits of the earth produced
          by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of that labor, and
          pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were taken,
          and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
          he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which
          must constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men
          can produce, but even their very bodies.</p>
        <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth
          itself as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it,
          is in the facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when
          you truly say:</p>
        <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they
          demand new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse
          that shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this
          he finds only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
        <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the
          private property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
        <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore,
          owes to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you
          mean God. Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred
          an obligation to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail,
          is the same as is thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion
          by the <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Bishop of Meath</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having
            created us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means
            necessary for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this
            kind now known to us. The land, therefore, of every country is the
            common property of the people of that country, because its real owner,
            the Creator who made it, has transferred it as a voluntary gift to
            them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
            as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God,
            and as
            all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
            of
            a country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from
            his share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice
            and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE
            TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS OF HIS CREATOR. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>

        <p>... We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and
          we differ from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding
          it as the natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself
          as natural and just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose
          on the rich any burden that is not equally placed on the poor; we see
          no evil in competition, but deem unrestricted competition to be as
          necessary to the health of the industrial and social organism as the
          free circulation of the blood is to the health of the bodily organism &#8212; to
          be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to be secured. We
          would simply take for the community what belongs to the community,
          the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community; leave
          sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
          treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all
          restrictions and prohibitions save those required for public health,
        safety, morals and convenience.</p>
        <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
          specially to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on
          the evils of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony
          of natural relations, which must be artificially organized or improved.
          In its idea there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently
          organizing the industrial relations of men; the construction, as it
          were, of a great machine whose complicated parts shall properly work
          together under the direction of human intelligence. This is the reason
          why socialism tends toward atheism. Failing to see the order and symmetry
          of natural law, it fails to recognize God.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <strong>we</strong> who call ourselves single-tax men (a name which
          expresses merely our practical propositions) <strong>see in the social
          and industrial relations of men not a machine which requires construction,
          but an organism which needs only to be suffered to grow. We see in
          the natural social and industrial laws such harmony as we see in the
          adjustments of the human body, and that as far transcends the power
          of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct as it is beyond man&#8217;s
          intelligence to order and direct the vital movements of his frame.
          We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation to the
          moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves
          the moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would
          wander and go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the
          evils of our time is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason
          why our beliefs tend toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent
          with a firm and reverent faith in God, and with the recognition of
          his law as the supreme law which men must follow if they would secure
          prosperity and avoid destruction.</strong> This is the reason why to us political
          economy only serves to show the depth of wisdom in the simple truths
          which common people heard gladly from the lips of Him of whom it was
          said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter of Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
        <p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to
          all men of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers
          and the removal of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise
          of those powers &#8212; we see the conformation of human law to the
          moral law, that we hold with confidence that this is not merely the
          sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly portray, but
          that it is the only possible remedy.</p>
        <p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations
          to the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say,
          the immutable laws of God are such, that it is beyond the power of
          human ingenuity to devise any way by which the evils born of the injustice
          that robs men of their birthright can be removed otherwise than by
          doing justice, by opening to all the bounty that God has provided for
          all.</p>
        <p>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
          of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and
          on which he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not irresistibly
          follow that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to
          others all right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor,
          the privileged and the helpless? Does it not follow that those who
          have no rights to the use of land can live only by selling their power
          to labor to those who own the land? Does it not follow that what the
          socialists call &#8220;the iron law of wages,&#8221; what the political
          economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must
          take from the landless masses &#8212; the mere laborers, who of themselves
          have no power to use their labor &#8212; all the benefits of any possible
          advance or improvement that does not alter this unjust division of
          land? For having no power to employ themselves, they must, either as
          labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for permission
          to labor. This competition with one another of men shut out from God&#8217;s
          inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation, and must ultimately
          force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life can just
          be maintained and reproduction carried on. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
        <p><strong>And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the great
          fund intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy the
          slightest tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they
          might be. Not only do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of
          property, but we see that by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the
          economic laws of the Creator, it is impossible for any one honestly
          to acquire wealth, without at the same time adding to the wealth of
        the world.</strong></p>
        <p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
          in other wrongs. Those who defend private property in land, and thereby
          deny the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right
          to the material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses.
          Either they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the
          hindermost,&#8221; deny the equal right to life, and by some theory
          like that to which the English clergyman Malthus has given his name,
          assert that nature (they do not venture to say God) brings into the
          world more men than there is provision for; or, they must, as do the
          socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are wrongs.... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... That the intelligence which
we must recognise behind nature is
almighty does not mean that it can contradict itself and stultify its
own laws. No; we are the children of God. But what God is, who shall
say? But everyone is conscious of this, that behind what one sees
there must have been a power to bring that forth; that behind what
one knows there is an intelligence far greater than that which is
lodged in the human mind, but which human intelligence does in some
infinitely less degree resemble.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When we consider the achievements

the misery that exists today in the very centres of wealth; upon the
ignorance, the weakness, the injustice, that characterise our highest
civilisation, we may know of a surety that it is not the fault of
God; it is the fault of humanity. May we not know that in that very
power that God has given to His children here, in that power of
rising higher, there is involved &#8212; and necessarily involved
&#8212; the power of falling lower. </small></p>

 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All- Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father&#8221;, the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There was a little dialogue
published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nothing is clearer than that if
we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty. No
one dare deny that proposition. But the people who set their faces
against its carrying out say, virtually: &#8220;Oh, yes! that is true;
but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,
cannot be carried into effect. What a monstrous absurdity, what a
monstrous blasphemy! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the loving God does reign, if
His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is. The people who deny
that there is any practical way of
carrying into effect the perception that all human beings are equally
children of the Creator shut their eyes to the plain and obvious way.
It is, of course, impossible in a civilisation like this of ours to
divide land up into equal pieces. Such a system might have done in a
primitive state of society. We have progressed in civilisation beyond
such rude devices, but we have not, nor can we, progress beyond
God&#8217;s providence. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is a way of securing the
equal rights of all, not by
dividing land up into equal pieces, but by taking for the use of all
that value which attaches to land, not as the result of individual
labour upon it, but as the result of the increase in population, and
the improvement of society. In that way everyone would be equally
interested in the land of one&#8217;s native country. Here is the
simple way. It is a way that impresses the person who really sees its
beauty with a more vivid idea of the beneficence of the providence of
the All-Father than, it seems to me, does anything else.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to me,
through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Just as society grows, so do the
common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. </strong>What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; </small><small>... <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I doubt not that whichever way a man may
    turn to inquire of Nature, he will come upon adjustments which will arouse
    not merely his wonder, but his gratitude. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet
    what has most impressed me with the feeling that the laws of Nature are the
    laws of beneficent intelligence is what I see of the social possibilities
    involved in the law of rent. Rent </span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-2"><small><i>(4)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> springs from natural causes.</span> It arises, as
    society develops, from the differences in natural opportunities and the differences
    in the distribution of population. It increases with the division of labor,
    with the advance of the arts, with the progress of invention. And thus, by
    virtue of a law impressed upon the very nature of things, has the Creator
    provided that the natural advance of mankind shall be an advance toward equality,
    an advance toward cooperation, an advance toward a social state in which
    not even the weakest need be crowded to the wall, in which even for the unfortunate
    and the cripple there may be ample provision. For this revenue, which arises
    from the common property, which represents not the creation of value by the
    individual, but the creation by the community as a whole, which increases
    just as society develops, affords a common fund, which, properly used, tends
    constantly to equalize conditions, to open the largest opportunities for
    all, and utterly to banish want or the fear of want.</small></p>

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </strong></p>

  <p>Our stage, of course, for making this study will be this world of ours, for
    it is upon this world that the drama of human living is played out, with all
    its joys and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its failures,
  with all its nobilities and all its wickedness. </p>
  <p>Regardless of its size relative to other planets, with its circumference of
    about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal who must walk to the station
    and back each day, it is huge. Roughly ninety-six million miles separate the
    sun from the earth on the latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this
    distance, the earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it
    spins on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are distributed
    far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and maximizing their benefits.</p>
  <p>Consider the complementarity of nature in the case of the two forms of life
    we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses of the two gases, oxygen
    and carbon dioxide, the waste product of each serving as the life-giving force
    of the other. Any increase in the one will encourage a like response in the
    other.</p>
  <p>Marvel at the manner in which nature, with no help from man or beast, delivers
    pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to their elevation, thus
    affording us a free ride downstream and free power as we desire it. Look with
    awe at the variety and quantity of minerals with which this world is blessed,
    and finally at the fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both
    animal and vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
    stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's crop;
    then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry pit or the seeds
    of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or, turning to the animal world,
    consider the hen who averages almost an egg a day and the spawning fish as
    examples of the prolificacy that is evident throughout the whole of the animal
    world, including mankind.</p>
  <p>If this marvelous earth is as rich in resources as portrayed in the foregoing
    paragraph, then the problem must be one of distribution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how is the land distributed among the earth's inhabitants, and </li>
    <li>how are its products in turn distributed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Land is universally treated as either public property or private property. Wars
    are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
    property.

  <p>George has described this world as a "well-provisioned ship" and when one
    considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such provisions as coal
    and petroleum as have occurred say over the past one hundred years, one must
    but agree with this writer. But this is only a static view. Consider the
    suggestion of some ten years ago that it would require the conversion of
    less than 20%
    the of the current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
    then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture of
    the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that that characteristic
    has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how is it that on so richly endowed
    a Garden of Eden as this world of ours we have only been able to make of it
    a hell on earth for vast numbers of people? ... </b><a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">Read the whole essay</a></p>

  <p> OR let him go to Edinburgh, the &quot;modern Athens,&quot; of which Scotsmen
    speak with pride, and in buildings from whose roofs a bowman might strike
    the spires of twenty churches he will find human beings living as he would
    not keep his meanest dog. Let him toil up the stairs of one of those monstrous
    buildings, let him enter one of those &quot;dark houses,&quot; let him close
    the door, and in the blackness think what life must be in such a place. Then
    let him try the reduction to iniquity. And if he go to that good charity
    (but, alas! how futile is Charity without Justice!) where little children
    are kept while their mothers are at work, and children are fed who would
    otherwise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs are shrunken from want
    of nourishment. Perhaps they may tell him, as they told me, of that little
    girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who, when they gave her bread, raised
    her eyes and clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Heaven for His
    bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think, of its terrible
    meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child, thankful for
    that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard? If
    not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
    bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
    to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths
    of the sea? &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll),

  <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries
    we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we
    take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization large
    classes should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority
    should only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toil. There are
    professors of political economy who teach that this condition of things is
    the result of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are ministers
    of religion who preach that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful
    Creator intended for His children! If an architect were to build a theater
    so that not more than one-tenth of the audience could see and hear, we should
    call him a bungler and a botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide
    so little food that nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should
    call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even
    the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great Architect
    of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature testifies, has made such
    a botch job of this world that the vast majority of the human creatures whom
    He has called into it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want,
    suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development
    of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely
    live! &#8212; Social Problems </p>
  <p> THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls
    only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit,
    and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking
    by the community, for the use of the community, of that value which is the
    creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to
    common uses. When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community,
    then will the equality ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have
    an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill,
    and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not
    till then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    VIII, Chapter 3, Application of the Remedy: The Proposition Tried by the
    Canons of Taxation</p>
  <p>HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social
    growth; here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress
    of society is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal
    force tending to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force
    tending to diversity. Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from
    which without the degradation of alms, private or public, provision can be
    made for the weak, the helpless, the aged; from which provision can be made
    for the common wants of all as a matter of common right to each. &#8212; Social
    Problems &#8212; Chapter 19, The First Great Reform</p>
  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; Protection or Free Trade&#8212; Chapter
    27: The Lion in the Way - econlib </p>
  <p>THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
    result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality
    and individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least,
    that the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome
    of an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the
    idea of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape
    show itself even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system
    yet admitted in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief
    was essentially a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign,
    theoretically the representative of the collective power and rights of the
    whole people, was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though
    land was granted to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved
    duties, by which the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back
    to the commonwealth an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation
    of the common right he received. &#8212; Progress &amp;Poverty &#8212; Book
    VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
    Considered</p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; Progress &amp;Poverty &#8212; Book VII, Chapter
