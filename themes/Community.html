  <p>Most of us want to live in association with others. As Henry George described
      in <a href="../HG/PP/SP/03_Rent_Grows.htm">The Savannah</a>, the advantages
      of living near others are considerable. When some of us can afford to keep
      more land than we need, as a nest egg for our individual future, or for the
      advantage of our grandchildren, others must commute long distances to get from
      work we need and enjoy to land we can afford to live on, and we may be forced
      in the process to live in relatively isolated places, where there is less infrastructure
      (e.g., sewers, city water, paid firefighters) and fewer amenities (e.g., a
      choice of grocery stores, a well-stocked library, established schools). We
      spend our time and money commuting, and have less to show for it. </p>
  <p>Of course
        some of us value being in a rural location, and would freely choose that
    option even if others were available to us. But many of us would prefer to

      Speculation Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In communities like the United States, where the user of land generally prefers,
      if he can, to own it, and where there is a great extent of land to overrun,
      this cause operated with enormous power. </p>
  <p> The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
      shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of the
      margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent, must,
      like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances through
      half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches
      the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead entry or pre-emption.
      He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is forced so much farther than
      he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation which is holding these unused
      lands in expectation of increased value in the future. And when he settles,
      he will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can use, in the
      belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow him are again
      forced farther on than the necessities of production require, carrying the
      margin of cultivation to still less productive, because still more remote points.</p>
  <p> If the land of superior quality as to location were always fully used before
      land of inferior quality were resorted to, no vacant lots would be left as
      a city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties in the midst of costly
      buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable, are withheld from use,
      or from the full use to which they might be put, because their owners, not
      being able or not wishing to improve them, prefer, in expectation of the advance
      of land values, to hold them for a higher rate than could now be obtained from
      those willing to improve them. And, in consequence of this land being withheld
      from use, or from the full use of which it is capable, the margin of the city
      is pushed away so much farther from the center.</p>
  <p>But when we reach the limits of the growing city the actual margin of building,
      which corresponds to the margin of cultivation in agriculture &#8212; we
      shall not find the land purchasable at its value for agricultural purposes,
      as it
      would be were rent determined simply by present requirements; but we shall
      find that for a long distance beyond the city, land bears a speculative
      value, based upon the belief that it will be required in the future for
      urban purposes,
      and that to reach the point at which land can be purchased at a price not
      based upon urban rent, we must go very far beyond the actual margin of
      urban use.

    12. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3. Of the effect upon individuals
    and classes</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital. ... </li>
  </ul>
  <p>...But the great gain of the working farmer can be seen only when the effect
      upon the distribution of population is considered. The destruction of speculative
      land values would tend to diffuse population where it is too dense and
    to concentrate it where it is too sparse; to substitute for the tenement
    house, homes surrounded
      by gardens, and fully to settle agricultural districts before people were
    driven far from neighbors to look for land. The people of the cities would
    thus get
      more of the pure air and sunshine of the country, the people of the country
      more of the economies and social life of the city. If, as is doubtless
    the case, the application of machinery tends to large fields, agricultural
    population
      will assume the primitive form and cluster in villages. The life of the
    average farmer is now unnecessarily dreary. He is not only compelled to work
    early
      and late, but he is cut off by the sparseness of population from the conveniences,
      and amusements, the educational facilities, and the social and intellectual
      opportunities that come with the closer contact of man with man. He would
    be far better off in all these respects, and his labor would be far more
    productive,
      if he and those around him held no more land than they wanted to use. While
      his children, as they grew up, would neither be so impelled to seek the
    excitement of a city nor would they be driven so far away to seek farms of
    their own.
      Their means of living would be in their own hands, and at home. ... </p>
  <p>In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well as
      a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made. His
      loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
      is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
      or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
      a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
      but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ....<a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

<p>        Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George,
    a themed collection of
excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend to advance in proportion
    to the mental power expended in progression &#8212; the mental power which
    is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book
    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</a><br>
            <br>
To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress through the water will not depend
upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted to propelling her.
This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for baling, or any
expenditure of force in fighting among themselves or in pulling in different
directions. <br>
            <br>
Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the first
essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater the possibilities
of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict becomes
greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an equality of rights
is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice) is the second essential of
progress. <br>
            <br>
Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees mental
power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law) prevents
the dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because our
society is characterized by suburban sprawl and is
therefore motor vehicle dependent, community is destroyed. George
Kennan expresses this well in the book cited earlier, but it is more
empirically documented in a recent article entitled "<b><i>Bowling
Alone</i></b>", which David Broder of the <i>Washington Post
</i>considered the most important academic article of 1995. The
author of that piece, Harvard Professor Bob Putnam, shows that our
communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
cooperative and communal nature. As Tocqueville noted, this used to
be the unique strength of American society; we're now losing it.
Suburban sprawl and the automobile play a large part in this. And the
reason we have these land-use configurations is in good part, to my
way of thinking, due to our property tax policies and our subsidies
to motor vehicle transportation.
</small><br>
<br>
<small>It doesn't take much reflection to realize that the practices
which we are following are unsustainable. This is true not only
environmentally but also economically and socially. Author James
Howard Kunstler recently has described in his book <b><i>Home from
Nowhere</i></b> how our cities are becoming not only ugly but
unlivable. The irony is also that, by having followed the legacy of
classical economics, we could easily have provided for all our
government services through taxes based on land value.... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The more cohesive the
    development of communities is, the greater the
    synergy exists among its members. Sprawl development not only increases
    the cost of transportation and other infrastructure needed to service
    these sites, it also reduces the extent to which people are accessible
    to one another. There is considerable indication that American society
    is losing this elusive quality of community. When Harvard professor
    Robert Putnam published his celebrated article <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span> in January, 1995, it
    was remarkable as much for the resonance that it generated throughout
    the nation as for the message itself. David Broder of the Washington
    Post pronounced <span style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span>
    the most important academic article that year. Putnam argued that our
    communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
    proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
    cooperative and communal nature.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">54</span></small> We
    used to be a nation of joiners; increasingly now we&#8217;re a nation of
    loners. As Tocqueville noted 150 years ago, affiliative groups used to
    be the unique strength of American society.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">55</span></small>
    Several hypotheses were offered in this and subsequent studies to
    explain the decline in the civic engagement of Americans &#8212; various
    demographic changes, technological innovations such as television, the
    changing role of government, the cultural revolution, and so on. The
    land-use and transportation patterns that have evolved in the post-war
    period are a factor as well. The concepts of neighborhood and community
    today no longer mean the same thing as they
    did in the past. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Much of the loss of scale communities is due to the fact
    that transportation planners have reconfigured the urban areas of the
    country to serve the automobile.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">58</span></small> It
    stems from a fundamental confusion between what geographers call
    accessibility and mobility. This distinction is explained particularly
    well in a recent text, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Geography
    of Urban </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Transportation:</span></small><br>
    <small>Accessibility refers to the number of
    opportunities, also called activity sites, available within a certain
    distance or travel time. Mobility refers to the ability to move between
    different activity sites (e.g., from home to a grocery store).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">59&nbsp; ....</span></small></small><br>
    <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
    <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>On
    the other hand, collection of economic rent, whether it be from the
    use of land sites, fossil fuels, fishing grounds, solar and wind energy
    settings, electromagnetic spectrum frequencies, airport landing
    timeslots, and or even air sinks facilitates their highest and best use
    while leaving less attractive settings unaffected. Where there exists
    the possibility that environmentally sensitive sites or resources might
    otherwise be exploited, then is the appropriate time to institute
    focused CAC approaches, and with more attentive and efficient
    administration for all involved. The practice of concentrating economic
    activity in the more limited footprint that pricing creates is
    consistent with approaches taken in ecological economics. This is
    because the economy is recognized as only one component of human
    experience and the world system, not coterminous with it. Daly, for
    instance, draws concentric circles to illustrate the proper setting of
    the economic system &#8212; inside the social and cultural system which
    itself exists in a greater ecosystem. Collection of economic rent has a
    centrifugal and concentrating effect on human activity and hence upon
    the ecosystem itself. It has a benign effect on ecosystems insofar as
    it effectuates a steep and identifiable market gradient between areas
    of heavy socio-economic activity and those that bring no price at all.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">And yet by facilitating closer contact
    between members of the human
    community, it also fosters exchanges of a nature
    that are outside the market economy &#8212; family relationships and
    neighborhood activity.</span>... <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to me, through
    nature &#8212; whether one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have
    the microscope reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water.
    Whether one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
    or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has been a
    contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So strong is that
    feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even people who deny the Creative
    Intelligence are forced, in spite of themselves, to talk of intent; the claws
    on one animal were intended, we say, to climb with, the fins of another to
    propel it through the water. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the laws
    of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we find intelligence
    we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact
    that as population increases, and improvements are made, and men progress
    in civilisation, the one thing that rises everywhere in value is land, and
    in this we may see a proof of the beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It means that
    the social laws are adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society
    where there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
    to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by labour.
    <strong>But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes place,
    as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase, and so does
    the necessity
    for public revenue arise. </strong>And so in that value which attaches to land, not
    by reason of anything the individual does, but by reason of the growth of
    the community, is a provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to
    meet that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <strong>Just as society grows, so do the
      common needs grow, and so grows this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided
    fund from which they can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken,
    without impairing the right of property, without taking anything from the
    producer, without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
    here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most monstrous
    of all monopolies. </strong>What does all this mean? It means that in the creative
    plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an advance to a greater and
    greater equality instead of to a more and more monstrous inequality.... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Weld Carter: <a
 href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">An
Introduction to Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Taxation </b><br>
  It was but a short step from the ethics of property to the ethics of taxation.
      George's position here was that as labor and capital rightfully and unconditionally
      own what they produce, no one can rightfully appropriate any of their earnings;
      nor can the State. On the other hand, land value is always a socially created
      value, never the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this
      is a value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
      the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs. Furthermore,
      to charge the owner for this value, in the form of taxation, is only to
      collect from him the precise value of the benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on products,
    George spoke of "...all taxes now levied on the products and processes of
    industry -- which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold
    to be infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of the
      justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith speaks of incomes
      as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and this is the ground
      upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly insisted
      upon -- that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of this idea
      is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by the state
      -- that there is a value created and maintained by the community, which
      is justly called upon to meet community expenses. Now of what values is
      this true? Only of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise
      until a community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with
      the growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists. Scatter
      again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
      at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises; with
      every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is, therefore,
    the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive
    from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion
    to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use
    of the community, that value which is the creation of the community. It is
    the application the common property to common uses."&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATIONS are not natural. Were it not for incentives
    to the contrary, people would choose to live and work in close proximity. This
    has been well documented in studies of every era and place.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></font> Only
    when incentives are put in place that induce people to live in other circumstances
    do they choose settlement patterns that are remote, less accessible, and
    alienating. Only in the industrial era and after have outlying areas become
    more attractive.
    Tracing the history of such developments makes it clear that they are a response
    to less livable conditions of urban life as they have evolved &#8212; the
    pollution of air and water, loss of nature, loss of privacy, housing deficiencies,
    and
    so on. In more recent years, differentials in taxation and the quality of
    services (such as schools) have also played a role in making the suburbs
    more attractive.

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 5: Reinventing the Commons (pages 65-78)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Trust and liquidity, I eventually realized, are just two small rivulets in
      an enormous river of common wealth that encompasses nature, community,
      and culture. Nature&#8217;s gifts are all those wondrous things, living
      and nonliving, that we inherit from the creation. Community includes the
      myriad threads, tangible and intangible, that connect us to other humans
      efficiently. Culture embodies our vast store of science, inventions, and
      art. ...</p>
  <p>Social Assets<br>
    The value of community and cultural assets has been less studied than that
      of natural assets. However, we can get an order of magnitude by considering
      a few examples.</p>
  <p>The Internet has contributed significantly to the U.S. economy since the
    1990s. It has spawned many new companies (America Online, Amazon.com, Ebay,
    to name a few), boosted sales and efficiency of existing companies, and stimulated
    educational, cultural, and informational exchange. How much is all that worth?</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s no right answer to this question.However, a study by Cisco
    Systems and the University of Texas found that the Internet generated $830
    billion in revenue in 2000. Assuming the asset value of the Internet is 16.5
    times the yearly revenue it generates, we arrive at an estimated value of
    $13 trillion. Another valuable social asset is the complex system of stock
    exchanges, laws, and communications media that makes it possible for Americans
    to sell stock easily. Assuming that this socially created &#8220;liquidity
    premium&#8221; accounts for 30 percent of stock market capitalization, its
    value in 2006 was roughly $5 trillion. If that much equity were put in a
    mutual fund whose shares belonged to all Americans, the average household
    would be $45,000 richer.</p>
  <p>Not-for-profit cultural activities also pump billions of dollars into the
    U.S. economy.A 2002 study by Americans for the Arts found that nonprofit
    art and cultural activities generate $134 billion in economic value every
    year, including $89 billion in household income and $24 billion in tax revenues.
    Using the 16.5 multiplier suggests that America&#8217;s cultural assets are
    worth in excess of $2 trillion.</p>
  <p>These three examples alone add up to about $20 trillion. The long list of
    other social assets &#8212; including scientific and technical knowledge,
    our legal and political systems, our universities, libraries, accounting
    procedures, and transportation infrastructure &#8212; suggest that the total
    value of our social assets is comparable in magnitude to that of our natural
    assets. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Capitalism and community aren&#8217;t natural allies. Capitalism&#8217;s
    emphasis on individual acquisition and consumption is usually antithetical
    to the needs of community. Where capitalism is about the pursuit of self-interest,
    community is about connecting to &#8212; and at times assisting &#8212; others.
    It&#8217;s driven not by monetary gain but by caring, giving, and sharing.</p>
  <p>While the opportunity to advance one&#8217;s self-interest is essential
    to happiness, so too is community. No person is an island, and no one can
    truly attain happiness without connection to others. This raises the question
    of how to promote community. One view is that community can&#8217;t be promoted;
    it either arises spontaneously or it doesn&#8217;t. Another view is that
    community can be strengthened through public schools, farmers&#8217; markets,
    charitable gifts, and the like. It&#8217;s rarely imagined that community
    can be built into our economic operating system. In this chapter I show how
    it can be &#8212; if our operating system includes a healthy commons sector.
