  <p align="left">The canons of taxation &#8212; the characteristics by which
    we judge the desirability of a tax &#8212; include <small>economic neutrality, </small><small>efficiency, </small><small>equity, </small><small>administrability, </small><small>simplicity, </small><small>stability,
      and </small><small>sufficiency. We also tend to regard as desirable that
      a tax be progressive &#8212; that is, that it impose a higher burden on
      those who are more able to pay. Land value taxation is progressive. Our
      most valuable land, which tends to be in the lands of the very wealthy,
      is in the central business districts of our largest cities. And acre of
      urban land can be worth 100,000 times what an acre of agricultural land
      is worth. Publicly held
      corporations
      own some, family trusts and real estate investment trusts own some. Ownership
      of such assets is highly concentrated in the top 5% of the wealth distribution.
      And our existing assessment systems undervalue those holdings by huge margins.</small></p>

Land Tax is the Perfect Tax</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It may therefore come as
a surprise to many that the perfect tax
to students of tax theory is one imposed on land value alone.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Unlike the conventional property tax which
uses both land value and improvement value as its base, a tax on
landsites satisfies all the criteria of sound tax theory. </span>It is
highly stable, regardless of the state of the economy. It can always be
set to raise sufficient revenue, without undue burden. Because land
supply is inelastic, it cannot impose any economic distortions and it
is therefore totally neutral with respect to all economic choices.
Whatever tax is borne is capitalized in the value of the site parcel,
without in any way affecting its sale price, which of course is
determined by the market. Most importantly of all, studies have now
recognized that a tax levied on land according to its value is quite
progressive, contrary to much conventional wisdom. ... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It constituted a progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. </span>It was efficient because it is
neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members....<a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">read

The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></small>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The average <span style="font-weight: bold;">house
(ex

($692.5/$39.6).</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seldom
will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</span></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What do those data tell us?
The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable.</b> The rich put a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive. ...
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>b. Reconciling
progressivity and motivation.</b>
</small><br>
<small>A land tax abates concentration of wealth and power without
limiting ambition or enterprise. It taxes wealth while sparing both
capital and income. It puts no cap on ambition and enterprise,
except to redirect those useful traits into creation, production,
hiring, and capital formation, and away from the zero-sum game of
land-grabbing.<br>
&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>It requires no incentive-warping progressive rate: all land is
taxed at the same rate, in proportion to value. The tax achieves
progressivity by using the observed reality that wealth rises with
income, faster than income; and landholdings rise with wealth, faster
than wealth. Otherwise put, the land tax offsets concentration
because ownership of wealth is more concentrated than income; and
ownership of land is more concentrated than other forms of wealth. As
George said, "The great cause of the concentration of wealth is
concentration of the ownership of land."&nbsp; <span
