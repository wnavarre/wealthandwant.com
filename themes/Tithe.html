  a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey:<a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html"> From
  Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In the book of Joshua, we find that although the Promised Land is a
gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even before the
actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed a
method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's
sight. The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with
human sacrifice and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive,
monopolistic social order. By contrast, Israel, to make good its claim,
had to institute a social order that would guard against the
desecration, pollution, and injustices of which its predecessors were
guilty, and would secure to each family and to every generation within
the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use of the land, of
which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner.</small><br>
<br>
<small>They began with a census of the tribes and families before the
conquest
(Num. 26:1-51). Every tribe, excepting Levi, and within each tribe
every family, was to receive its proportionate share, according to size
(Num. 26:55-56), and ultimately, to ensure fairness, by lot (Num.
34:16-29). The actual distribution, according to these provisions, was
concluded at Shiloh (Josh. 19:51). <strong>According
to ancient historian Josephus, the territory was not divided into
shares of equal size but of equal agricultural value.</strong> The landmarks
that protected these allotments were protected by the public and solemn
denunciation of a curse against anyone who should dishonestly tamper
with them (Deut. 27:11-16; 19:14).</small><br>
<br>
<small>As discovered again in our own
century, it is easier to devise a one-time fair apportionment of land
that it is to keep the system from falling apart. This is why the
ancient law established the Jubilee year. At the end of every fifty
years, any alienated lands &#8212; given away, sold, or lost from unpaid
debts &#8212; would be restored to the original families. Temporary
possessors were to be compensated for any unexhausted improvements they
may have made on the land. Concentrated landownership, and the division
of society into landed and landless classes, was thereby prevented from
creeping into the system. The
Jubilee effectively took the profit out of landholding as such, leaving
no incentive for speculation. When it was observed &#8212; and historical
records indicate that it was observed for long periods &#8212; the Jubilee
system successfully removed the root cause of poverty from the Jewish
society. ...</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>As noted, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the tribe of Levi did not
share in the equal division of the land, since it was charged with
carrying out religious and public duties</span>. Its members were
entitled to an indemnity from the eleven tribes who received the land
that otherwise would have gone to them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This indemnity was the <em>tithe</em> &#8212; one-tenth
of the product from the land occupied by the eleven other tribes.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, in principle, is the
formula for
a just land system in almost any time or place. The compensation to the
Levites maintained the substance of equal rights to land, alongside of
and compatible with unequal physical division of the land itself.</span>
As Frederick Verinder pointed out in his book <span
 style="font-style: italic;">My Neighbour's Landmark</span>, joint
heirs of a house may share it equally by occupying it equally or
unequally but "paying the rental into a common fund, from which each
draws an equal share; or they may let the whole house to someone else
and divide the rent equally." So it is with
land. Sharing equally in the economic rent or value of land through the
application of that value to common uses from which all benefit,
renders private ownership and unequal partition of land morally and
pragmatically benign.</small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The modern equivalent of
removing
one's neighbor's landmark is thus not the private ownership of land per
se, but rather the private appropriation of land value.</span> "The
profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic,
to assure everyone the same natural opportunity, asserts that all
people have an equal right to economic rent, and the Levite tithe
demonstrates that the socialization of rent offsets the ethical and
practical harm resulting from private land ownership. But there is
another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
should be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises
in large measure from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of
population, and community activity in a particular area. </span>More
people means more demand for space on which to live and work. Community
activities such as roads, schools, protection, parks, sewage, utilities
and other public services, as well as the totality of private
commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive or
desirable. It follows that a community which funds such improvements
out of its rent fund will be provided with a stable and growing fund
with which to maintain and improve them. And unlike conventional taxes,
the collection of this fund will enhance, not penalize, the production
of wealth.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare
capacity as
landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate
scarcity, artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any
positive contribution to production on the part of landowners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>While land value is not the only type of unearned increment,
unearned
income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not
at the expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of
property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx
could have -- but did not -- champion the abolition of land monopoly;
instead he advocated its transfer from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how
the universal principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be
applied to the modern age in all its economic aspects -- rural and
urban, agricultural and industrial, technologically undeveloped or
advanced.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to
leave
land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the
existing machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to
purchase or to confiscate private property in land. The first would be
unjust; the second, needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land;
it is only necessary to confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be
expropriated or evicted. No limit would be placed on the quantity of
land one could hold, as long as the annual rent were paid.</span></small><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the
capture
of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor --
improvements, personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. --
would be reduced and ultimately eliminated.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>George considered his
remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw the
growth of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as
an expression of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes
on... so do the common wants increase and so does the necessity for
public revenue arise. And so in that value which attaches to land, not
by reason of anything the individual does, but by reason of the growth
of the community, is a provision intended -- we may safely say intended
-- to meet that social want."</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way
to
stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity,
in the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land
speculation and monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes
can be impelled to serve the needs of the public via investment in
production, not by further investment in land speculation and monopoly.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Dependency theory, to the degree that it hits upon one of the
causes of
Third World poverty in exploitation by foreign investors, can find in
George's land value tax the constructive practical approach it lacks.
Neither erection of trade barriers nor legal restriction of foreign
ownership is called for. As one Australian writer puts it:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">(W)hen
investors from one country buy property in other countries they are
seeking <span style="font-weight: bold;">site rent</span>, which they
hope to obtain directly from tenants, or indirectly by selling land in
the future when the price or capital value has increased.... The site
rent that is so attractive to overseas investors can be kept in the
country quite easily - - by shifting taxation from labor onto land."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because George asserted, "We
must make
land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded as an
advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was nothing
of the sort. </span>The expropriation of land makes it practically
impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
which are their legitimate property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George's system
renders to the community what is due to the community, without doing
any violence to the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive
workers. </span><a
