<blockquote>
  <p>I
    merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
    talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
    agriculture and to agricultural communities. Nothing could be more
    erroneous. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is necessary to all
    production, no matter what be the
    kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
    storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
    he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
    Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
    given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
    upon it. </span>When this necessity is absolute, then does he
    necessarily
    become their absolute master. And just as this point is
    neared &#8211; that is to say, just as competition increases the demand
    for land &#8211; just in that degree does the power of taking a larger
    and larger share of the earnings of labor increase. I<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t is this power
    that gives land its value; this is the power that enables the owner
    of valuable land to reap where he has not sown &#8211; to appropriate to
    himself wealth which he has had no share in producing. Rent is always
    the devourer of wages. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
    owner of city land takes, in the rents he
    receives for his land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does
    the owner of farming land. </span>And whether he be working in a
    garret ten
    stories above the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet
    below the earth's surface, it is the competition for the use of land
    that ultimately determines what proportion of the produce of his
    labor the laborer will get for himself.  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is the reason why modern
      progress does not tend to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why,
      with all the inventions and improvements and economies which so
      enormously increase productive power, wages everywhere tend to the
      minimum of a bare living.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>The cause that in Ireland produces poverty
      and distress&#8211;the ownership by some of the people of the land on
      which and from which the whole people must live &#8211; everywhere else
      produces the same results.    </li>
    <li>It is this that produces the hideous
      squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this that makes want
      jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that forces little
      children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts mills, and
    that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps. ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor, especially
      they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything that is not
    fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves.
    The reformers
      in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working more than
    eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love
    to work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit
    to come
      here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came
    from.</p>
  <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
      the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
      of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
      are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria,
      instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the
      swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
      symptoms.</p>
  <p>Land Basic</p>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land
      man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
    must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single tax
    is applied.
      It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax
    does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man
    turned
      from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
      continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
    he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
    there
      were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
      there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the
      surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
      only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was
      complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a
      job.</p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the
      coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it, and cunning men
    know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped the earth;
    and they
      say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages and ages
      to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay
      the tribute I demand&quot;. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

<p>    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
  Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> classical economists</span> treated land
as
distinct from capital:
"land, labor and capital" were the three basic "factors
of production."&nbsp; They were mutually exclusive.&nbsp; They were
comprehensive, including all economic agents. Each was also
"limitational," meaning at least some of each was needed for
all economic activity (v.&nbsp; A9, below)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> They
made a coherent
system, like Humboldt&#8217;s Cosmos, in the spirit of The Enlightenment that
spawned them both.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic;">Neo-classical</span>
economists denied the distinction and undertook to purge
land from economese.&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Many of them, following John B.
Clark and
Frank Knight, still deny the distinction as I explain in <i><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
Corruption of Economics</a>, </i>a companion volume in this
series.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Many treat the matter by seizing on
and stressing all similarities of
land and capital, while ignoring all differences.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Some invent gray
areas that seem to fuse land and capital, present them as typical, and
quickly move on.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Many more simply ignore land, which
has the effect
of accepting the Clark-Knight verdict in practice.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Others uneasily
finesse and blur the issue by writing "land" in quotes, or
trivializing its value, or referring vaguely to "quasi-rents"
to comprehend a broad spectrum of incomes both from land and other
factors.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What ever possessed the
neo-classicals to
leave such a mess?&nbsp; One
needs to know something of their times and politics.&nbsp; J.B. Clark
and
E.R.A. Seligman of Columbia University were obsessed with deflecting
proposals, strongly supported at the time and place they wrote, to
focus
taxation on land.&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a>,
after all, was nearly elected
Mayor
of New York City in 1886 and 1897.&nbsp; Frank Knight, founder of The
Chicago School, followed them closely.&nbsp; That explains why some of
the points made herein may seem obvious
to readers who have been spared the formal conditioning
imposed on graduate students in economics.&nbsp; In graduate training,
however, the obvious is obscured, silenced, or denied.&nbsp;<span

themselves from the laity and advance their careers.<small><span

is melded with
capital, and simply disappears as a separate category, along with its
distinctive attributes.&nbsp; A number of economists don't buy it, but
don't do anything about it - acquiescing in error by silence,
indifference, passivity, or anxiety of the professional
consequences.&nbsp; They handle the question by "going into
denial," as it were, resolving a vexing issue by pretending it isn't
there. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Anything else spoils the

<small>The discipline has not totally eliminated land, but marginalized
it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The discipline has not
totally terminated land: it is too subtle for outright skullduggery,
preferring equivocation and confusion.&nbsp; Rather, it has
marginalized it.&nbsp; </span>There is a subdiscipline called "Land
Economics," and
a journal of that name.&nbsp; There are journals of Agricultural
Economics, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Environmental Economics,
Natural Resources, and more.&nbsp; There are also whole disciplines of
Geography, Economic Geography, Military Science, Biogeography, Geology,
Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Soils, Physiography, Topography, and Hydrology, all
dealing
with The Earth and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct
from
man's works. ...</small><br>
<small>Common micro theory finesses Time.&nbsp; It deals with economic
relations
as though they occurred at a point in time <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(and space as well); as though they
were relations of coexistence, rather than a cavalcade of events in
sequence</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes two points
are allowed (short run and long).&nbsp; Thus micro theory can ignore
the
birth of capital, its growth, maturity, senescence, death, burial, and
replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time,
and
relations of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite
of "finance," usually
not even taught in departments of economics.&nbsp; Time is also
referred
to under "history of economic thought," as an obsession of some
19th century Austrians who wrote quaintly of "roundabout"
(time-using) methods of production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5&nbsp;</span></small>
Relations of sequence are found in
macro, but not firmly integrated with microtheory, which is the
enduring
core of the discipline.&nbsp; Microtheory still deals with relations of
coexistence in time, and space as well. As A. A. Milne once wrote,
"It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead." Of
neoclassical theory we may add, "It isn't really anytime, it's some
other time instead."<small><span

<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">A compulsive trendiness grips
theorists, who produce new words and concepts monthly, raising
insurmountable barriers of communication.&nbsp; These seal off the
profession not just from the outside world, not just from reality, but
from itself, as it subdivides economic thought within elaborate mazes
behind ever thicker walls of new argot.&nbsp; Jesuits quibbling with
Jansenists in 18th Century France were never more arcane nor tiresome
than most economic theorists today.&nbsp; These elaborate structures
rise, however, upon the spaceless, timeless basis of micro theory
inherited from J.B. Clark and Frank Knight.&nbsp; They can be no better
than their foundations.&nbsp; Indeed, that is what makes them so
tiresome.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>All that is confusing for students and others.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Land does have
distinctive qualities for economic analysis and policy.&nbsp; This
essay
gives 10 primary reasons why land is distinct from capital (and of
course
from mankind itself) as an economic input.&nbsp; Then it gives 18
important economic consequences thereof, and their policy
implications.&nbsp;</span> Making land markets, land policy, and land
taxation
work well for the general welfare is a major challenge for economists
and
statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it too long by crediting and
following the peculiar neo-classical sophisms that obscure or deny all
distinctions between land and capital. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Landownership imparts superior bargaining power </b>Labor
starves, in contests of endurance; land endures.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>A
landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she can earn
income like any worker.&nbsp; Landownership gives income above that,
which gives <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discretionary </span>spending
or waiting power.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In contests with capital, land has the greater waiting power
because
over
time capital depreciates, while land appreciates.&nbsp; Thus landowners
(when free of heavy taxation) are noted for their patience.&nbsp;
Patience is the essence of bargaining power.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Because land is fixed, more ownership by one person or group
means less
ownership by others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt, unavoidably.&nbsp;
Thus, the expanding agent necessarily weakens others by the same stroke
that strengthens himself.&nbsp; Landownership often gives market power
in
the sale of specific commodities and services. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land income is a
large share of national income.</span> Throughout history the prime
business of
national governments has
been to gain and keep land, mainly by force and threats (cf.&nbsp;
<a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html#B-1">B-1</a>).&nbsp; The prime
business of politics has been to apportion lands
among the winners.&nbsp; A third business is then to subsidize them in
various ways.&nbsp; It is most inconsistent, then, when the winners of
all three battles counter tax proposals by pleading poverty, saying
their
land has little value.&nbsp; How little value it has may be gauged by
playing "what if?" What if the English, with all their capital,
were removed to Antarctica?&nbsp; What would be their national
income?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Less drastically, we might just ask what the owners would sell
England
for?&nbsp; A common way to trivialize land values is to play "what
if' the owners&nbsp;tried
to sell it all at once.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small>&nbsp;
What if, instead, we went to buy it
all?&nbsp; Much of it has been off the market for centuries, with
reservation prices effectively infinite.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consuming </span><b>land
means preempting its
time</b></small><br>
<small><b></b></small><br>
<small><b></b>To consume most goods and services is to use them
up.&nbsp; Land is
not used up.&nbsp; "Consuming" land must have some other
meaning, therefore, than the intuitive and common idea that consuming
means turning-to-waste.&nbsp; To consume land is rather to preempt its
service flow without impairing its substance.&nbsp; To consume land is
to
occupy it for a time-slot, which may be as brief as
beating a red light or (rarely) as long as the pyramids last.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40</span></small>&nbsp;
After
us life goes on, on the land once left to us which we then leave to
others. "Time-sharing" was not invented by the holiday industry but is
inherent in the nature of land and life.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>40. The other six
"Wonders of
the Ancient World" have all disappeared without a trace.&nbsp; Relative
to land, human works are evanescent.&nbsp; "Like snow upon the desert's
dusty face, lighting a little hour or two" they are gone.
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>How shall we measure land-consumption by owners, where no rent
is
paid?&nbsp; Is it purely subjective?&nbsp; Does it vary with the
owner's
mood and health?&nbsp; It is simpler than that, and fully
practicable.&nbsp; The essence of consuming land is preempting the
time-slot from others.&nbsp; Thus, holding land without using it, or
using it below capacity, is a form of consumption.&nbsp; The measure is
the market opportunity cost of land, i.e. the price times the interest
rate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Holding an urban site has been likened to holding a reserved
seat at a
play, sporting event, or concert.&nbsp; The ticket holder properly
helps
pay for the event, whether or not he is there to enjoy it.&nbsp; As a
result, very few paid customers fail to show up.&nbsp; Likewise, people
who pay cash rent for land seldom leave it vacant.&nbsp; Doubtless if
people paid regular cash taxes to hold land, they, too, would consume
(preempt) less.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read

    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse.</p>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. ...</p>
    <p>For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw
        for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for the
        supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
        the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
        the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,
        to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
        of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
        to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
        rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
        wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
        go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
        those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land
        and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among
        all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
        of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

    Partiality of Indexing Capital
  Gains</small><big> </big></a><big>(1990)</big></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not formed, like
        capital, by saving and investment;
        land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
        appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
        misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
        very reason,
        there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
        gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
        value is
        macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
        counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
        financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls). ...</small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    As to
        borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
    system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is. ...</small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    Ignoring land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
        of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
        formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
        in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
        investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
        incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
    rents and increments to land value.</small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount to ignoring land is
    minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
        one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
        fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
        real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
        value means more than half the market value because of assessment
        discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
        discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
        Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
        addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
        legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
    and other favored uses. ///</small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">... most of us resident in California
        have been through one or more years since 1976 when the value of our
    homes alone rose by more than our annual salaries. ...</span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
    </span></small><br>
    <small> We are not pushing for a general wealth tax, but for
        impartiality and accurate thinking about indexing capital gains, a
        policy that would protect some forms of wealth, but not others. This
        apparently temperate, common-sense proposal is in fact partial and
        discriminatory. Worse, it protects most where the macro-social
    benefits are least. </small><font><small><small><small><small><a

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217; <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Wealth Inequality</strong></p>
  <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal source
    of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource, its private ownership
    necessarily excludes large sections of the community from its benefits. A
    landowning class thereby gains political economic power. In George&#8217;s
    own time the social identity and power of this landowning class was distinctive.
    Those who could not afford to buy land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier
    few who could. By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
    created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners and redistributed
    throughout the community more equitably in order to address social goals.</p>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
