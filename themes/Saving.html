<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>We hear from time to time that the
  American people do not save enough.&nbsp; Few have significant amounts
  of money put aside toward a rainy day or toward retirement.&nbsp; (See
  Ed Wolff's work on Asset Poverty for particulars.)<br>
  <br>
  To the extent that people are living hand to mouth, paycheck to
  paycheck, they are generally unable to save.&nbsp; What are their two
  largest expenses? For all except those who have very young children (who generally
  have
  significant childcare expenses),
  the two largest expenses are likely to be for <strong>housing</strong> and for
  <strong>taxes</strong>.&nbsp; The Self Sufficiency Standard studies, for example,
  develop a barebones budget, and in many places, the sum of these two
  expenses can total 60% or more of the amount one needs to be self
  sufficient. <br>
  <br>
  For those who live in urban areas, the larger share of their housing
  costs actually represents payments to either a landlord or a mortgage
  lender (reimbursing it for payment to the seller)<strong><em> not for the house
  or apartment itself, but for the location</em></strong>.&nbsp; On top of that,
  even those at the bottom of the income spectrum must pay wage, income and
  sales taxes -- usually to support the very services which make the
  property on which they reside valuable, allowing the landlord to charge
  them a higher rent next year! </p>
  <p>So rather than providing for their own future needs and those of the members
    of their family, they are first providing for the wants of the previous owner
    of the land they currently occupy. How nice for the previous owner! (Do you
    remember the ad line from the 60s or 70s: &quot;Is this any way to run an airline?&quot;
    You bet it isn't!) And then we turn around and blame &quot;government&quot; for being
  too generous with these very people. Weird!</p>

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1)
every person has a right to himself or herself, and <br>
2) all persons have
equal rights to the natural opportunities that are not embodied in
persons. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The first
premise leads to the conclusion that taxing
people according to the products of their efforts or the products of
their saving can only be just if people voluntarily agree,
individually, to be subject to such taxes.</span>&nbsp; Taxing land, on
the
other hand, does not involve such an intrusion on individual
rights.&nbsp; In fact, taxing land is a way equalizing the advantages
of access to land, as required by the second premise.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>What makes it impossible to tax everything at the same rate is
that one
of the things that would need to be taxed is leisure.&nbsp; T<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">axing
authorities have not yet devised ways to maintain people&#8217;s tax
obligations when they decide to earn and spend less money.&nbsp; Thus
all systems that tax people according to what they receive (from
working or saving), or spend, generate excess burdens.&nbsp;</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">They do
this by making the incentive to work less than the value of what people
produce and the incentive to save less than the productivity of
investments financed by saving.&nbsp;</span> Still, systems of
&#8216;broad-based&#8217;
taxes (e.g., sales taxes, income taxes and value added taxes) generally
have lower excess burdens than tax systems in which a variety of
individual goods and services are taxed at different rates.&nbsp;
Actual broad-based taxes generally have exceptions and
non-uniformities, and these generally increase the excess burdens that
the taxes cause.&nbsp; Still, one way in which a departure from
uniformity in taxation can promote efficiency is that, if there are
some goods and services that are particularly likely to be purchased in
greater quantity when people consume more leisure, then a somewhat
higher tax on these can serve as a partial substitute for taxing
leisure.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In addition to discouraging
work, most tax systems discourage saving by
taxing the proceeds of people&#8217;s savings.&nbsp; This results in less
saving and investment.&nbsp; </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">With the passage of time, this can
cause a
very large reduction in the amount of capital in an economy.&nbsp;</span>
And
a reduced stock of capital generally means that labor will be less
productive and wages will be lower.&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> A tax system that taxed only
consumption and not saving would not have this com&shy;ponent of excess
burden.</span> However, raising a given amount of revenue in a tax
system that
did not tax saving would require a greater distor&shy;tion of the
labor/leisure decision than in a tax system that did tax saving. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Households choose the quantity of labor that is employed in
production,
taking account of the wage after taxes, their total resources, and
their preferences.&nbsp; (The wage before taxes is the marginal product
of labor.)&nbsp; The quantity of capital that is employed in production
is the quantity that households have chosen to accumulate, taking
account of the return to saving after taxes, their total resources and
their preferences.&nbsp; (The return to capital before taxes is the
marginal product of capital.) ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Existence
of land value actually lowers saving rates. </span></small><br>
<small>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land value substitutes for real
capital in portfolios and thus lowers the need to create real
capital.&nbsp; This is the same effect that historians have noted about
the negative effect of slavery on capital formation. It is part of the
&#8220;wealth effect.&#8221;&nbsp; (The other part is lowering incentives to work,
and raising incentives to allocate both land and capital to personal
pleasure instead of earning cash by serving others.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;High land values may also affect interest rates indirectly
by reducing saving and the supply of capital.&nbsp; The existence of
high land rents and values, like the ownership of slaves, tends to
satisfy the need for accumulation of assets without any actual capital
formation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising land prices are net income to
individuals.&nbsp; Most of net income is normally consumed.&nbsp;
"Equity withdrawal" is a common form that this takes.&nbsp; Another
form is letting land appreciation substitute for a capital consumption
allowance as capital depreciates....<a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> <span
