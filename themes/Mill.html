        heart and noble mind &#8212; he yet never saw the true harmony of economic
        laws, nor realized how from this one great fundamental wrong flow want
        and misery, and vice and shame. Else he could never have written this
        sentence: "The land of Ireland, the land of every country, belongs to
        the people of that country. The individuals called landowners have no
        right in morality and justice to anything but the rent, or compensation
        for its salable value." <br>
            <br>
In the name of the Prophet &#8212; figs! If the land of any country belong to
the people of that country, what right, in morality and justice, have the individuals
called landowners to the rent? If the land belong to the people, why in the name
of morality and justice should the people pay its salable value for their own? <br>
            <br>
Herbert Spencer says: "Had we to deal with the parties who originally robbed
the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter?" Why
not make short work of the matter anyhow? For this robbery is not like the robbery
of a horse or a sum of money, that ceases with the act. It is a fresh and continuous
robbery, that goes on every day and every hour. It is not from the produce of
the past that rent is drawn; it is from the produce of the present. It is a toll
levied upon labor constantly and continuously. Every blow of the hammer, every
stroke of the pick, every thrust of the shuttle, every throb of the steam engine
pay it tribute. It levies upon the earnings of the men who, deep underground,
risk their lives, and of those who over white surges hang to reeling masts; it
claims the just reward of the capitalist and the fruits of the inventor's patient
effort; it takes little children from play and from school, and compels them
to work before their bones are hard or their muscles are firm; it robs the shivering
of warmth; the hungry, of food; the sick, of medicine; the anxious, of peace.
It debases, and embrutes, and embitters. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book

    <blockquote><p align="left">THE common law we are told is the perfection
        of reason, and certainly the landowners cannot complain of its decision,
        for it has been built
        up by and for landowners. Now what does the law allow to the innocent
        possessor when the land for which he paid his money is adjudged to rightfully
        belong to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>another? Nothing
        at all. That he purchased in good faith gives him no right or claim whatever.
        The law does not concern itself with the "intricate question of compensation" to
        the innocent purchaser. The law does not say, as John Stuart Mill says: "The
        land belongs to A, therefore B who has thought himself the owner has
        no right to anything but the rent, or compensation for its salable value." For
        that would be indeed like a famous fugitive slave case decision in which
        the Court was said to have given the law to the North and the nigger
        to the South. The law simply says: "The land belongs to A, let the Sheriff
        put him in possession! " &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book

            COMPENSATED for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken?
              The demand of land-owners for compensation is not that. We do not
              seek to spoil the Egyptians.
  We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
  We are willing that bygones should be bygones, and to leave dead wrongs to
  bury their dead. We propose to let those who, by the past appropriation of
  land-value, have taken the fruits of labor, retain what they have thus got.
  We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease. &#8212; NOW,
  is the State called on to compensate men for the failure of their expectations
  as to its action, even where no moral element is involved? If it make peace,
  must it compensate those who have invested on the expectation of war. If it
  open a shorter highway, is it morally bound to compensate those who may lose
  by the diversion of travel from the old one? If it promote the discovery of
  a cheap means of producing electricity directly from heat, is it morally bound
  to compensate the owners of all the steam engines thereby thrown out of use
  and all who are engaged in making them? If it develop the air-ship, must it
  compensate those whose business would be injured? Such a contention would be
  absurd. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of Labor</a><br>
            <br>
            Yet the contention we are considering is worse. It is that the State
            must compensate for disappointing the expectations of those who have
            counted on its continuing
  to do wrong. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A Perplexed

            <br>
            COMPENSATION implies equivalence. To compensate for the discontinuance
              of a wrong is to give those who profit by the wrong the pecuniary
              equivalent of
  its continuance. Now the State has nothing that does not belong to the individuals
  who compose it. What it gives to some it must take from others. Abolition with
  compensation is therefore not really abolition, but continuance under a different
  form &#8212; on one side of unjust deprivation, and on the other side of unjust
  appropriation. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A Perplexed

rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the

profits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This led John Stuart Mill to
observe, that "Only the landowners grow richer, as it were in their
sleep without working, risking and economizing". He called for the
taxation of land in order to recapture the unearned increment accruing
to the land owners.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The apostle of land
taxation is Henry George. In his famous book <a

his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land. ... <br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If John Stuart Mill or Henry
George would be alive today, they would be disappointed that the
taxation of the unearned increment in land values has not made more
progress.</span> They would be surprised that the rise in urban land
values has not been as steep as they had expected. Yet the universal
use of automobiles has in an unforeseeable way multiplied the land
available for residential use. It has made possible the exodus of a
large pan of the middle class out of our towns into suburban areas.
Thus the invention of the automobile has upset the dire predictions and
expectations of the economists who advocated the taxation of land. <small><small><big><big><a

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Mr. Mill, in his great work
on Political Economy, after having
accepted the universally received definition of property exactly as I
have given it, says: "The essential principle of property being to
assure to all persons what they have produced by their labour and
accumulated by their abstinence, this principle cannot apply to what
is not the produce of labour, the raw material of the earth." And
again: "When the sacredness of property is talked of, it should
always be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the
same degree to landed property. No man made the land: it is the
inheritance of the whole species."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the remainder of this chapter
Mr. Mill lectures the proprietors
of land on their obligations and responsibilities to society in the
management of it, and consequently he must be addressing himself to
owners who have only the right of usufruct in their lands. Such
admonitions, if addressed to men who had an absolute right of private
property in land, would be simply an impertinence, as they would not
be obliged to account to him or to anyone else for "what they did
with their own." Further on Mr. Mill adds: "Those who think that the
land of a country exists for the sake of a few thousand landowners,
and that as long as rents are paid society and government have
fulfilled their function, may see in this consummation a happy end to
Irish difficulties. But this is not a time, nor is the human mind now
in a condition in which such insolent pretensions can be maintained.
The land of Ireland, the land of every country, belongs to the people
of that country." <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Landlord the Greatest
Burden on the Land.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The land is a commodity that strictly belongs to this class. It
is
limited in extent, and no human power can enlarge or extend its area.
The competition for it is excessive, the competitors struggling for
its attainment -- not for the purpose of satisfying a taste for the
fine arts, or to gratify a passion for the rare or beautiful, but to
secure a necessary means of existence: for they must live on and by
the land, or they cannot live at all. The owner, therefore, of that
land can put on it any rent he pleases, and the poor people competing
for it have no choice but to accept his terms or die in a ditch or a
poorhouse. Under the present system of Land Tenure, the owners are
not only enabled, but actually exact for the use of the land the last
shilling the tenant is able to pay, leaving him only what is barely
sufficient to keep him from dying.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr. Mill, who is the highest of
all authorities on this subject,
thus writes on the letting of land as it is actually carried out in
Ireland: "With individual exceptions (some of them very honourable
ones) the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain
it of its produce. What has been epigrammatically said in the
discussions on 'peculiar burdens' is literally true when applied to
them, that the greatest 'burden' on the land is the landlords.
Returning nothing to the soil, they consume its whole produce, minus
the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of
famine."&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

that exclusive access to land, and
especially to more land than one was using, was a privilege that
should be paid for, thereby eliminating the need for taxes. It is not

use of that land to everyone else.</small></div>

<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ...</small><small> <a
