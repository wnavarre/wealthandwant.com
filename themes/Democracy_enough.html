  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as through
      an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position fortified,
      and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social
      and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by its very
      simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
      of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one for
      an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized world.
      <strong>And back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an
      active, energetic power, a power that in every country, be its political forms
      what
      they may, writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast and dominant
      pecuniary interest.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which be must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the
    supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
    the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
    the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we live,
    to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
    of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
    to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
    rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
    wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it might
    go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition of
    those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value of land
    and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among
    all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
    of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. <strong>It shows that the
        evils arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are
        becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod.</strong> But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p><strong>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men,
        and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice</strong>.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
        offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
        so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice
        seems to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
        asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
        ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. <strong>Equality of political
      rights will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty
      of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. </strong>This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li><strong>poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns;</strong> and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li><strong> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the
            compliment of hypocrisy;</strong> and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p><strong>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when
        she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think
        of her
      as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have not seen
      her real grandeur</strong> &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her
      must seem rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of
      life, as well
      as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all
      growth, supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be
      a cold and inert
      mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty to
      mankind. It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that
      in every age
      the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have
      suffered.</p>
  <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
      national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. <strong>It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature. </strong>Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. </strong>This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe
    forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that is in every
    soul answers,
      that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something
    more august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep? ...</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It is the delusion which precedes
      destruction that sees in the popular unrest with which the civilized world
      is feverishly pulsing only the passing effect of ephemeral causes. <strong>Between
      democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable
      conflict.</strong> Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may be seen arising.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li><strong>We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then
            denying the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator. </strong>... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have here abolished all
hereditary privileges and legal
distinctions of class. Monarchy, aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept
them all away. We have carried mere political democracy to its
ultimate. Every child born in the United States may aspire to be
President. Every man, even though he be a tramp or a pauper, has a
vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any other man's vote.
Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In the name of the
people all laws run. They are the source of all power, the fountain
of all honor. In their name and by their will all government is
carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it
is possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for
our public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had
the preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that
here every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full
liberty of speech and of the press. We have not merely common
schools, but high schools and universities, open to all who may
choose to attend. Yet here the same social difficulties apparent on
the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to appear. <strong>It is already
clear that our democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of
equality a sham and a fraud. ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even if universal history did not
teach the lesson, it is in the
United States already becoming very evident that political equality
can continue to exist only upon a basis of social equality; that
where the disparity in the distribution of wealth increases,
political democracy only makes easier the concentration of power, and
must inevitably lead to tyranny and anarchy. And it is already
evident that there is nothing in political democracy, nothing in
popular education, nothing in any of our American institutions, to
prevent the most enormous disparity in the distribution of wealth.
Nowhere in the world are such great fortunes growing up as in the
United States. Considering that the average income of the working
masses of our people is only a few hundred dollars a year, a fortune
of a million dollars is a monstrous thing&#8211;a more monstrous and
dangerous thing under a democratic government than anywhere else. Yet
fortunes of ten and twelve million dollars are with us ceasing to be
noticeable. We already have citizens whose wealth can be estimated
only in hundreds of millions, and before the end of the century, if
present tendencies continue, we are likely to have fortunes estimated
in thousands of millions&#8211;such monstrous fortunes as the world
has never seen since the growth of similar fortunes ate out the heart
of Rome. And the necessary correlative of the growth of such fortunes
is the impoverishment and loss of independence on the part of the
masses. These great aggregations of wealth are like great trees,
which strike deep roots and spread wide branches, and which, by
sucking up the moisture from the soil and intercepting the sunshine,
stunt and kill the vegetation around them. When a capital of a
million dollars comes into competition with capitals of thousands of
dollars, the smaller capitalists must be driven out of the business
or destroyed. With great capital nothing can compete save great
capital. Hence, every aggregation of wealth increases the tendency to
the aggregation of wealth, and decreases the possibility of the
employee ever becoming more than an employee, compelling him to
compete with his fellows as to who will work cheapest for the great
capitalist &#8211; a competition that can have but one result, that of
forcing wages to the minimum at which the supply of labor can be kept
up. Where we are is not so important as in what direction we are
going, and in the United States all tendencies are clearly in this
direction. A while ago, and any journeyman shoemaker could set up in
business for himself with the savings of a few months. But now the
operative shoemaker could not in a lifetime save enough from his
wages to go into business for himself. And, now that great capital
has entered agriculture, it must be with the same results. The large
farmer, who can buy the latest machinery at the lowest cash prices
and use it to the best advantage, who can run a straight furrow for
miles, who can make special rates with railroad companies, take
advantage of the market, and sell in large lots for the least
commission, must drive out the small farmer of the early American
type just as the shoe factory has driven out the journeyman
shoemaker. And this is going on today.&nbsp; ... <a

  <li><small>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed;

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
has been the result? Simply that land owners get all the gain. The
wonderful discoveries and inventions of our century have neither
increased wages nor lightened toil. The effect has simply been to make
the few richer; the many more helpless! Can it be that the gifts of the
Creator may be thus misappropriated with impunity?</span> Is it a light
thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings while greed rolls in
wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few are surfeited? Turn to
history, and on every page may be read the lesson that such wrong never
goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that follows injustice never falters
nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state of things continue? May
we even say, &#8220;After us the deluge!&#8221; Nay; the pillars of the state are
trembling even now, and the very foundations of society begin to quiver
with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The struggle that must either
revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand, if it be not already
begun. The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new
powers born of progress, forces have entered the world that will either
compel us to a higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as
civilization after civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It is
the delusion which precedes destruction that sees in the popular unrest
with which the civilized world is feverishly pulsing only the passing
effect of ephemeral causes.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Between
democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there is
an irreconcilable conflict.</span> Here in the United States, as there
in Europe, it may be seen arising. We cannot go on permitting men to
vote and forcing them to tramp. We cannot go on educating boys and
girls in our public schools and then refusing them the right to earn an
honest living. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We cannot go on
prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying the
inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</span> Even now, in old
bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces gather for
the strife! <span

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[07]</font> Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual conversion
  of government into something independent of and beyond the people, and the
  gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &#8212; though not necessarily
  a class marked off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history
  shows, personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the concentration
  of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each
  knows his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city, as we
  have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers to gain and
  hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State
  legislatures, the growth of the country and the greater number of interests
  make the proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents
  know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
  departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.</p>
  <p>can seize power. The very poor have
  not spirit and intelligence enough to resist; the very rich have too much at
  stake.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
    of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
    by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
    but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
    any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
    misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
    continued to abhor
    the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
    at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
    more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
    political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
    in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
    day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
    what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
    government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
    something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
    free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
    their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
    The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
    the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
    suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
    see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
    without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
    vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
    How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
    of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and. urged by starvation, must
    bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
    tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
    I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
    to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
    of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize, and they listen to quacks
    who propose to cure the symptoms without touching the disease. &quot;Let us
    elect good men to office,&quot; say the quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds
    by sprinkling salt on their tails!</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[13]</font> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of popular government
    in the United States is clearly a failure. Not that it is a failure everywhere
    and in everything. An experiment of this kind does not have to be fully worked
    out to be proved a failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from
    the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our government
    by the people has in large degree become, is in larger degree becoming, government
    by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[14]</font> The people, of course, continue to vote; but the people are losing their
    power. Money and organization tell more and more in elections. In some sections
    bribery has become chronic, and numbers of voters expect regularly to sell
    their votes. In some sections large employers regularly bulldoze their hands
    into voting as they wish. In municipal, State and Federal politics the power
    of the &quot;machine&quot; is increasing. In many places it has become so strong
    that the ordinary citizen has no more influence in the government under which
    he lives than he would have in China. He is, in reality, not one of the governing
    classes, but one of the governed. He occasionally, in disgust, votes for &quot;the
    other man,&quot; or &quot;the other party;&quot; but, generally, to find that
    he has effected only a change of masters, or secured the same masters under
    different names. And he is beginning to accept the situation, and to leave
    politics to politicians, as something with which an honest, self-respecting
    man cannot afford to meddle.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
    of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
    it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
    earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
    to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
    gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
    is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
    the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
    competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
    their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
    in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
    a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
    the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
    doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
    time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
    chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
    due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
    in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

      (excerpt from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp;
      </small></a><small>(1883)</small></small><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A civilization which tends to
concentrate wealth
and power in
the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human
machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a
civilization is possible in which the poorest could have all the
comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons
and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies unthought
of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence that
will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are
already in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is,
yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of wealth-producing
forces. "Give us but a market," say manufacturers, "and we will
supply goods without end!" "Give us but work!" cry idle men. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The progress of civilization requires that more and more
intelligence be devoted to social affairs, and this not the
intelligence of the few, but that of the many. We cannot safely leave
politics to politicians, or political economy to college professors.
The people themselves must think, because the people alone can act. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is a suggestive fact that
must impress any one who
thinks over the history of past eras and preceding civilizations. The
great, wealthy and powerful nations have always lost their freedom;
it is only in small, poor and isolated communities that Liberty has
been maintained. So true is this that the poets have always sung that
Liberty loves the rocks and tile mountains; that she shrinks from
wealth and power and splendor, from the crowded city and the busy
mart. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The mere growth of society
involves danger of the gradual
conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
follow it. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small> But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the
changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of
steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the
concentration of wealth and power.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great
aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
the people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars -- except
two million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in
power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests. When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
companies deadhead [transport for free] President
[Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it.
Where legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where
justice is to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And
if, for this reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt
government to pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting
influence. A community composed of very rich and very poor falls an
easy prey to whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and
intelligence enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake.</small><br>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p><strong>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate
      the conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward
      democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. </strong>Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
  <p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the
    community.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
GREAT PARADOX</span></small><br>
<small>For a long time an idea was turning over in his head. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Why are salaries in new countries always higher than in
old ones? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do progress and poverty not only appear together, but
also drift farther and farther apart? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why are public as well as private charity impotent in
solving the problem with any permanence?
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do beggars, tramps and prostitutes cluster around
millionaires' districts?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In San Francisco he had seen the
growth of progress together with
poverty. A trip to New York showed him the process in its full
maturity. The shocking contrast between the most bare-faced opulence
with the most abject squalor turned into an obsession the need to find
an answer to the old question.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But he did not find that answer in New York. He found it in San
Francisco a few months later. During a horse ride in the hills east of
the city he dismounted to let the animal rest. Just to start
conversation he asked a teamster what the value of land was in the
district. "I don't know," answered the man, "but there is a man over
there asking 1000 dollars for an acre." What was happening "over there"
for an acre of land to be worth a fortune in the California of 1869?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The transcontinental railway was about to arrive. The land value
throughout Oakland was being catapulted to the stars with speculators
vying with each other to secure land titles before the arrival of those
who would need land to live and work.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"EUREKA!"</span></small><br>
<small>In a flash, George understood. Land value increases with the
increase
in population, and those who needed land had to pay for the privilege
of using it. But the land is the primary source of all that human
beings need to live. If there is such a thing as a universal right to
life, there must also be a universal right to the Global Commons
necessary for life. He who owns ends up controlling the destiny of him
who works. Words like "republicanism" or "democracy" may be
high-sounding, but empty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The remedy suggests itself. To restore the control of land to
those who
use it, it is enough to take the rent of it as a social charge with
which to defray public expenditure. The rent of land, instead of ending
up in private pockets, would pay for defence, administration and the
social services. Put it another way, let whoever occupies land pay in
proportion to the quantity and quality of value subtracted from the
common resources of nature, not for value added on them by his/her own
exertion. And let all receive the value of those resources in the form
of public services. Nobody would thus be defrauded of the fruits of
their labour, and the load of taxation would cease to fall on
production.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There was nothing new in that
flash of
understanding. He had independently arrived at the conclusions of
feudalism, of Quesnay and of Turgot, without having ever heard of the
three. </span>...&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Wetzel_Justice.html">
</a>We all have our own personal interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Similarly, let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in the
natural wealth of the nation. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

      effect of taxing absentee owners to spend funds locally&nbsp; </span>Transferring
      rents from absentees to be spent locally improves the State economic base

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our problem today, as yesterday, and the days before, back to the earliest
    recorded times, is POVERTY.</p>
  <p>There are times when this problem is lesser. We call these "booms." There
    are also times when the problem is greatly exacerbated. These are called "busts." But,
    as the Bible says, "the poor have ye always with ye."</p>
  <p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the core of the problem. It is not
    the position that there is only one single error afoot in our social organizations.
    There may be several, there may be only a few things to remedy. The position
    is, as stated earlier, that there is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore,
    the removal of this one basic error is the first, the primary step, for the
    simple reason that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
    will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust cycles until the economies
    of the whole world are wrecked by inflation or by a nuclear war triggered by
    the ongoing economic disaster.</p>
  <p>Let us begin this study of the likely causes of our troubles by asking two
    questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are we over-populated? </li>
    <li>Are the earth's resources inadequate for this population? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Our stage, of course, for making this study will be this world of ours, for it
    is upon this world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its
    joys and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its failures,
    with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.  </p>
  <p>Regardless of its size relative to other planets, with its circumference of
    about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal who must walk to the station
    and back each day, it is huge. Roughly ninety-six million miles separate the
    sun from the earth on the latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this
    distance, the earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it
    spins on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are distributed
    far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and maximizing their benefits.</p>
  <p>Consider the complementarity of nature in the case of the two forms of life
    we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses of the two gases, oxygen
    and carbon dioxide, the waste product of each serving as the life-giving force
    of the other. Any increase in the one will encourage a like response in the
    other.</p>
  <p>Marvel at the manner in which nature, with no help from man or beast, delivers
    pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to their elevation, thus
    affording us a free ride downstream and free power as we desire it. Look with
    awe at the variety and quantity of minerals with which this world is blessed,
    and finally at the fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both
    animal and vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
    stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's crop;
    then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry pit or the seeds
    of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or, turning to the animal world,
    consider the hen who averages almost an egg a day and the spawning fish as
    examples of the prolificacy that is evident throughout the whole of the animal
    world, including mankind.</p>
  <p>If this marvelous earth is as rich in resources as portrayed in the foregoing
    paragraph, then the problem must be one of distribution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how is the land distributed among the earth's inhabitants, and </li>
    <li>how are its products in turn distributed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Land is universally treated as either public property or private property. Wars
    are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
    property.  </p>
  <p>George has described this world as a "well-provisioned ship" and when one
    considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such provisions as coal
    and petroleum as have occurred say over the past one hundred years, one must
    but agree with this writer. But this is only a static view. Consider the
    suggestion of some ten years ago that it would require the conversion of
    less than 20%
    the of the current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
    then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture of
    the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that that characteristic
    has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how is it that on so richly endowed
    a Garden of Eden as this world of ours we have only been able to make of it
    a hell on earth for vast numbers of people?</b></p>
  <p><strong>The answers are simple: we have permitted, nay we have even more
      than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a viciously
      wicked
    distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed by those whom we, in
    our ignorance,
      have elected.</strong> ... <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">read

    Collecting rent for government-granted privileges would not only raise trillions
    but also
    whittle corporations down to a competitive size, less hazardous to
    democracy.  </p>
  <p>Besides charging what privileges are worth, government should also replace
    license with responsibility ("internalize the externalities"). To temper
    the temptation to use lands both fragile and valuable, society could impose
    surcharges
    - an Ecology Security Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and
    fines when users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
    would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from land titles
    is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each phase of such a
    revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its own way. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1. Get the rent. </b>Having to
      pay over rent to community makes speculation not worth the bother. So owners
      use their land and resources more efficiently. Using some land more intensely
      means using other land not at all. Plus, intense use augments the housing stock,
      lowering the housing cost. Pittsburgh, while taxing land six times more than
      buildings, enjoyed the most affordable housing of any major US city. More residents
      are owner occupants who choose to improve their homes, plugging heat leaks,
      etc.    </p>
    <p><b>2. De-tax wages and interest.</b> Removing
          such taxes while collecting rent moves investment funds in the opposite
          direction, from extraction and speculation into advancing physical capital
          and hyper-training labor. The resultant investment shift would accelerate
          techno-progress, helping us get more from less. </p>
    <p><b>3. De-subsidize favored
            producers.</b> Besides giving lobbyists a reason to contemplate a career
            change, abolishing subsidies would force producers to cut waste, to call
            on all the tools and techniques extolled by Amory Lovins and other green
            industrialists. </p>
    <p><b>4. Pay out the rent.</b> Getting
          money for nothing, would people still pursue mindless consumption of goodies
          or switch to mindful consumption of leisure? The pressure to consume stuff
          for prestige should be lessened by the increased equality in society. Everyone
          would pay in land dues equal to the value of the nature they claim and
          get back rent dividends equal to everyone else. These dues and dividends
          would narrow the income gap. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The conserver ethic would have a context in which to grow, since community
    is the crucible for morality. Stable neighborhoods put Pittsburgh's crime rate
    on par with a small town, by far the lowest in the US. Where residents become
    owner occupants, they participate more in community, even adopt environmental
    values. Pittsburgh converted its most valuable location, where the three rivers
    meet, into a public park. Not bad for a working class town twice named America's
    Most Livable. . .. <a href="docs/Smith_SS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed. ...</p>
  <p>The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
      themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
      they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
      states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
      are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
      claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
      what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
      and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
      In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
      they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
  <p>,,, The second principle to which I wish to refer is Henry George's advocacy
      of freedom of trade among the nations &#8212; not free trade introduced overnight,
      but freedom of trade as an end toward which the nations should move. When he
      wrote his great work on &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; he demolished
      the protectionist argument and in chapter after chapter he showed the absurdities
      to which the protectionist principle led if carried to its logical conclusion.
      But even he, penetrating as his vision was, could not foresee that mankind
      was heading for a world order of economic nationalism and isolation, based
      upon the principle of protection carried to its utmost extreme. And yet
      that it is precisely the doctrine which is now currently accepted. If it
      becomes
      general, it can serve only to sow the seeds of destruction of that measure
      of civilization which we now have and force a lowering of the standard
      of living throughout the world.</p>
  <p>There are two ways by which the people of one nation can acquire the property
      or goods of the people of another nation. These are by war and by trade. There
      are no other methods. The present tendency among civilized people to outlaw
      trade must drive the states which prescribe such outlawry to acquire the property
      and goods of other peoples by war. Early in man's struggle for existence the
      resort to war was the common method adopted. With the advancement of civilization
      men resorted to trade as a practical substitute for war. The masses of men
      wish to trade with one another. The action of the states alone prevents them
      from so doing. In prohibiting trade, the state gives an importance to territorial
      boundaries which would not exist if freedom of trade existed. In accentuating
      the importance of mere boundary disputes, rather than assuring the right of
      peoples to trade with one another, the nations put the emphasis upon the precise
      issue which is, itself, one of the most prolific causes of war.</p>
  <p>All the great modern states are turning away from freedom of trade, and indeed,
      from trade itself, and forbidding their people the right to earn their own
      livelihood and to associate freely with one another in industry. In order to
      accomplish this end they are compelled to regiment the lives of their people
      under state bureaucracies and this can be accomplished only by a despotic state.
      If the powers of the modern states are to be augmented by conferring upon them
      the right to run all industry, despotism is inevitable. A dictator may, by
      reducing the standard of living and regimenting the people, run all industry
      within the state over which he rules, but a democracy, which, if it is to be
      true to itself, must preserve individual initiative, can not do so without
      transforming itself into a dictatorship. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>
