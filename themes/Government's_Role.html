<blockquote>
  <p>IN socialism as distinguished from individualism there is an unquestionable
    truth &#8212; and that a truth to which (especially by those most identified
    with free-trade principles) too little attention has been paid. Man is primarily
    an individual &#8212; a separate entity, differing from his fellows in desires
    and powers, and requiring for the exercise of those powers and the gratification
    of those desires individual play and freedom. But he is also a social being,
    having desires that harmonize with those of his fellows, and powers that
    can only be brought out in concerted action. There is thus a domain of individual
    action and a domain of social action &#8212; some things which can best be
    done when each acts for himself, and some things which can best be done when
    society acts for all its members. And the natural tendency of advancing civilization
    is to make social conditions relatively more important, and more and more
    to enlarge the domain of social action. This has not been sufficiently regarded,
    and at the present time, evil unquestionably results from leaving to individual
    action functions that by reason of the growth of society and the developments
    of the arts have passed into the domain of <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> social
    action; just as, on the other hand, evil unquestionably results from social
    interference with what properly belongs to the individual. Society ought
    not to leave the telegraph and the railway to the management and control
    of individuals; nor yet ought society to step in and collect individual debts
    or attempt to direct individual industry. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  <p>THE primary purpose and end of government being to secure the natural rights
    and equal liberty of each, all businesses that involve monopoly are within
    the necessary province of governmental regulation, and businesses that are
    in their nature complete monopolies become properly functions of the State.
    As society develops, the State must assume these functions, in their nature
    co-operative, in order to secure the equal rights and liberty of all. That
    is to say, as, in the process of integration, the individual becomes more
    and more dependent upon and subordinate to the all, it becomes necessary
    for government, which is properly that social organ by which alone the whole
    body of individuals can act, to take upon itself, in the interest of all,
    certain functions which cannot safely be left to individuals. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

IT is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to

  <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</font></strong><br />
    <br />
To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and now,
in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in proportion
to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government must use
land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government is poor
to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits of good
government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many and fully
enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government are available,
or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest and most
available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would work or live
where the benefits of government are available, and does not already own land
there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other things
being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that the site
he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service of government
in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public which provides
the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. <strong>Land values are lower in all countries of
          poor government than in any country of better government, other things
          being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government.</strong> Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.
    But landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts,
    and of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and
    the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with
    the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their
    property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government which its
    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
        respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence and
        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
        exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
        for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
        if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down; they
        have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be 'held up'
        and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out in the spring,
        your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs, and if you walk you
        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.
        Isn't it worth a hundred and fifty dollars a year more for a building
        site here than over in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
        But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,
        what would be the conversation if your sense of the fitness of things
        were not warped by familiarity with false systems of taxation? Would
        it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
        the assessor. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
        your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
        for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire department?
        Are not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world?
        Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks,
        and electric street lights, and a first class water supply? Don't you
        suppose these things cost something? And don't you think you ought to
        pay your share?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or less calmness; &quot;I
        do have the benefit of these things, and I do think that I ought to pay
        my share toward supporting them. But I have already paid my share for
        this year. I have paid it to the owner of this lot. He charges me two
        hundred and fifty dollars a year -- one hundred and fifty dollars more
        than I should pay or he could get but for those very benefits. <em>He</em> has
        collected my share of this year's expense of maintaining town improvements;
        you go and collect from him. If you do not, but insist upon collecting
        from me, I shall be paying twice for these things, once to him and once
        to you; and he won't be paying at all, but will be making money out of
        them, although he derives the same benefits from them in all other respects
        that I do.&quot; <font size="+1"><strong>...   </strong></font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as <strong>Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the

    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q1. Do you regard the single tax as a panacea for all social disease?</em><br>
A. When William Lloyd Garrison announced his conversion to the single tax in
  a letter to Henry George, he took pains to state that he did not believe it
  to be a panacea, and Mr. George replied : &quot;Neither do I; but I believe
  that freedom is.&quot; Your question may be answered in the same way. Freedom
  is the panacea for social wrongs and the ills they breed, and the single tax
  principle is the tap-root of freedom. </p>
  <p><em>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value,
        how would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public
        needs?</em><br>
      A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
      values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth,
      are not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values
      of the state at large. </p>
  <p><em>Q21. Do not the benefits of good government increase the value of houses
    as well as of land?</em><br>
    A. No. <strong>Houses are never worth any more than it costs to reproduce
    them</strong>. Good
    government tends to diminish the cost of house building; how, then, can good
    government increase the value of houses? You are confused by the fact that
    houses, being attached to land, seem to increase in value, when it is the
    land and not the house that really increases. It is the same mistake that
    a somewhat noted economic teacher, who advocates protection as his specialty,
    made when he tried to show that there is an &quot;unearned increment&quot; to
    houses as well as to lands. He did so by instancing a lot of vacant land
    which had risen in value from $5000 to $10,000, and comparing it with a house
    on a neighboring lot which, as he said, had also increased in value from
    $5000 to $10,000. At the moment when he wrote, the house to which he referred
    could have been reproduced for $5000; and had he been capable of thinking
    out a proposition he must have discovered that it was the lot on which the
    house stood, and not the house itself, which had increased in value.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. Hasn't every man who needs it a right to be employed by the government?</em><br>
A. No. But he has a right to have government secure him in the enjoyment of his
  equal right to the opportunities for employment that nature and social growth
  supply. When government secures him in that respect, if he cannot get work
  it is because (1) he does not offer the kind of service that people want; or
  (2) he is incapable. His remedy, if he does not offer the kind of service that
  people want, is either to make people see that they are mistaken, or go to
  work at something else; if he is incapable, his remedy is to improve himself.
  In no case has he a right to government interference in his behalf, either
  through schemes to make work, or by bounties or tariffs. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q3. What is meant by economic rent?</em><br>
    A. Gross ground rent -- the annual site value of land -- what land, including
      any quality or content of the land itself, is worth annually for use --
      what the land does or would command for use per annum if offered in open
      market -- the annual value of the exclusive use in control of a given area
      of land, involving the enjoyment of those &quot;rights and privileges thereto
      pertaining&quot; which are stipulated in every title deed, and which, enumerated
      specifically, are as follows: right and ease of access to</p>
  <p> * water, and<br>
  * health inspection,<br>
  * sewerage,<br>
  * fire protection,<br>
  * police,<br>
  * schools,<br>
  * libraries,<br>
  * museums,<br>
  * parks,<br>
  * playgrounds,<br>
  * steam and electric railway service,<br>
  * gas and electric lighting,<br>
  * telegraph and telephone service,<br>
  * subways,<br>
  * ferries,<br>
  * churches,<br>
  * public schools,<br>
  * private schools,<br>
  * colleges,<br>
  * universities,<br>
  * public buildings --</p>
  <p>utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the character
    of the government; which collectively constitute the economic and social
    advantages of the land which are due to the presence and activity of population,
    and are inseparable therefrom, including the benefit of proximity to, and
    command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world -- an
    artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes. For
    the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently
    expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is ordinarily measured
    by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>
  <p><em>Q15. What should be the limit of revenue under the single tax?</em><br>
    A. The same as under any other system of taxation, the cost of government
      economically administered.</p>
  <p><em>Q16. Did not Henry George hold that the full ground rent of land should
    be taken in taxation?</em><br>
    A. No! Not only did he concede a margin of rent to the landlord, but as a
    matter of fact, as Thomas G. Shearman said, &quot;not all the power of all
    governments&quot; could collect in taxation all of ground rent.</p>

    to an absolute minimum, which, he said, the confiscation of rent would do
    automatically;

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or what
        in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot be
        shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given in
        the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the will of
        the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to
        things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
        by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the cost
        of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer increasing
        price
        by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such cost decreasing
        price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco or cloth add
        to the
        price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening in the cost
        of producing steel which improved processes have made in recent years
        has greatly
        reduced the price of steel. But land has no cost of production, since
        it is created by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly, by what the owners
            can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation and consequently
            of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor can earn on it beyond
            what is necessary to life;<br>
            2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
            particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
            by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
            for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
            3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
            in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from social
            growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to withhold
            land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never be shifted by
        the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase the demand
        for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding land from use.
        Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention because rent
        may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before economic or natural
        rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort
        from labor could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not
        left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent proper,
        to take from the landowners the premiums they receive, would in no way increase
        the superiority of their land and the demand for it. While, so far as price
        is affected by speculative rent, to compel the landowners to pay taxes on
        the value of land whether they were getting any income from it or not, would
        make it more difficult for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the
        full value would not merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. <strong>In that primitive condition ere the
      need for the state arises there are no land values.</strong> The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
      <strong>But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration
      of industry necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for
      revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable. </strong>The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    <strong>Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with
    the value of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what
    is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. </strong>Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality?<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better term have
    come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ. We regard them
    as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social nature
    of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature. <strong>While we see
    that man is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or
    can come
    from the interference by the state with things that belong to individual
    action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him,
    a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social advance, having
    an indispensable place in the natural order. </strong>Looking on the bodily organism
    as the analogue of the social organism, and on <strong>the proper functions
    of the state as akin to those that in the human organism are discharged by
    the conscious
    intelligence</strong>, while the play of individual impulse and interest performs
    functions akin to those discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious
    instincts and involuntary motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who
    would try to get along without heads and the socialists like men who would
    try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of their
    frames by conscious will. ...</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, <strong>protectionism</strong>. What support it has,
    beyond the mere selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more
    than their goods
    are worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
    is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor.<strong> Its
    methods involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery. ...</strong></p>
  <p>You state that you approach the subject with confidence, yet in all that
    greater part of the Encyclical (19-67) devoted to the remedy, while there
    is an abundance of moral reflections and injunctions, excellent in themselves
    but dead and meaningless as you apply them, the only definite practical proposals
    for the improvement of the condition of labor are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. <strong>That the state should step in to prevent overwork, to restrict
        the employment of women and children, to secure in workshops conditions
        not unfavorable
        to health and morals, and, at least where there is danger of insufficient
        wages provoking strikes, to regulate wages</strong> (39-40).</p>
    <p>2. <strong>That it should encourage the acquisition of property (in land)
        by working-men</strong>        (50-51).</p>
    <p>3. That working-men&#8217;s associations should be formed (52-67). These
        remedies so far as they go are socialistic, and though the Encyclical
      is not without recognition of the individual character of man and of the
      priority
        of the individual and the family to the state, yet the whole tendency
      and spirit of its remedial suggestions lean unmistakably to socialism &#8212; extremely
        moderate socialism it is true; socialism hampered and emasculated by
      a supreme respect for private possessions; yet socialism still. But, although
      you frequently
        use the ambiguous term &#8220;private property&#8221; when the context
        shows that you have in mind private property in land, the one thing clear
        on the
        surface and becoming clearer still with examination is that you insist
        that whatever else may be done, the private ownership of land shall be
        left untouched. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
    upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
          We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
          which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children
          of men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
          contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society
          must adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry
          George did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought
          and diction which has rarely been surpassed. ...</p>
      <p>Henry George never wrote a line which could be tortured into the support
          of the principles of the totalitarian state, or that gave sanction to the
          theory that men in their individual and social activities should be regimented
          and directed by great bureaucracies such as all our modern states, including
          our so-called democracies, have set up.</p>
      <p>Henry George believed in the state, but it was a state that was the
        servant, not the master, of the people: a state that was to be kept within
        bounds,
          and whose powers were strictly limited and to be exercised in subordination
          to the will of the people &#8212; a state, in short, such as is defined
          in our national and state constitutions.</p>
      <p>Machiavelli and Hobbes in their writings expressed the foundations for
          despotism, and disclosed the cruelties, subterfuges and deceits by which
          alone a despotism can be achieved.</p>
      <p>Marx and Lenin, because of their belief that the rights of the individual
          were fictional rather than real, built upon those principles of Machiavelli
          and Hobbes which constitute the foundation of the modern totalitarian state.
          'The whole idea of the totalitarian state, whether it finds expression
          in a system of fascism, either of the Italian or the German variety, or
          in the equally odious system of a dictatorship of the proletariat, rests
          upon a disregard of fundamental human rights and the substitution of an
          autocratic will for the encouragement of individual initiative among the
          people. The tragic menace implicit in the despotism of the totalitarian
          state, which makes it an offense to God and man, is its claim of absolutism
          to crush the individuality and destroy the conscience of men.</p>
      <p>The principles of freedom enunciated by Henry George are utterly inconsistent
          with the Marxian creed which ends in state socialism or in the totalitarian
          state, in principle identical with it. Indeed, the great French economist,
          Charles Gide, in his lecture on the cooperative program, contrasts
        a voluntary cooperative system, which retains individual initiative as
        the basis of
          all economic activity and preserves the spontaneity and inexhaustible
        reserves of invention and creation, with state socialism, which is proving
        daily
          more sterile both in economic production and in affording protection
        to public and private freedom.</p>
      <p>... Indeed, if we try to envision, in view of our present location this
        afternoon, &quot;The
        World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world
        of tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed
        into barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom
        which Henry George taught. The principles to which I refer are:
      </p>
      <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these
          rights may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction
          between what is justly private property because it has relation to individual
          initiative and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public
          property because it is either a part of the natural resources of the country,
          whose value is created by the presence of the community, or is founded
          upon some governmental privilege or franchise.</p>
      <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should
          be abolished as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly
          for private monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact
          that even where a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated
          in the public interests, it should be operated as a result of cooperation
          between the representatives of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by
          the politicians who control the political state.</p>
      <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created
          and perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish
          monopoly, they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot
          grant the privileges which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences
          by invoking anti-trust laws against them.</p>
      <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions
          which it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting
        a vital function which it should and can perform &#8212; the function
        of collecting public revenues, as far as possible, from those who reap
        the
          benefits of natural resources. In view of public and social needs,
        it is remarkable that no effort has been made by governments to reduce
        the tax
          burdens on labor and capital, which are engaged in increasing production,
          by transferring them to those who restrict production by making monopoly
          privileges special to themselves.</p>
      <p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
          forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value,
          is a task within the competency of government if it really desires
        to accomplish it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I&#8217;m also a liberal, in the sense that I&#8217;m not averse to
        a role for government in society. Yet history has convinced me that representative
        government can&#8217;t adequately protect the interests of ordinary citizens.
        Even less can it protect the interests of future generations, ecosystems,
        and nonhuman species. The reason is that most &#8212; though not all &#8212; of
        the time, government puts the interests of private corporations first.
        This is a systemic problem of a capitalist democracy, not just a matter
        of electing new leaders.</p>
      <p>If you identify with the preceding sentiments, then you might be confused
        and demoralized, as I have been lately. If capitalism as we know it is
        deeply flawed, and government is no savior, where lies hope? This strikes
        me as one of the great dilemmas of our time. For years the Right has
        been saying &#8212; nay, shouting &#8212; that government is flawed and
        that only privatization, deregulation, and tax cuts can save us. For
        just as long, the Left has been insisting that markets are flawed and
        that only government can save us. The trouble is that both sides are
        half-right and half-wrong. They&#8217;re both right that markets and
        state are flawed, and both wrong that salvation lies in either sphere.
        But if that&#8217;s the case, what are we to do? Is there, perhaps, a
        missing set of institutions that can help us? ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In his essay &#8220;The Tragedy of the Commons,&#8221; Garrett Hardin
        envisioned only two ways to save the commons: <em>statism</em> and <em>privatism</em>.
        Either a coercive government would have to stop humans from mindlessly
        destroying the planet, or private property owners, operating in a free
        market, would have to do the job. In the next two chapters I&#8217;ll
        show why neither of these approaches suffices.</p>
      <p>In considering the potential of governmental remedies, let&#8217;s clarify
        what we mean. We&#8217;re not talking about tyranny; we&#8217;re talking
        about legitimate forms of government activity such as regulation, taxation,
        and public ownership. Can these traditional methods effectively preserve
        common wealth for our children? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p>The notion that government should protect the commons goes back a long
        way. Sometimes this duty is considered so basic it&#8217;s taken for
        granted. At other times, it&#8217;s given a name: the public trust. Several
        states actually put this duty in writing. Pennsylvania&#8217;s constitution,
        for example, declares: &#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s public natural resources
        are the common property of all the people, including generations yet
        to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve
        and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&#8221; Note that
        in this constitutional dictum, serving as trustee of natural resources
        isn&#8217;t an option for the state, it&#8217;s an affirmative duty.</p>
      <p>Yet here as elsewhere, rhetoric and reality differ. Political institutions
        don&#8217;t function in a vacuum; they function in a world in which power
        is linked to property. This was true when fifty-five white male property
        owners wrote our Constitution, and it&#8217;s no less true today.</p>
      <p>America has been engaged in two experiments simultaneously: one is called
        democracy, the other, capitalism. It would be nice if these experiments
        ran separately, but they don&#8217;t. They go on in the same bottle,
        and each affects the other. After two hundred years, we can draw some
        conclusions about how they interact. One is that capitalism distorts
        democracy more than the other way around.</p>
      <p>The reason capitalism distorts democracy is simple. Democracy is an
        open system, and economic power can easily infect it. By contrast, capitalism
        is a gated system; its bastions aren&#8217;t easily accessed by the masses.
        Capital&#8217;s primacy thus isn&#8217;t an accident, nor the fault of
        George W. Bush. It&#8217;s what happens when capitalism inhabits democracy.</p>
      <p>This isn&#8217;t to say the United States government can&#8217;t, at
        times, restrain corporations. It has a number of tools at its disposal,
        and has used them in the past with some success. But the measures it
        can take are woefully inadequate to the task of safeguarding the planet
        for our children. Let&#8217;s see why.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
      <p>Does this mean there&#8217;s no hope? I don&#8217;t think so. The window
        of opportunity is small, but not nonexistent. Throughout American history,
        anticorporate forces have come to power once or twice per century. In
        the nineteenth century, we had the eras of Jackson and Lincoln; in the
        twentieth century, those of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty-first
        century equivalents will, I&#8217;m sure, arise. It may take a calamity
        of some sort &#8212; another war, a depression, or an ecological disaster &#8212; to
        trigger the next anticorporate ascendancy, but sooner or later it will
        come. Our job is to be ready when it comes.</p>
      <p>What constitutes readiness? Three things, I believe.</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li> First, we must have a proper view of government&#8217;s role. That
              role isn&#8217;t to run the economy, or even to manage the commons
              directly; it&#8217;s to assign common property rights to trustworthy
            guardians who will.</li>
          <li> Second, we must have a plan to fix our economic operating system,
                not just to put patches on symptoms.</li>
          <li> And third, we must recognize that the duration of any anticorporate
                    ascendancy will be brief, and that we must use that small
            window to build institutions
                that outlast it. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
        <p>Laws, regulations, and taxes are easily rescinded or weakened when corporations
          don&#8217;t like them. Property rights, by contrast, tend to endure,
          as do institutions that own them. So we should focus on creating such
        institutions and endowing them with permanent property rights.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake: it will take more than a few wand strokes to bring
          capitalism into harmony with nature and the human psyche. This is a
          thirty- to fifty-year project. During this time, we must be locked
          on a steady
          course. For this reason, I wouldn&#8217;t place much faith in slim
          and fickle majorities in Congress. As we&#8217;ll see, I would place
          it in the hands of commons trustees, empowered with property rights
          and bound
        as much as humanly possible to generations hence. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

        it has to find people to do them. It can add people to its own bureaucracy,
        or it can contract with outsiders. It shouldn&#8217;t matter as long
        as the public purpose is met at reasonable cost.</p>
      <p>When it comes to building the new commons sector, there&#8217;s plenty
              for everyone to do. Government in particular has four important
        roles to play:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Until it assigns responsibility for a commons to someone else, government
              is the default trustee, and should be held to trusteeship standards.<br>
            2. Government is the initial assigner and ultimate arbiter of property
              rights. Instead of privatizing nearly everything, it should assign
              more property rights to commons trusts and give commons rights precedence
              over capital&#8217;s.<br>
            3. Only government can broker inter- and intragenerational compacts
              like Social Security and Medicare. We need government to do this
              again for
              health insurance and the Children&#8217;s Opportunity Trust.<br>
            4. Government can help finance the reacquisition and restoration of previously
              privatized pieces of the commons. State and local governments in particular
              have the authority to issue long-term tax-exempt bonds, which can be
            used to acquire private land and water rights.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These four roles reflect government&#8217;s unique responsibilities and
            strengths. But there are areas where government doesn&#8217;t have
            a competitive advantage, and much of this book has been about one
            of them.</p>
      <p>Earlier I discussed the trusteeship function &#8212; the work that someone
        must do to protect our shared inheritances. We need this function to
        work right, because if it doesn&#8217;t, our descendants, along with
        many other species&#8217; offspring, are doomed. So we have to ask, who
        is best suited to perform this function? The evidence suggests that neither
        government nor private corporations can do this particular job well.
        So we&#8217;re left with trusts that are accountable to future generations.</p>
      <p>I suggest to those who care about the future: it&#8217;s time to delegate
        the trusteeship function to trusts.We should give the trusts clear missions,
        authority, and resources, and then get out of their way. The trusts may
        not be perfect, but they&#8217;re likely to do a better job, for a longer
        time, than any of the known alternatives. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><br>
        To build Capitalism 3.0, we each have unique roles to play. I therefore
          address the final pages of this book to a variety of people whose participation
        is critical. ...</p>
      <p>POLITICIANS</p>
      <p>Everyone wants your attention. Channel 5 is on line 3 and a powerful
        lobbyist is at your door. It&#8217;s hard for you to see the forest for
        the trees. What can I possibly tell you?</p>
      <p>What I want to tell you is, there&#8217;s a fork in the road. On one
        side lies capitalism as we know it; on the other, an upgrade. You must
        decide which branch to take. Your choice has vast ramifications. Very
        possibly, the fate of the planet is in your hands. Trillions of dollars
        are also at stake. I want you to be courageous. I want you to choose
        the upgrade.</p>
      <p>But that isn&#8217;t what one says to a politician. What one says is,
        we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs in America,
        and protect the environment. All those things cost money, and government
        doesn&#8217;t have enough. But here&#8217;s what government can do.</p>
      </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>  First, delegate to an independent authority &#8212; something like
          the Fed &#8212; the power to cap U.S. carbon consumption. That way, when
          energy prices go up (which they inevitably will), you won&#8217;t get
          blamed. Also, make sure the carbon authority pays dividends, like the
          Alaska Permanent Fund. Then, when checks are mailed to your constituents,
          you can take credit.</li>
      <li>Second, talk about jobs and energy independence in your speeches.
            And push for an American Permanent Fund financed by sales of pollution
            permits. Within
      a few years, thousands of people in your district will be installing new
            energy systems and cashing dividend checks. You&#8217;ll be a hero.</li>
      <li> Finally, tell your donors not to worry. You&#8217;re a low-tax, small-government,
        pay-as-we-go kind of person. You think the environment should be protected
        through market mechanisms. You favor an ownership society in which every
        American has a tax-deferred savings account and no child is left behind.
