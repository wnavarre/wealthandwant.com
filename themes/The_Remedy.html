    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while
        productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth
        and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to
        make wages what justice commands they should be, the full earnings of
        the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the individual ownership
        of land a common ownership. [footnote omitted]...</p>
      <p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is
        not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines
        its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is
        no better than other land which may be had for the using can have no
        value. And the value of land always measures the difference between it
        and the best land that may be had for the using. Thus, the value of land
        expresses in exact and tangible form the right of the community in land
        held by an individual; and <strong>rent expresses the exact amount which the
        individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal rights of
        all other members of the community.</strong></p>
      <p>Thus, if we concede to priority of possession the undisturbed use of
        land, taxing rent into the public treasury for the benefit of the community,
        we reconcile the fixity of tenure which is necessary for improvement
        with a full and complete recognition of the equal rights of all to the
        use of land.</p>
      <p>Consider what rent is. It does not arise spontaneously from land; it
        is due to nothing that the land owners have done. It represents a value
        created by the whole community.</p>
      <p>Let the land holders have, if you please, all that the possession of
        the land would give them in the absence of the rest of the community.
        <strong>But rent, the creation of the whole community, necessarily belongs
        to the whole community. </strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JUSTICE in men's mouths is cringingly humble when she first begins a protest
    against a time-honored wrong, and we of the English-speaking nations still
    wear the collar of the Saxon thrall, and have been educated to look upon
    the "vested rights" of landowners with all the superstitious reverence that
    ancient Egyptians looked upon the crocodile. But when the times are ripe
    for them, ideas grow, even though insignificant in their first appearance.
    One day, the Third Estate covered their heads when the king put on his hat.
    A little while thereafter, and the head of a son of St. Louis rolled from
    the scaffold. The anti-slavery movement in the United States commenced with
    talk of compensating owners, but when four millions of slaves were emancipated,
    the owners got no compensation, nor did they clamor for any. And by the time
    the people of any such country as England or the United States are sufficiently
    aroused to the injustice and disadvantages of individual ownership of land
    to induce them to attempt its nationalization, they will be sufficiently
    aroused to nationalize it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase.
    They will not trouble themselves about compensating the proprietors of land. &#8212;<em> </em><em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>IT requires reflection to see that manifold effects result from a single
    cause, and that the remedy for a multitude of evils may lie in one simple
    reform. As in the infancy of medicine, men were disposed to think each distinct
    symptom called for a distinct remedy, so when thought begins to turn to social
    subjects there is a disposition to seek a special cure for every ill, or
    else (another form of the same short-sightedness) to imagine the only adequate
    remedy to be something which presupposes the absence of those ills; as, for
    instance, that all men should be good, as the cure for vice and crime; or
    that all men should be provided for by the State, as the cure for poverty. &#8212; <em>Protection

<p>John Dewey: <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">Steps to Economic Recovery</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The one thing uppermost in the minds of everybody today is the appalling existence
      of want in the midst of plenty, of millions of unemployed in the midst of idle
      billions of hoarded money and unused credit, as well as factories and mills
      deteriorating for lack of use, of hunger while farmers are burning grain for
      fuel. ... </p>
  <p>Henry George called attention to this situation over fifty years ago. The
      contradiction between increasing plenty, increase of potential security--and
      actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief work, Progress
      and Poverty. That is what his book is about. It is a record of the fact that
      as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty and insecurity
      also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires and tramps multiply
      together. It is a prediction of why this state of affairs will continue; it
      is a prediction of the plight in which the nation finds itself to-day. At the
      same time it is the explanation of why this condition is artificial, man-made,
      unnecessary, and how it can be remedied. So I suggest that as a beginning of
      the first steps to permanent recovery there be a nationwide revival of interest
      in the writings and teachings of Henry George and that there be such an enlightenment
      of public opinion that our representatives in legislatures and public places
      be compelled to adopt the changes he urged. ... </p>
  <p>Go to the work of Henry George himself and learn how many of the troubles
      from which society still suffers, and suffers increasingly, are due to the
      fact that a few have monopolized the land, and that in consequence they have
      the power to dictate to others access to the land and to its products -- which
      include waterpower, electricity, coal, iron and all minerals, as well as the
      foods that sustain life -- and that they have the power to appropriate to their
      private use the values that the industry, the civilized order, the very benefactions,
      of others produce. This wrong is at the very basis of our present social and
      economic chaos, and until it is righted, all steps toward economic recovery
      may be temporarily helpful while in the long run useless. ... </p>
  <p>Consequently instead of attempting a technical explanation of the moral and
      economic philosophy of Henry George, I want to urge my hearers to acquaint
      themselves with his own works, to study them and then to organize to see that
      his principle is carried into effect. What are the most evident sore spots
      of the present? The answer is clear. Unemployment; extreme inequality in the
      distribution of the national income; enormous fixed charges in the way of interest
      on debts; a crazy, cumbrous, inequitable tax system that puts the burden on
      the consumer, and the ultimate producer, and lets off the parasites, exploiters
      and the privileged, -- who ought to be relieved entirely of their gorged excess,
      -- very lightly, and indeed in many cases, as in that of the tariff, pays them
      a premium for imposing a burden on honest industry and on the means of production;
      a vicious and incompetent banking system, with billions of money, the hope
      for the future of millions of hard-working peoples, still locked up, while
      the depositors lose their homes and walk the streets in vain; the greater part
      of our population, in the nation of the earth most favored by nature, still
      living either in slums or in homes without the improvements indispensable to
      a healthy and civilized life.</p>
  <p>You cannot study Henry George without learning how intimately each of these
      wrongs and evils is bound up with our land system. One of our great national
      weaknesses is speculation. Everybody recognizes that fact in the stock market
      orgy of our late boom days. Only a few realize the extent to which speculation
      in land is the source of many troubles of the farmer, the part it has played
      in loading banks and insurance companies with frozen assets and compelling
      the closing of thousands of banks, nor how the high rents, the unpayable mortgages
      and the slums of the cities are connected with speculation in land values.
      All authorities on public works hold that the most fruitful field for them
      is slum clearance and better housing. Yet only a few seem to realize that with
      our present situation this improvement will put a bonus in the pockets of landlords,
      and the land speculator will be the one to profit financially--for after all,
      buildings are built on land.</p>
  <p>So with taxation. There are all sorts of tinkering going on, but the tinkers
      and patchers shut their eyes to the fact that the socially produced annual
      value of land -- not of improvements, but of ground-rent value -- is about
      five billion dollars, and that its appropriation by those who create it,
    the community, would at once relieve the tax burden and ultimately would
    solve
      the tax problem. Of late the federal government has concerned itself with
    the problems of home ownership, but again by methods of tinkering that may
    easily
      in the long run do more harm than good. The community's acquisition of
    its own creation, ground-rent value, would both reduce the price of land
    and entirely
      eliminate taxes on improvement, thus making ownership easier. And how anyone
      expects to solve the unemployment question by putting the sanction of both
      legality and high pecuniary reward upon the ability of the few to keep
    the many from equal access to land and to the raw material, without which
    labor
      is impossible, I do not see -- and no one else does. For the tinkerers
    assume that unemployment must continues, only with government assistance
    to those
      who are necessarily out of work. By all means let us help those that now
    need it, but for the future let us prevent the cause instead of merely mitigating
      the effects. ...</p>
  <p>I do not claim that George's remedy is a panacea that will cure by itself
      all our ailments. But I do claim that we cannot get rid of our basic troubles
      without it. I would make exactly the same concession and same claim that Henry
      George himself made: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I do not say that in the recognition of the equal
            and unalienable right of each human being to the natural elements from
        which life must be supported and wants satisfied, lies the solution of all
        social
            problems. I fully recognize that even after we do this, much will remain
          to do. We might recognize the equal right to land, and yet tyranny and
        spoilation be continued. But whatever else we do, as along as we fail to
        recognize the
          equal right to the elements of nature, nothing will avail to remedy that
        unnatural inequality
          in the distribution of wealth which is fraught with so much evil and danger.
          Reform as we may, until we make this fundamental reform, our material progress
          can but tend to differentiate our people into the monstrously rich and
        frightfully poor. Whatever be the increase of wealth, the masses will still
        be ground toward
          the point of bare subsistence &#8212; we must still have our great criminal
        classes, our paupers and our tramps, men and women driven to degradation
        and desperation
          from inability to make an honest living.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
When I taught at the <a href="http://www.henrygeorgeschool.org/">Henry
George School in New York</a>, our
Director, George Collins, used to give a stirring graduation speech
to students. He told them they would find that the gift of insight
they'd been given, in studying Georgist political economy, was also a
kind of curse: they would never look upon their city with the same
eyes. The land question and its ramifications, the malignant
absurdities of today's economic systems and the sheer obviousness of
the remedy, would shout at them in every day's news.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I was reminded of that when I recently visited New York.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists note in this budget
crunch, as in others the city has
faced, a curious disconnect between the fiscal crisis and the overall
economy. Tax receipts are way down and the budget outlook is indeed
scary, even while the underlying economy actually lurches toward
recovery. If it weren't for the large declines in the (admittedly,
very important) financial and tourism sectors, the city's economy
would not be performing badly at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How
unfortunate, then, that New
York will see no other alternative than to choke off economic
recovery by raising income and sales taxes while cutting back on
public services. But what can they do? The tax base is declining.</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or is it? It
turns out that land values
in New York, while
modestly down in some areas, have not taken anywhere near the beating
that the Stock Market has, or the small business community, or public
services. No, the real estate market in New York City remains, all in
all, quite bullish. There are few bargains to be had. Residential
rents, of course, having been held artificially low by rent
stabilization, provide no relief even in a weak market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, no -- despite the dire
warnings, New York City need not endure
a fiscal crisis. Its tax base -- properly defined -- is robustly
capable of providing for public needs, while actually bringing
business into the city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They have
just been taxing the wrong things,
all along. Tourists, bulls and bears come and go, but New York City's
land values -- like its citizens -- are quite resilient.</span></small>

<p>Clarence Darrow: <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">The Land Belongs
    To The People</a> (1916)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This earth is a little raft moving in the endless sea of space, and the
    mass of its human inhabitants are hanging on as best they can. It is as if
    some
      raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be floating on the ocean, and
    a few of the strongest and most powerful would take all the raft they could
    get
      and leave the most of the people, especially the ones who did the work,
    hanging to the edges by their eyebrows. These men who have taken possession
    of this
      raft, this little planet in this endless space, are not even content with
    taking all there is and leaving the rest barely enough to hold onto, but
    they think
      so much of themselves and their brief day that while they live they must
    make rules and laws and regulations that parcel out the earth for thousands
    of years
      after they are dead and, gone, so that their descendants and others of
    their kind may do in the tenth generation exactly what they are doing today &#8212; keeping
      the earth and all the good things of the earth and compelling the great
    mass of mankind to toil for them.</p>
  <p>Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back? Everybody who thinks
      knows that private ownership of the land is wrong. If ten thousand men
    can own America, then one man can own it, and if one man may own it he may
    take
      all that the rest produce or he may kill them if he sees fit. It is inconsistent
      with the spirit of manhood. No person who thinks can doubt but that he
    was born upon this planet with the same birthright that came to every man
    born
      like him. And it is for him to defend that birthright. And the man who
    will not defend it, whatever the cost, is fitted only to be a slave. The
    earth belongs
      to the people &#8212; if they can get it &#8212; because if you cannot
      get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not, and
      if you
      can get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not,
      you just take it. The earth has been taken from the many by the few. It
      made no
      difference that they had no right to it; they took it.</p>
  <p>Now, there are some methods of getting access to the earth which are easier
      than others. The easiest, perhaps, that has been contrived is by means of taxation
      of the land values and land values alone; and I need only say a little upon
      that question. One trouble with it which makes it almost impossible to achieve,
      is that it is so simple and so easy. You cannot get people to do anything that
      is simple; they want it complex so they can be fooled.</p>
  <p>Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really believe in the common
      ownership of land is that the public should take not alone taxation from
    the land, but the public should take to itself the whole value of the land
    that
      has been created by the public &#8212; should take it all. It should be a part
      of the public wealth, should be used for public improvements, for pensions,
      and belong to the people who create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine
      in these strange times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by
      taxation. All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
      and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is so simple,
      and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if it is simple &#8212; that
      it is the easiest substantial reform for men to accomplish, and when it
      is done this great problem of poverty, the problem of the ages, will be
      almost
      solved. We may need go farther. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read

            as landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
            use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate scarcity,
            artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any positive contribution
          to production on the part of landowners.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>While land value is not the only type of unearned increment, unearned
            income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not at the
            expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of property in land
            is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx could have -- but did not
            -- champion the abolition of land monopoly; instead he advocated its transfer
            from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how the universal
            principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be applied to the modern
            age in all its economic aspects -- rural and urban, agricultural and industrial,
          technologically undeveloped or advanced.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to leave
            land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the existing
            machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to purchase or to
            confiscate private property in land. The first would be unjust; the second,
            needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to
            confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be expropriated or evicted. No limit
            would be placed on the quantity of land one could hold, as long as the annual
          rent were paid.</span></small><br>
          <br style="text-decoration: underline;">
          <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the capture
            of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor -- improvements,
            personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. -- would be reduced and
          ultimately eliminated.</span></small><br>
          <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
          <small>George considered his remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw the growth
            of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as an expression
            of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes on... so do the common
            wants increase and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in
            that value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the individual
            does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a provision intended
          -- we may safely say intended -- to meet that social want."</small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way to
            stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity, in
            the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land speculation and
            monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes can be impelled to
            serve the needs of the public via investment in production, not by further
          investment in land speculation and monopoly.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Dependency theory, to the degree that it hits upon one of the causes
            of Third World poverty in exploitation by foreign investors, can find in George's
            land value tax the constructive practical approach it lacks. Neither erection
            of trade barriers nor legal restriction of foreign ownership is called for.
          As one Australian writer puts it:</small>  </p>

      The site rent that is so attractive to overseas investors can be kept in
      the country quite easily - - by shifting taxation from labor onto land."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because George asserted, "We must

    expropriation of land makes it practically impossible to fairly compensate
    people for the improvements to land, which are their legitimate property. <span

<blockquote>
  <p>          <b>The Remedy</b></p>
        <p>The equal right of all men and women to the use of land is as clear as their
          equal right to breathe the air. It is a right proclaimed by the fact of their
          existence. For we cannot suppose that some men and women have a right to be
        in this world and others do not.</p>
        <p>Any one human being who appropriates to himself or herself the individual
          right to the land of any community or country, could legally expel therefrom
          all the rest of its inhabitants. If you extend this right to the whole surface
        of the globe, where would non-landowning human beings have the right to live?</p>
        <p>This supposition is occurring on a growing scale, realized in actual fact.
          The comparative handful of proprietors who own large surfaces of the U.S. are
          doing only what federal, state, and local laws give them full power to do (and
          what many of them have done already), excluding millions of American people
          from their natural birthright, the land. And such exclusions are as repugnant
          to natural right as the spectacle of the vast body of the American people being
          compelled to pay such enormous sums to the few landowners of their number for
          the privilege of being permitted to live upon and use the land which they,
          the landowners, so fondly call their own; which is endeared to them by memories
          so tender and so glorious, and for which they are held in duty bound, if need
        be, to spill their blood and lay down their lives.</p>
        <p>Place one hundred men and women on an island from which there is no escape,
          and whether you make one the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine, or the
          absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference either to
        the chosen one or to the other ninety-nine.</p>
        <p>It was not nobility that gave land, but the possession of land that gave nobility.</p>
        <p>What is being proposed here is a simple yet sovereign remedy, which will raise
          wages, increase earnings of capital and give remunerative employment to whomever
          wishes it. The proposal is to appropriate land rent for public revenue, rather
        than rob producers of their rightful earnings by punitive taxation.</p>
        <p>Now, as the taking of rent, or land value, must be increased as we abolish
          other "taxes," we may put the proposition in practical form by proposing
          to abolish all taxation and derive all public revenue from a legitimate
          charge
        upon land location values.</p>
        <p>"Taxation," which lessens the reward of the producer, necessarily lessens
          the incentive to production. Thus, taxation which diminishes the earnings of
          the laborer or the returns to the capitalist tends to make the one less industrious
          and intelligent, the other less disposed to save and invest. "Taxation" which
          falls upon the processes of production interposes an artificial obstacle
        to the creation of wealth.</p>
        <p>If manufactures are taxed the effect is to lessen improvements; tax commerce
          and the effect is to prevent exchange; tax capital, and the effect is to drive
          it away. But the whole rental value of land may be taken as public revenue,
          and the only effect will be to stimulate industry, to open new opportunities
        to capital and to increase the production of wealth.</p>
        <p>The charge on land location values may be assessed and collected with a definiteness
          that partakes of the immovable and inconcealable character of the location
          itself. Were all charges for public revenue placed upon location values, irrespective
          of improvements, generating public revenue would be so simple and clear, and
          public attention would be so directed to it, that valuation of the charge on
          any location could and would be made with the same certainty that a real estate
        agent can determine the price a seller can get for a lot.</p>
        <p>The charge upon location values falls only upon those who receive from society
          a valuable benefit and falls on them in proportion to the benefit they receive.
          It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of that value
          which is the creation of the community. When all location rent is taken via
          legitimate charges for value received for the needs of the community, no citizen
          will have an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by industry,
          skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he or she fairly earns.
          Then, and not until then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural
        return.</p>
        <p><b>Effects of the Remedy</b></p>
        <p>The advantage which will be gained by substituting for the many taxes by which
          the public revenues are now raised, a single just charge levied upon the value
          of locations, will appear more and more important the more it is considered.
          With the removal of all the burdens which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
        production of wealth would increase with a rapidity now undreamed of.</p>
        <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth. Abolishing all taxation
          which now hampers every wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry,
          would be like removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. The present
          method of taxation operates to penalize energy and industry and skill and thrift
          like a fine upon those qualities. If a person builds a ship we make the person
          pay for such temerity, as though an injury had been done to the state; if a
          railroad is opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though it were
          a public nuisance; if a manufactory is erected we levy upon it an annual sum
          which would go far toward making handsome profit. We say we want capital, but
          if any one accumulates it or brings it among us, we penalize him or her for
          it as though we were giving the person a privilege. We punish with a tax those
          who cover barren fields with ripening grain; we fine those who put up machinery
        and clean up a dump.</p>
        <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous burden of penalties
        from productive industry.</p>
        <p>To change the taxation from production to a charge on the value or rent of
          locations would give new stimulus to the production of wealth; it would also
          open new opportunities. For under this system no one would care to hold a location
          unless to use it, and locations now withheld from use would everywhere be thrown
          open to improvement. Millions of acres that today are being used inefficiently
        would return to their natural, pristine state.</p>
        <p>The selling price of locations would fall; speculation in locations would
          receive its death blow; the monopolization of valuable locations would no longer
        pay.</p>
        <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply not merely to agricultural
          land, but to all locations ... everywhere. Everywhere that locations had attained
          value, the generating of public revenue from those values, instead of operating,
          as now, as a fine upon improvement, would operate to motivate improvement.
          Whoever planted an orchard or sowed a field or built a house or built a manufactory,
          no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in location value charges than
          if such locations were kept vacant. The monopolist of agricultural locations
          would be charged as much as though those locations were covered with houses
          and barns, with crops and with stock. The owner of a vacant city lot would
          have to pay as high a charge for the privilege of keeping other people off
          of it until the owner wanted to use it as the neighbor who has a fine house
        upon his lot.</p>
        <p>It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          locations as if those locations were covered with grand hotels or a pile of
        great warehouses filled with costly goods.</p>
        <p>Consider the effect of such change upon the labor market. Competition would
          no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with each other
          for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point of
          bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers, and
          wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. The employers of labor would
          not have merely to bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of
          greater trade and increased profits, but against the ability of laborers to
          become their own employers upon the natural opportunities freely opened to
        them by the location value charge which prevents the monopolization of locations.</p>
        <p>It is manifest, of course that the change proposed here will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of brain or of brawn. And it is likewise
          manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose incomes are drawn
        from the earnings of capital, or from investments other than in locations.</p>
        <p>Farmers, not those who never touch farm equipment, but the working farmers
          who are such a large class in the U.S., will benefit by the proposed change.
          Paradoxical as it may appear to these farmers until they understand the full
          bearings of the proposition, of all classes above that of the laborer such
          farmers have the most to gain by deriving all public revenue from just charges
          on location values. The fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls on them
          with peculiar punitive severity. They are taxed on all their improvements,
          houses, barns, fences, crops, and stock. Farmers pay personal income taxes
          and sales taxes. The personal property which they have cannot be as readily
          concealed or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are concentrated
          in the cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and improvements,
          which the owner of unused locations escapes, but their land is generally taxed
          at a higher rate than land held on speculation, simply because it is improved.
          But further than this all taxes imposed on commodities fall on the farmer without
          mitigation. The farmer would be a gainer by the substitution of a single charge
          upon the value of his or her location instead of all these taxes. The charge
          on location values would fall with greatest weight, not upon the agricultural
          districts, where location values are comparatively small, but upon the towns
          and cities where location values are high; whereas sales taxes and taxes upon
          personal income, personal property and improvements fall as heavily in the
          country as in the city. The result of a charge on location values would be
          that speculative values of locations would be kept down, and that cultivated
          and improved farms would have not payments to make to support government directly
          until the country around them had been well settled. In fact, paradoxical as
          it may at first seem to them, the effect of putting all charges for public
          revenue upon the value of locations would be to relieve the harder working
        farmers of all taxation.</p>
        <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased, it would be equitably distributed.
          Not to mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
          would not be equitable distribution, so long as different individuals have
          different powers and different desires. But wealth would be distributed by
          the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge or prudence of each contributed
          to the common stock. The non producer would no longer roll in luxury while
        the producer got but the barest necessities of animal existence.</p>
        <p>All fear of great fortunes might be dismissed, for when every person gets
          what each fairly earns, no one can get more than he or she fairly earns. How
          many men and women are there who can fairly earn a million dollars a year?

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Enthusiastic proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas have often presented
    them as a panacea for the economic, social and environmental problems that
    beset contemporary society. Indeed, the Georgist analysis does have much
    to offer. By more adequately addressing land as a unique economic, social
    and ecological resource, it can help to reveal underlying causes of currently
    pressing issues such as declining housing affordability, growing economic
    inequality, and environmental decay.</p>
  <p>The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217; can also play an important role
    in the redress of these problems. However, there are limitations to the modern
    application of George&#8217;s ideas, as outlined in this article. While a
    uniform land tax is a necessary component in addressing contemporary political
    economic problems, it is not sufficient. It needs to be set in the context
    of a broader political economic analysis and policy program, also addressing
    public housing, urban and regional policies, environmental taxes and regulations, &#8216;floors
    and ceilings&#8217; to limit income inequalities and macroeconomic stabilisation.</p>
  <p>While the Georgist analysis redresses the general neglect of land in modern
    economic orthodoxy, it is important not to go too far to the other extreme.
    In other words, the important emphasis on land should not come at the expense
    of attention to problems associated with labour and capital and to the complex
    forms of government policy necessary for the balancing of contemporary economic,
    social and ecological concerns. The Georgist analysis needs to be integrated
    into a comprehensive political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism.</p>
  <p>So what does &#8216;putting Henry George in his place&#8217; entail? It
    means recognising the political economic importance of land and the potential
    social gains from the extension of land taxation. Equally, it means recognising
    the necessity of relating Georgist ideas and policy prescriptions to a broader
    canvas of modern political economy, including the analytical traditions associated
    with Karl Marx, J. M. Keynes, and J. K. Galbraith, and modern environmental
    economics. Henry George&#8217;s place is in good company. <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read
