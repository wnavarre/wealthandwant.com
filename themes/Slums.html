        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never
            had the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in
            a lunatic asylum, which does not happen
                  to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent
            from birth. She is well taken care of, because her father left her
            when he
                  died the income of a large farm on the outskirts of a city.
            The city has since grown and the land is now worth, at conservative
            estimate,
                  about twenty million dollars. It is covered with office buildings,
            and
                  the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent by the
            woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good health,
            so she
                  may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
                this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million
                dollars. And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation,
                which would he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society
                which compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order
                to pay her the income of twenty million dollars?</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes
            it easy to see that she is not entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns.
                But how about all the other people who have bought up and are holding
                for speculation the most desirable land? The value of this land increases,
                not because of anything these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful
                service they render to the community &#8212; but purely because
                the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood and
                must have use of the
                land.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
                because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way.
                But it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community
                was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not
                in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted trees, or
                built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work,
                and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid for guessing what
                the rest of us were going to need?</p>

          <p><strong>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing
                game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on
                the farms,
              and slums and luxury in the cities.</strong> A great part of the necessary land
              is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
              until the poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm land also
              increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed,
              because they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. <strong>So
              the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the
              poet, &quot;where wealth
              accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with
              festering slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided
              with enormous
              fortunes, which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot
              intelligently spend.</strong></p>

          <p>This condition wrecked every empire in
            the history of mankind, and it is wrecking modern civilization. One
            of the first to perceive this was
                  Henry George, and he worked out the program known as the Single
            Tax. Let society as a whole take the full rental value of land, so
            that no
                  one would any longer be able to hold land out of use. So the
            value of land would decrease, and everyone could have land, and the
            community
                  would have a great income to be spent for social ends. ... </p>

          <p><strong>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously

              and there among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned
              what he is consuming, and that it has not brought him happiness, and
              is bringing still less to his children. Such men are casting about for
              ways to invest their money without breeding idleness and parasitism.
              Some of them might be grateful to learn about this enclave plan, and
              to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its people are doing

                  <p><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is also to uphold and fortify the
                  tax
                  base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
                  people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
                  skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
                  Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
                  it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
                  Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
                  Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
                  they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the

            <p><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of floorspace rentals on ground
              rents
              and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
              land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
              cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
              inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
              will
              see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
              landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax

            true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
            without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
            new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
            off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope

                develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
                earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
                stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,

                extensive.
                They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
                over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
                crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
                down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
                negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
                neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
                build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
                land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
                public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
                itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
                East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></div>

              you
              drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
              of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of
                a slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
              fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
              neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
              neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
              taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
              It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last. <b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
              renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
              is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,

            That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
            exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a

      enormously-valuable real estate because of our failure to collect the

      capital - two very different things. Where property taxes are actually
      LVT (often termed site value rating at local government level) they are
      equitable and beneficial, but the problem is they are minuscule and
      misapplied in a number of ways. But where property taxes are (more
      commonly) a tax on land and improvements (such as buildings), the
      effect is entirely different. When the owner does, for example, build a
      house or renovate a derelict building, up will go his/her property
      taxes!</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>What society needs is a tax system which encourages land to be
      put to
      its optimum use, and for productive labour to be free of punitive
      taxation. Instead we have a system in which it is profitable for
      landowners to sit and wait for their land value to appreciate, while
      honest enterprise is treated as a cash cow by our tax system. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Our conditioning has somehow led us to accept this economic and
      social madness. <span style="font-style: italic;">We
      might travel to work and glance at an empty block of land worth
      millions of dollars, yet not think twice about it. Once we arrive at
      work, however, our mind-set is - curiously - very different. Hey! - the
      new printing press or forklift truck has arrived, worth a hundred
      thousand dollars! How long do you think management will let this
      valuable piece of machinery lie idle on the factory floor?</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The same profit motive that compels someone to tear off the
      shrink-wrap
      at once and get their new equipment working can also be applied to the
      occupancy of land. To drive the point home so that your
      all-taxes-are-the-same programming is forever deleted, take an everyday
      example of a valuable block of land a person might occupy. The land's
      value has been built up by the community as a result of the surrounding
      amenities, so the occupier is rightly subject to a certain amount of
      LVT. Knowing the assessed LVT, the land will put people to work rather
      than weeds. Or, if the land is really valuable, it might have a modern,
      efficient multi-story building on it rather than an old single-story
      building or a car park.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Renewal as
      intensification.</b> George observed land speculation in California
      when it was young and raw. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Today, an
      equally or more baneful aspect
      of underusing land is found in older blighted slums, where underuse
      takes the form of non-renewal. Thus, land of high capacity is
      providing only minimal service and employment. Why do we not get
      timely renewal? The most obvious reason is that the sites under old
      buildings bear low tax valuations, because assessors mistake the
      building for the site and overlook its reuse value, or opportunity
      cost.</span> Let the owner renew the site, and taxes shoot up: not only
      on
      the new building, but often on the site as well. Result: nonrenewal.
      So capital that should go to renew these sites of high potential
      migrates outward instead, to where tax rates are lower and subsidies
      are higher, wasting capital in duplicating the infrastructure, and of
    course also wasting land. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Many Georgists
      fail to see that a major part of the problem is
      underassessment of the land. </span>Land is underassessed when
      tax-valuers
      lapse into using the &#8220;building-first, land-residual&#8221; method
      of separating land from building values. This results in land
      valuations so absurdly low that one observes, in many cities and
      neighborhoods, most of the joint value of land/building being
      allocated to the building in the very year that the owner chooses to
      demolish the building, i.e. when the building really no longer has
      any value at all. Then the assessor raises the land valuation under
      the new, or replacement building &#8211; making the land tax in effect
      an additional tax on the new building. The correct method is the
&#8220;land-first, building-residual&#8221; method: value the land as
      though vacant, and give the old building the excess, if any, of the
      joint value over the land value. Then the land value remains fixed
      when a new building arises, and the land tax serves, as it should, as
      a stimulus to rebuilding (Gaffney, 2001).<a href="../docs/Gaffney_FEFPOASP-RPWHTE.html"> Read

    Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
    Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
      one
      thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
      the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
      political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
      tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
      address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
      could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
      buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
      the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
      powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
      efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
      site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
      is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
      <br>
      <font size="3"><small>What determines one's new bottom line is how
      intensely one uses land.
      
</small></font></small>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font size="3"><small>The PTS raises the tax burden on low
      intensity users of land, such as:
      slum lords, car dealers, speculators sitting on unused land, mall
      owners and probably their tenants, and farmers on land near a city's
      limits, assessed according to potential use, and not granted
      deferments.</small></font></small></li>
        <li><small><font size="3"><small>On the other hand, owners of homes,
      condos, apartments,
      neighborhood-based, pedestrian-friendly businesses, and industrial
      facilities generally use land intensively. The PTS would save them
      money, although only slightly for home owners, based on studies of King
      and Clark Counties, WA (Gihring, 1994, 1996).

      <small><font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS would
      replace
      is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
      land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
      owners for improving. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This negative
      incentive does its greatest damage
      at the margin, where profit is slim. There, rather than pay a higher
      tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums.</span> The lack of
      much tax
      on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
      incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
      from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.<br>
      <br>
      Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land. Leap-frog
      development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
      values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
      previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. The resultant
      sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
      makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
      <br>
      The PTS reverses all these negative consequences.

      development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it

      and special preferences for landowners whittle down their taxes or turn
      real estate losses into profits. The 1986 Tax Reform Act aims to reduce
      these privileges, but landowners&#8217; past ingenuity in avoiding taxation
      warrants continued vigilance over tax structures. At the local level,
      the property tax rises for owners who build or improve their homes,
      rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
      those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of

      <p><small>When analysing property
      taxes
      we shall distinguish between that part of
      the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
      assessed on land. </small></p>
      <p>      <small>"A survey made by the editors of
        Fortune found that during the 1950's the population in metropolitan
        areas increased by about 400,000 persons annually. About 250,000
        housing units were built yearly in these areas, but almost the same
        number were lost by demolition, condemnation or conversion into
        industrial use. Thus the housing shortage increased by about 400,000
        persons each year. The editors of Fortune concluded that the battle
        against slums will be decided by the simple arithmetic of new buildings
      versus immigration to the cities." ...</small></p>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That part of the tax that is
      assessed on buildings penalizes everybody
      who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
      residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
      incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
      houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
    cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ever widening gap between
      the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
      squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
      the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
      groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
      conditions.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In the press, on the radio and on television we are often warned
      about the threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the
      increase in the cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase
      in housing costs brought about by the housing shortage. The
      inflationary effects of property taxation are reinforced by the fact
      that property taxes themselves are included in the cost of living index
      and that property tax rates have the tendency to rise.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>To the extent that property taxes discourage residential
      construction and the improvement and modernization of homes they create
      unemployment. The housing construction industry employed about
      2,200,000 people in 1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit.
      Any change in the direction of home building employment is multiplied
      2.57 times. Thus an increase in housing starts by 50% would give
      employment to 2.8 million persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3
      would create about 3.6 million jobs. These figures do not take into
      consideration the investment in public utilities, streets, schools
      etc., that would be required to service these additional housing units.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Under our property tax system wealthy communities with expensive
      homes
      or with heavy concentration of industry will have a large tax basis and
      low tax rates. Schools will be good and public services will be
      adequate. Yet in a poor community the tax base will be much smaller,
      tax rates will be much higher and still it will be found impossible to
      provide for good schools and adequate public services.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In a pamphlet entitled <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Paying for better
      schools</span> the Committee for Economic Development came to the
      conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"where a

      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
      defect
      of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
      premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
      because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
      taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
      depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
      of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
      constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
      <br>
      <small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
      rising
      trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
      the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
      procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
      favor obsolete real property. ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that
      has
      taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
      rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
      cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
      tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
      more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
      been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
      properties. </span><small><big><big><small><a

    (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;

      <p><small><b>An Open Violation of the
      Principles of Justice</b>
        </small><br>
        <small>Under such a state of things one may well ask, is it in human
      nature that anyone could have the heart or the enterprise to expend
      his labour and capital on the permanent improvement of the soil
      exclusively for the benefit of others, and with a certainty that he
      will be charged an increased rent for the use of his own
      property?</small></p>
      <p><small>How can any government allow the land of a
        nation to
        remain in the
        hands of a class of men who will not improve it themselves, or allow
        others to improve it either? How can any just government suffer any
        longer a system of Land Tenure which inflicts irreparable ruin on the
        general industry and prosperity of a nation, and which is maintained
        solely for the purpose of giving the landlords an opportunity of
        plundering the class of industrious, improving tenants which it is
        specially bound to protect and defend? <a
