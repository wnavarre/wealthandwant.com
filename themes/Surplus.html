</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The big question, of course, is "who is
  entitled to the surplus?"&nbsp; Much rides on how we answer this
  question.&nbsp; America's traditional answer is that the landlord gets
  it, supplemented by some other goodies.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Do you remember the story, perhaps
    apocrypal,  from the early days of computerization that computer
    programmers in a few banks initially arranged things so that the fractional
    cents of interest which would have been applied to individual
    customers' accounts would be &quot;harvested&quot; into their own accounts?
    Well, <strong>the social surplus is a lot more than rounding error. It is
    more like the
    difference
    between
    the cost of living in rural Alabama and the cost of living in Manhattan.
    Who is it that is entitled to that? </strong>The landlords, or all of us? Our society's
    current answer seems to be that the landlord is entitled, just as the slaveholder
    of the 19th century was entitled to what his slaves produced. Georgists see
    that the privatization of the common treasure is a source of many of our
    most troubling &#8212; and supposedly intractible &#8212; social and economic
    problems.</p>
  <p> Henry George had a
    better answer &#8212; one that acknowledges that the landlord is not "God's
    Eldest Son" and that we are all created equal, and are thus equally
    entitled to what the earth and the community provide.&nbsp; This sounds
    as if it would be good in theory but difficult to implement, but it
    turns out that <strong><em>it is very simple to implement</em></strong>.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Virtually every
    municipality in America already assesses property values.&nbsp; Some do
    it more accurately than others, but with the advent of CAMA
    (Computer-Aided Mass Assessment), it is possible to do more accurate
    assessments, particularly of land values, which tend to vary with some
    fairly predictable patterns.&nbsp; (See <a href="Assessment.html">Assessment</a>, <a href="Land_Value_Mapping.html">Land
    Value Mapping</a>) <br>

If the industry is perfectly competitive, firms being price takers,
there is no economic profit, yet the surplus is a return beyond costs.
The surplus does not go to the owners of the firms, but, as Friedman
states, flows through to the input factor owners. Going beyond
Friedman, it should be clear that if markets for labor and capital
goods, too, are perfectly competitive, they too have no super-normal
returns, so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only other
place the surplus can go to is to geo-rent.
In a fully perfectly competitive model, &#8220;producer surplus&#8221; does not go

  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>
  <p>If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
      enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
      kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working
    for it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
      so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
      be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
      of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined
      when the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages
      to the
      individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the
      Single Tax. 110</p>

Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
    and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of
    taxation
    with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
    building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor
    continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course
    of a shift
    from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had earlier
    encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212; the
    product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land by
    itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
    altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
    formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
  <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and rent
      as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the surplus
      produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
      to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form of
      taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by shifting
      taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance of markets
      would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless to taxpayers.
      This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now possible to demonstrate
      with the advent of computer power and available data. It amplifies and validates
      what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical claim. We can now
      show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the services demanded
      of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that exceeds all others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And
      unlike other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive. Economic
      rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates through the
      markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
      result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price. Economic
      rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason, and comes
      about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by the consequence
      rather of society's collective effort. British political economist David Ricardo
      first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to agricultural production
      in the early 1800s, but its applicability today is understood far more easily
      with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas ground rent to Ricardo reflected
      the differential gifts of nature inherent in various land sites, it is today
      better understood as reflective of locational differentials in the capacities
      of communities.</p>
  <p>This is relatively easy to understand by considering a vacant expanse
        of land that has imposed upon it a grid of roads like a tic-tac-toe board.
        Suppose
      each of the squares were privately owned, and development of those sites
      were
      to ensue, the economic surplus generated by that market activity would
    raise the value of each of those locations. Let's further suppose that every
    site
      were developed except the center square, that titleholder choosing instead
      to just hold his title vacant. Which land site, discounting the building
      values, would command the greatest market price after a short time? The
    center square,
      of course &#8212; even though that owner made no effort to earn that increase
      in price. The center square would see the greatest accretion of economic
      rent because of its strategic access. It would be the passive beneficiary
      of the
      surplus generated by the common enterprise of all the market exchanges
      resulting from the other locations. In just this way rent becomes the social
      creation
      of the community and not the result of any private individual's enterprise.
      The more the economic activity, the more the surplus generated comes to
      settle on land in the form of rent. Rent accretes to land sites and raises
      their
      market value, directly reflecting the varying levels of productive economic
      surplus
      generated over time throughout a community. High economic productivity
      yields high surplus rent. ... </p>
  <p><strong>The Rent in Cities</strong></p>
  <p>The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the economic
    rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes to settle
    on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market price of
    sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced ground rent
    in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect on sites but could
    be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the services that cities are
    bound to perform. As will be evident below, the amount of economic rent available
    for recovery is thought sufficient to pay for all services and then some. Today
    it simply collects on sites of greatest activity with typical and visible negative
    consequences.</p>
  <p>One might suppose that collecting the economic rent would leave locational
    sites with less market price appreciation, stabilizing land prices at levels
    that are more within reach for various developments. To be sure collecting
    economic rent exerts a downward pressure on market prices. But there is a countervailing
    pressure that works to neutralize whatever tendencies are otherwise at work:
    the collection of rent, especially from high-value sites, increases the carrying
    costs in ways that provides a greater inducement for their titleholders to
    improve them. That incentive fosters development in areas that, together in
    combination with other activity generated in neighborhoods, tends to maintain
    the stability of land markets in a roughly constant pattern.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
rent is a taxable surplus</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">a. Relative elasticities</span>.</small><br>
<small>Land rent is nearly identical with taxable surplus.&nbsp; This
follows from simply observing that the supplies of labor and capital
are highly elastic, while the supply of land (within any given taxing
jurisdiction ) is totally inelastic, because&nbsp; a "jurisdiction" is
defined as a specific area of land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and the &#8220;Physiocrats,&#8221; and their
fellow-traveler A.R. Jacques Turgot, deduced from the above that almost
all taxes, whatever the nominal base, are shifted to land rents, and
lodge there.&nbsp; Market forces tend to equalize all AFTER-tax returns
to labor and capital, because of their mobility or, in the case of some
labor, the inability of humans to survive on less than subsistence
wages. </small><br>
<br>
<small>As a corollary, if there is no rent there is nothing to
tax.&nbsp; E. R. A. Seligman in one of his exhortations against the
single tax, warned that a marginal community --one on land of no value
-- can have no tax base if it taxes only land. However, this
hypothetical community can have no tax base anyway.&nbsp; Whatever
labor or capital it tries to tax will leave, or never arrive, because
their supplies are elastic.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital will only appear to bear a tax if it can shift it to
land in the form of lower rent, or a lower purchase price.&nbsp; If
rent and land values are already zero, there is nowhere to shift a
tax.&nbsp; Mobile factors will not bear it, but turn away.&nbsp;
Customers will not bear it, but buy elsewhere.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>Seligman does not consider the interesting possibility that
public services paid by taxation might create the very rents that are
taxed to support the public services.&nbsp; That complex question would
make an interesting book, but one too long to insert here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>b.&nbsp; The surplus is much more than usually stated.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer has dealt with this elsewhere
(Gaffney, 1970, 1993), and is currently writing a book on the
subject.&nbsp; Cf. also B-12.&nbsp; The failure of modern economists,
whether neo-classical or heterodox, to acknowledge the Himalayan Range
of land values in their faces, and to reckon its role in theory and
policy, is denial and delusion on a scale at which one can only marvel.

in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,

<a href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Gaffney_LRiaTFS.html"></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Rents are a taxable surplus.
I estimate that this taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the
national income in most nations with market economies, and more in
resource-rich nations. ...</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;2. The value of rent is huge. Every economy produces a
large excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some of
it goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not part
of the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return of
capital. ... </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;3. Rent will become huger yet when you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now depress
the rent of land. That is, in a tax-free market economy, the benefit of
abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The taxable
surplus simply shifts from one form to another. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This is more than a simple shift of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods.</small><br>
<small>4. Some of the benefit of abating
existing taxes will
lodge in higher after-tax wage rates, rather than higher rents. ... </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;5. Many varieties of natural resources generate rents.
City land is the greatest single source. For example, one city,
Vancouver, contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a
province of 934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France. ...</small>

Distributive Socialism when the enhanced land rents are tapped to

Socialism we need to define
"<b><i>surpluses</i></b>." These are primarily rents from lands and

Land rent is the basic taxable surplus. Where there is no land rent,
an attempt to levy any tax can only abort production and land use,
rather than collect the tax. Where is there no land rent? </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First,
there is no rent generated on "marginal" land that is just barely

  <li><small>Second, and more generally, there is no rent
generated by marginal increments of labor and capital applied on any
land, from the best to the worst.

  <li><small>Otherwise, all production on land
generates some rent, which is a taxable surplus. </small></li>

  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
  Net Product of
  Land is the Taxable Surplus</span>
    </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    </small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A. To socialize the taxable
  surplus,
  land rent,
  effectively, you must define
  and identify it carefully, and structure your taxes to
  home in on it. </span>Taxable
  surplus means a value you can collect in taxes without
  destroying, or even
  diminishing it, or driving it away. In practice this means
  mostly land rent, because the supply of land is fixed -- what
  economists call "inelastic" -- however much or
  little you tax it. </small><br>
  <small>&nbsp;
  </small><br>
  <small>Land rent is the same as the Net Revenue of land, that is
  the Gross Revenue less
  the cost of mobile human inputs (including capital) needed
  to make land yield the
  revenue. Accountants generally divide these mobile human
  inputs into two parts:
  current expenses and durable capital. The durable capital
  has to be converted to
  an annual equivalent, to make capital costs commensurable
  with annual
  expenses. This is done by multiplying the value of capital
  on the land times the
  sum of an interest rate plus a depreciation rate. ...[Formulas
  follow]&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> B. Taxable surplus is also
  what you
  can tax without
  driving land into the
  wrong use.</span> It is not enough that the land supply is fixed:
  a tax must not force
  underuse or other misuse of the fixed supply.
  </small><br>
  <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  </small><br>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of
  taxing
  rent is that it does not
  change the ranking of land
  uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let me explain.
  </small><br>
  <small>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  </small><br>
  <small>In a free market, the function of rent is
  to sort and arrange land uses:
  landowners allocate land to those
  uses yielding the most net product, or rent. Economists
  have shown (and you can
  easily see) that this is socially advantageous: the net
  product is the excess of
  revenue over all costs, so land yielding the highest rent
  is adding its utmost to the
  national product.&nbsp; ... </small></p>
  <p> <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you base a tax on taxable surplus,
    and keep the tax proportional to taxable surplus, you levy taxes without
    twisting and inverting the landowner's or land manager's ranking of land
    uses. </span>As noted before, the owner's preferred use after tax remains
    the same as it would be without any tax. On
the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">if you
tax on some other basis</span> (Gross Revenue, for example), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">you
bias the owner
against uses more heavily taxed.</span></span> To keep the example simple, and
generally
realistic, we assume here that the seller is a "price-taker," meaning he sells
on a world market and cannot raise the price, and so has no choice but to bear
the tax. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Bear in mind that Net Revenue is the Taxable Surplus: you cannot tax more than
that without aborting the land use. The ratio of Costs (C) to Gross Revenue (G)
varies over a wide range, from zero up nearly to one (and even above one for
subeconomic uses which, however, you do not want). Let's compare two rival uses,
A and B, for the same piece of land. Use "A" yields more Net Revenue (N), but
has a higher ratio of C/G. We levy a tax of 10% on Gross Revenue (G). To simplify,
Expenses and Capital Costs are consolidated as "C", so N = G-C. Table 1 shows
the effects of the tax on Net Revenue after Tax
(NAT).<br>

  <p>The higher use, A, produces more goods, makes more jobs, and yields more
    Net Product: it is clearly the higher use. The tax on G [Gross Revenue],
    however, turns A into a lower use than B, in the eyes of the landowner or
    manager. A 10% tax on G is a 100% tax on the N from use A, wiping out the
    entire incentive to put land to use A. It is a 40% tax on the N from use
    B, leaving 60% of the Net Product for the landowner. The landowner would
    choose use A in the absence of taxes, or with a tax on N; but the tax on
    G forces him to choose use B, which is socially inferior. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This,
    in a nutshell, expresses the damage done by imposing taxes on bases other
  than N, the Net Revenue of land. </span>  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The tax lowers output, employment, and investment opportunities for capital,
    all three.    </li>
    <li>Fourth, it lowers tax revenues well below their maximum possible level
      of $10k, the Net Revenue from use A. ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>... The taxable surplus available from taxing the Net Product of land goes
    on forever, and grows as land rents grow. It is not like the false "revenue" that
    comes from privatizing land, which the IMF et al. would have you do. Selling
    the title to land gives money to the government currently in power, which
    this government is prone to treat as current income and spend right away:
    but it is not permanent income, any more than you would call it income when
    you sell your farm or home. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To have income, permanent income, you must
    reserve the right to tax land forever, and use that income for public purposes
  or social dividends. </span></p>
  <p>If you think you need cash immediately, in excess of current taxable surplus,
    you can always borrow on the security of the tax revenue you have reserved
    for your government. There are certain dangers in mortgaging your public
    revenues like that, and I would counsel prudence and caution; but these dangers
    are small and uncertain compared with the certain disaster that will follow
    if you sell land forever, without
reserving any power to tax it in the future. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The U.S.A. fell into this trap in the 19th Century. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Federal Government supported itself
for years by selling off its vast public domain, a domain so vast that generations
of politicians came and went who thought of these sales revenues as a kind of
income.</span> After a while, though, the land was all gone. Then we had to turn
to excise taxes, and income taxes, which have now grown so high they will slowly
strangle us. Those of us who foresee this danger now look to you, Russia, with
your vast undeveloped resources in public ownership, to avoid our errors and
become, as we once fancied ourselves, the "last best hope of earth." We look
to you to convert your nation from its status as a wretched colony from which
people would escape, to a refuge of new opportunity for your own people, and
for the "huddled masses, yearning to breathe free" of
the whole world. </p>

Land Values</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When considering world-wide
economics, most people think that land
rent contributes only a small insignificant portion of value. But as
societies progress, land has become the predominant force in
determining the progress or poverty of all people within a community.
Land in major or cities is so costly that people are forced to move
further away and travel great distances in order to get to work and
social attractions. In the more developed countries of the world,
land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual production.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since land is fixed in supply, as
more land is demanded by people
the rent will increase proportionally. Demand is the sole determinant
of land rent. Changes in land rent and land taxes have no impact on
the supply of land, because the land supply is fixed and cannot be
significantly expanded. Labor and capital are variable in supply. A
higher price for commodities causes more labor and capital to make
itself available. Labor and capital are rewarded for their work. A
high price is an incentive to work harder and longer, while a low
price is not an incentive to work harder and longer.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land, however, serves
no such incentive function,
because the supply of land is fixed. The same amount is available no
matter how high or low the price. Buildings are not a part of land
rent. Land rent results from the desire made by everyone who lives
within a community to use land. Economic rent is the only source of
revenue that could be taken for community purposes without having any
negative effect on the productive potential of the economy.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economists consider rent to
be a surplus payment which is unnecessary
to ensure that land is available. </span>When a community captures
land rent
for public purposes, both efficiency and equity are realized. ... <a

Economic Development</b>
</small><br>
<small>Economic theory recognizes that when government places taxes on
production and on commerce the net result is a reduction in those
activities. The reason this occurs is that these taxes add to the
cost of production and to the cost of doing business. The ideal
public policy would be to reduce taxes on production and commerce and
raise public revenue from non-distorting revenue sources.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That non-distorting revenue source
is land and natural resources.
The central problem which limits the operational success of the
economy is the failure to procure the public value which is created
by the community. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This value ought to be reserved
for the community to pay for
public improvements. However, this value is to a large extent
diverted into private pockets by speculation in land and natural
resource values. The correct approach is to create a system in which
no-one, except the citizenry as a whole, is rewarded by the
collection of publicly created values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists can agree that the
economically efficient public
finance system is one in which revenue is drawn from the rent that
people pay for the use of land and natural resources. These payments
do not distort economic activity. Land rent, because it is pure
surplus, could be taken and used for any purpose and there would be
no negative consequences for the allocation of labor and capital, or
in the use of land and natural resources. If this surplus is invested
in needed infrastructure and other public services, it will in turn
increase land values for future public investment.&nbsp; ... <a

    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land nationalisation.
    But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on land could be effective
    in capturing the economic surplus arising from land ownership. This tax would
    generate all the revenue necessary to fund public expenditures. George thought
    that such a land tax would permit the removal of other taxes on labour and
    capital, which he regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued that taxes
    on incomes, sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives to production
    and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and creating a barrier
    to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be both economically efficient
    and more equitable in its distributional effects. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. <strong>He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended
    by human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to
    land.</strong>    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The concept of rent needs
further explication precisely because it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production.</span> To take just an
elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise. But <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return. </span>... <a
