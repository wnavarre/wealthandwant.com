  <div align="left"><small><b>The Need to
          Correct for Regression Fallacy, or Which Top 10% Do You Mean?</b></small>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most studies of property tax
regressivity stumble squarely into
the pratfall of regression fallacy. The problem in brief is this.
Income and property are positively related but the scatter of points
is loose, with great individual residuals from any fitted curve, and
a high error of estimate. We want to know which rises faster as they
rise together. The answer depends on which we arbitrarily select as
the ranking variable. Let us say we rank by income on the abscissa
and find the top 10% have 30% of the income and 25% of the property
(a hypothetical number). It looks as though the property tax is
regressive. But now rank them by property on the ordinate. The top
10% are now a different group -we have taken a stratum of points at
right angles to the original column. Some of the humble have been
exalted, and the mighty laid low. This top 10% has say 50% of the
property and 25% of the income, and the property tax looks
progressive (in terms of
income).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(31)</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the <i>Census of Housing</i>
ranks families by income, rent
payments do not keep up with
income.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(32)</i></b></small></font> But
ranking them by
value of dwelling units, value quintuples while income only
doubles.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(33)</i></b></small></font> That
is the
difference a technical detail or two can make.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So which top 10% do we mean? Most
studies have uncritically
chosen income as the proper ranking variable, by assumption, thus
practically preordaining the conclusion - and largely invalidating
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Chicago school of permanent
income hypothesizers have
counterattacked sharply on the housing salient. Margaret Reid
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(34)</i></b></small></font> undertook to
narrow the
scatter of points by removing random year-to-year income changes. She
related housing to a definition of permanent income, and came up
with income-elasticity of demand for housing well above unity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of Reid's methods of avoiding
regression fallacy was the
interarea comparison, where data are grouped by a neutral variable
(neighborhood) which is neither housing nor income. Brodsky has
repeated this for Census Tracts of the District of Columbia. His
findings strike me because he is a geographer who is not concerned
with the permanent income or regressivity question and presents his
findings just as interesting facts. He finds residential improvement
values rise with the 1.3 power of income; land values rise with the
1.8 power.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(35)</i></b></small></font> Muth
has refined
and expanded Reid's method!;. He now suggests 1.2 or 1.3 as correct
income-elasticities of demand for
housing.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(36)</i></b></small></font> Lee
has criticized
Reid's methods and come up with an elasticity of about .81. However,
Lee's data were too small a sample to lean on heavily, and more
important they excluded land. We have seen that land is the most
progressive share of housing, so this biases Lee's findings
downwards.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">But
these are only glancing blows. The central question is, why
rank by income at all -any concept of income?</span> When we do that we
accept income-fundamentalism, a kind of philosophical imperialism
where Adjusted Gross Income on Form 1040 is the basic reference datum
against which to measure and judge everything. "Similar
circumstances" mean similar AGI, and similar circumstances deserve
similar taxes. In effect this means we judge the property tax on the
basis of how closely it resembles the income tax, in every detail.
Since nothing resembles the income tax so much as the income tax, the
property tax looks inferior.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, the concept called
"income-elasticity of demand for wealth"
contains implicit income - Chauvinism. It implies one-way causation:
income causes wealth. But wealth also causes income, and as Klein
points out that changes the rules for relating them.88 No longer can
income be the simple ranking variable.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the property tax had no
rationale of its own we would be forced
to accept income fundamentalism. But if the property tax has a
rationale, then it is legitimate to rank by wealth, and fault the
income tax for failing to tax large properties adequately. Here is
an outline rationale for the property tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
"Ability-to-pay" derives from wealth as well as current income. </span>James
Tobin, Arnold Zellner, Taylor and Houthakker, Harold Somers,
and others have stressed this lately. The old cliche that "taxes are
paid out of income" is as empty as the one that we consume "out of
income." We spend money, and it is not labelled.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.
The
property tax asserts a public equity in land which was won
and is defended by joint efforts, and whose value derives from public
works and spillovers, not from the owners' efforts.</span> It exempts
human
effort, thus rewarding service to the community and denying the state
any equity in the bodies of its citizens whose freedom and dignity is
thus enhanced in their capacity as human beings, as distinct from
owners of wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.
Property taxes reduce the differential effect of inherited
wealth on the current generation.</span> They strike directly at
concentration of economic and other power based on wealth, promoting
competition and equal opportunity. Property as collateral is a
source of invisible income (credit rating). Taxing property reduces
the differential advantage of the rich in credit rationing.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.
Property income of a given dollar value places the receiver on
a higher welfare plane than labor income, because he needn't work for
it.</span> $10,000 a year received by dint of working long hours in a
coal
mine with black lung disease is not the same as $10,000 plus a life
of ease.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.
The
property tax is needed to plug loopholes in the income tax,
which is inexorably devolving into a payroll tax.</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If one finds that rationale
compelling, then the proper approach
is to rank by wealth. Doing so, one finds that property is used
regressively, i.e., the larger holdings generate less taxable sales
and income per dollar of wealth. Thus in the Milwaukee industries
reported in Table
1,
ranking by value, the top 10% who have 89% of the value have only 69%
of the employees.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If one likes the property tax
rationale partly but not wholly,
then he may follow Wallis and Roberts
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(39)</i></b></small></font> who tell us
that to avoid
regression fallacy a valid way to compare two populations is to
compare their standard deviations <i>or other measure of
variability</i>. If there is less income than property in the upper
groups, the variability of the income distribution will be less. But
we have already seen that is so (Table
1). Table I only gives the top group, but in each case I have
computed Gini (or Lorenz concentration) ratios for the entire
distribution, and they are as you would expect much higher than for
income. (The Gini ratio is, in my experience, closely correlated with
the coefficient of dispersion.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The more we correct for regression
fallacy, then, the more
progressive the property tax looks.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>On Defining
Income and Wealth</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dick Netzer, like others, uses AGI
as the reference standard
against which to match the property tax and find it
regressive.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(40)</i></b></small></font> A
certain
citizen in 1970 reported no AGI, but heavy property taxes, which
might make the property tax quite regressive were it not Ronald
Reagan. Yet he is not alone, and it seems harsh to select a measure
that makes the property tax regressive because it is the only tax
many rich men pay. General Oppenheimer has written a fine set of
manuals on how to reach Zero AGI by losing money
farming,<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(41)</i></b></small></font> and
they work so
well that taxable farm income is down to about $3 billions while the
USDA estimates farm income at $14
billions.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(42)</i></b></small></font> I do
not think
that AGI will do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just farming. Property
is the paramount tax shelter. How
does it cover thee? Let me count the ways. There is </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>expensing of intangibles and soil and water conservation, </small></li>
  <li><small>percentage depletion, </small></li>
  <li><small>capital gains rates, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferred realization, </small></li>
  <li><small>non-distribution of profits, </small></li>
  <li><small>nonrealization, </small></li>
  <li><small>conversion of interest into cost recovery by watered sales
prices, </small></li>
  <li><small>accelerated depreciation, </small></li>
  <li><small>multiple depreciation, </small></li>
  <li><small>de facto expensing of capital improvements, </small></li>
  <li><small>deduction of interest, </small></li>
  <li><small>covert write-off of undepreciated land value, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferral of tax beyond date of sale, and many others.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same time, property is a
large source of income that is not
counted in AGI. Unrealized accruals and imputed income are the most
obvious, and each is a huge item.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus the ownership of property
tends on a large scale to reduce
AGI and increase real income. When we rank by AGI, property owners
move into lower brackets than they belong; non-owners move into
higher brackets.</b> Property tax payments move into the lower
brackets, pre-ordaining a finding of regressivity which is totally
illusory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At least two studies have sought
to correct for the Reagan Effect.
Both corrected only partially, and with spectacular results. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The Survey Research Center made the tax progressive simply
by
including imputed income.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(43)</i></b></small></font>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Brainin and Germanis do a similar job with California data.<font
 size="-1"><small><b><i>(44)</i></b></small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another common method is to define
property tax payments as only
the net burden after deducting payments from taxable income. This is
to impute a regressive feature of the income tax to the property tax.
That would be wrong at best, but more so when one is comparing the
property tax with the income tax itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If one does choose to evaluate the
two taxes jointly, he should
note above all that the Federal Government has moved far toward
abandoning the taxation of property income. That is the cumulative
effect of a hundred loopholes, available to property but not to the
poor stiff with his W-2 Form. Equity suggests that state and local
treasuries move in on this unpreempted tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Definition of the property tax
base is also a source of serious
error in a number of studies based on cash rents. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Netzer for example
assumes that property taxes are proportional to rents. They aren't. The
base is not rent but capital value. The poor live in declining
neighborhoods and buildings nearing abandonment, where capital value
is a very low multiple of rent.</span> Rents include high costs for
collection, turnover, damage, loss of status, maintenance and
repairs, and general unpleasantness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
Milwaukee's "Inner Core" or
slum area the rule of thumb is you pay 30 months' rent to buy a
dwelling unit. </span>Tenant incomes are low, but higher than such
capital
values. The rich live in new buildings of long future life in
appreciating neighborhoods. Incomes are high, but normally less than
half of lot or acreage plus house values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is true that slums are often
overassessed, but again,
maladministration is the fault of administrators. The property tax
in concept is progressive precisely because it is based on capital
value. Owners of appreciating property often complain that capital
value as a base hits them harder than would current income or service
flow as a base, and they are right. That is precisely what makes the
property tax, correctly administered, so progressive.&nbsp; ... <a
